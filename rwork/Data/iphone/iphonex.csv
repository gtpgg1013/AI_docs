"2","The screen was cracked and the phone did not turn in after 24 hours of charging.
            "
"3","This refurbished phone was sold by Magic Mobile Partners. They replaced my phone screen with some junk third party one that had a defective backlight. These are two identical used iPhone X¡¯s Side by side running the same backup of my phone so the settings were identical. Verified under control center brightness, True Tone, night shift, and display accommodations. This was not a setting. These guys wasted my time and money. Buy elsewhere.
            "
"4","There is the phone that is all. No headphone, no original charger, no original box. I felt kinda scared.
            "
"5","This product is falsely labeled as unlocked, it's been 4 weeks since I informed that the phone was still locked and all I get are excuses.Plus, the phone came in a really bad condition, so many scratches you can see them very clearly.
            "
"6","I love it! It looks just like brand new and everything works great. My international SIM card worked perfectly! I'm really happy with it.
            "
"7","Phone is basically New, everything works, no scratches or anything, fast delivery. Very satisfied !!
            "
"8","Works well.Came with a good bubble wrap protection.Accessories are not original, came with power lightning cable and USB charger.

            "
"10","all right, phone is new, I recommend them, thanks
            "
"11","Really nice phone, smallMinor scuffing by the power button but it¡¯s in excellent shape. Worked great going from older iPhone SE on T-Mobile. Took out SIM card and put in new device and worked automatically.
            "
"12","I got the phone it came it a sketchy box and only with a charger and some paper. with a funky wrap around it. I got it out and it barely had any charge on it so I had to charge it before setup. once I got halfway threw the set up it turned black and said it was to to hot to function when it defiantly wasn't hot at all this was very disappointing. over all, after set up its a nice phone just couldn't get over the repetition of the same problem and so I had it refunded.
            "
"13","The screen of the iPhone has a lots of scratches. I removed the screen protector that the seller had put on it and found out about the poor state of the screen. Refurbished means that product has been renewed, so a screen without scratches would have been much appreciated given the high price tag!
            "
"14","This phone is as good as new. Everything works perfectly. It came with the charger as well.
            "
"15","The device doesn¡¯t support LTE plus poor housing box it arrived in. Other things works fine. Breakdown of the price is necessary for what I received <U+0001F915>
            "
"16","Wow! I really thought that this could go south, however, once it arrived it was working as a brand new iPhone, luckily I had a key to open the SIM tray, otherwise I would have had a hard time finding a way to open it. It's been now almost 3 weeks since first started to use the phone and not one trace of a damage or defect has been found and I like all of the features it includes. Kudos to the seller Electronic Deals who sent this one like new and made me happy for the upgrade from iPhone 6 to iPhone X.
            "
"17","+The exterior of the refurbished iPhone X I ordered was just like new!  not a single scratch!+I live in Germany and this unlocked phone worked flawlessly with the German network.+It came with the front protective glass screen already installed.  Nice touch!+It also had (aftermarket) charger and cable.-The max battery capacity is at 94% when compared to a new one, but I guess that is somewhat expected for a refurbished phones
            "
"18","I was a bit hesitant to order this phone because I've never ordered a phone from a retailer instead of the company itself. It arrived on the date predicted and I've had it for about three weeks now. It showed up in a plain white box in a bit of a dirty envelope but the phone itself was fine, it didn't have any scratches or dents or anything. Managed to set it up with my service provider that same day. It turned up with about 20% charge, a charger, and a SIM card pin. I recommend order headphone jack adapters or lightning headphones before you get this phone, if this is your first time using an iPhone like me. All things considered, a good purchase.
            "
"19","Apple X, cant say enough. I purchase this phone used and unlocked for $850. the phone screen came fast but was blemished or scratched under screen protector. I don't really care. Good phone. Don't buy phones from bit phone companies.  They swindle you out of $1200 for long pay.
            "
"20","Arrived faster than expected. The set up was very easy. Product looks and functions like new. No scratches or dents. Just be careful from what seller you buy from. I got from BUYSPRY and I have no complaints.
            "
"21","No scratches, works great, would recommend
            "
"22","Bought this for my husband and have absolutely no complaints. Looks like a brand new phone. The only thing to note is that you receive a generic charger and no headphones as you would with a brand new phone. But for the price difference, its worth buying your own headphones. I liked the peace of mind having 90 days to use it to make sure it works correctly. So far it is perfect.
            "
"23","Simply amazing. Everything working perfectly, including the charger that is shipped with the phone. Couldn¡¯t be happier. Spending so much money online made me nervous of a scam, but luckily this product was delivered as advertised. No visible scratches, it looks new!
            "
"24","I can say it¡¯s one of the best phoneIt really look like new though no headphone but it came with charger <U+0001F50C> and it¡¯s pretty new no scratches whatsoever thanks to the seller o recommend this seller for the best phone however.....

"25","The phone didn't worked, so i had to send it back, but, tech support is the reason i give 5 stars to a not working phone. Great support!!!

"30","the product itself came perfect in the package and was unlocked so my sim worked. the package itself was shady and the cord wasn¡¯t apple product. the phone also didn¡¯t come with headphones but that wasn¡¯t necessarily too bad i jsut went out and bought some. overall the phone works fine for me, sometimes it¡¯s a bit slow but functions great and works as expected. great buy.

            "
"56","Had two weeks to return it. My original intent was to have a big screen with a phone small enough for my pocket. I read all the negative reviews. It took a few days to learn buttonless mauvering...but I learned it. Facial ID perfect. But for day to day use with no fear of back glass breaking I decided to swap the X for the 7.  But at the last moment I decided to keep the ten. It does have the largest screen yet fits in my pocket.
            "
"57","I bought a refurbished iPhone that I received on June 24, 2018. On November 3, 2018, while using the phone, I could feel the phone getting way too hot (for no reason), and then it shut itself down. I got it restarted about 30 minutes later, and then it immediately overheated again and completely died. My refurbished iPhone lasted exactly 130 days.I, of course, contacted the seller but they refused to help me or stand behind what they sold me. They basically said ¡°too bad, so sad¡± the warranty is 90 days. So, no, I do not recommend buying a refurbished iPhone, and I especially don¡¯t recommend buying one from this third-party seller (Prime Mobility).

"89","Producto NUEVO

"90","Package came with it some random box. Do note this is not from apple.For my unit, I believe the previous owner dropped it and broke the screen. I have reasons to believe my screen is not authentic. It¡¯s easily scratch.I notice small dent marks on the bottom & at the back of the phone.Battery health is 88% for mine which is sort of disappointing.Take note:-Phone is definitely used-Battery health is not within 90%-small dents-easily scratch on screen-it¡¯s probably not water resistant anymore, if they actually replaced the screen.-no original cable or adapterOverall, it works fine. But I just want to put this out there so some of you will consider it before purchasing it. For the price is honestly ok.
            "
"91","This review is for the phone, but considering how it was bought from this Amazon seller.I was a bit weary to buy, given the varying reviews. It arrived in a white, unmarked box as expected as a renewed/refurbished product. Came with an offbrand charger, but no headphones.The description said, by definition, it would have minimal to no scratches. There is one 3/8¡± to 1/2¡± scratch near the front camera on the screen that goes into the functional screen area. It¡¯s not terrible, but I would consider it a little more severe than minimal.Battery health was said to be about 80% if I remember correctly. Battery health as received was 96%, which I was happy about.Everything else, a few days in, seem to be on par with a new phone. I will update this review with any shortfalls or unanticipted failures going forward.
            "
"92","Super disappointed when I got this phone. I rarely leave reviews but when I opened this phone I was aggravated. Screen has scratches and the outside edges of the phone are dirty. This is clearly not a refurbished phone, so it should not be advertised as such. Now I have to wait for another one which is even more aggravating!
            "
"93","It is not a Refurbished iphone, it is activated
            "
"94","My iPhone X was delivered in what I believe to be near perfect condition. Very light scratch on the face of the screen, however it disappeared after installing a tempered glass screen protector. Powered on just fine and is fully compatible with my at&t SIM card. The iPhone came with 89% of it¡¯s original factory battery health which is more than advertised for this refurbished product (battery health can be found in settings). With the iPhone X I also received both an apple brand power cable and wall adapter (I got lucky). My apple AirPods and apple watch (both sold separately) paired to this devise without any issues.Overall: I received my product exactly as advertised which makes me very satisfied. Other reviewers complain about things outside of the sellers control such as the lack of a headphone jack and the new gesture controls used in place of the retired ¡°home button¡±. The learning curve felt easy and natural. Potential buyers should look into the features of the phone before buying this product new OR refurbished. 5/5 stars highly recommended.
            "
"95","Soy de Costa Rica, Compre el X de 256, la verdad estaba algo nervioso por ser reconstruido, pero lo recibo ( un dia antes de lo previsto), y considero que este es el mejor negocio que se puede hacer, la bateria esta al 100%, pantalla intacta, funciona de maravilla, es como comprarlo nuevo de Apple.
            "
"96","This IPhone X has been phenomenal. The speed at which it operates is Incredible. If you are questioning this buy, don¡¯t. It¡¯s a wonderful deal. I¡¯ve not had one issue thus far, and will most certainly update this review if I have one within the warranty period. I recommend getting a tempered glass screen and a good case<U+2014>this phone is glass front and back.
            "
"97","This is a refurbished iPhone X. The box is from Verizon company that comes with only the charger and the phone. Doesn¡¯t have a pin to eject the SIM card nor earphones. The screen is a bit scratched but that¡¯s to be expected since it¡¯s refurbished. The box also said that it¡¯s a pre owned. So the assumption is that someone turned in the phone for an upgrade. The battery health is at 99%. Today is the first day I¡¯m using it so don¡¯t really know how long the battery will last me. I ordered a screen protector so maybe that¡¯ll blocker the scratch a bit. We shall see. Overall, it¡¯s a cheap iPhone X with 256 GB. I have T-Mobile and the SIM card works. Not a bad deal at all.
            "
"98","Forget buying new phones. Just buy refurbished phones. It¡¯s better for the environment and it¡¯s a better value.

"100","This phone would not activate on the Sprint Network. Does not appear to be fully unlocked, despite what it says in the description.
            "
"101","Nice product, looks like new. Battery life is not 100%, I would say around 60... but overall, I satisfied with the purchase
            "
"102","Won't connect with my Bose wireless speakers, and won't connect with my wireless JBL speakers. Internet search shows many people have similar problems. The iPhone X has serious issues with bluetoothing. Wish I hadn't bought it. Another problem is that the music app randomly malfunctions. I click on a playlist for it to play and instead get a menu of things to do such as deleting the playlist. Why? Is some saboteur active inside Apple? I've not used anything but iPhones since the first one came out, but this sort of deliberate aggravation of customers is getting too much.
            "
"103","I am happy that I found an unlocked iPhone X. The price was decent. I can¡¯t say I¡¯m in love with it bc it¡¯s more difficult that the iPhone 6 I had. Getting used to no home button or headphone jack is a bummer.
            "
"104","I purchased this refurbished iPhone with high hopes. It looked great and the screen was in perfect condition. I soon realized that the Bluetooth did not work with all my Bluetooth devices. I could not get the phone to pair with my car or headphones. The phone also didn¡¯t work when I tried using the adapter and headphones with a cord. I returned the phone for a full refund.
            "
"105","Would give 0 stars if I could. I received the phone today and have already contacted the seller. The phone was NOT UNLOCKED like the product advertised. I have spent extra money with my career to activate it only to find it locked. For now I will wait and see. I do not recommend even spending your money with a company that cannot guarantee what it advertises.
            "
"106","I picked 2 day shipping to get it delivered 5 days later. Upon receiving I tried to power it on. To no response. I went  to charge it on the charger that was given to get the charging screen for 30 minutes. I then used my other charger for 4 hours to no results. The quality of charger and charger brick was very poor. Did not come with EarPods. I sent it back Now I hope I get my refund quickly for amazon guarantee.
            "
"107","I purchased two devices. I was unable to activate either on Sprint. I called BUY Spry and the agent told me, ""sometimes Sprint just doesn't work""I searched the IMEI on IMEI.info and found two things:One was the correct model per description - A1865. However, this phone is LOCKED to a carrier!The other device was the wrong model - A1901. This model is GSM network only.That's an epic FAIL for BuySpry, especially since they blamed Sprint. I won't buy refurbished again. These are both getting sent back.
            "
"108","Comes with very visible scratches at the front and the sides. As much as I hate to write a negative review, but I had no choice. Had ordered this for my brother on his birthday expecting it to at least have some minor scratches, but got to see it is full of scratches on the front and sides, I've bought renewed phones before but never faced a situation like this. Very dissatisfied.
            "
"109","I was very skeptical when ordering this product because of the negative reviews, but this was MORE than worth the money. Had no scratches or anything. Worst thing I found was cosmetic wear on the edges (in the picture uploaded). Battery is at 92% capacity and it works like a dream. Only minor inconvenience was having to update the phone before I could download the backup from my old phone. Came fully unlocked as promised and with an off brand charger that works fine.
            "
"110","The phone i was told by an Apple employee should of never been put on the market.  What a disaster purchase!  The phone will never work.  I now have to wait days for return instructions and a refund. What a mess!  I will never use Amazon again!
            "
"111","I was nervous to by a refurbished phone, but I¡¯m impressed so far! The only bad part is there are scratches on the screen and around the frame of the glass. I suppose that¡¯s what you get when you buy used. I instantly took it to verizon to have liquid glass installed for $50 and they noticed the scratches not me. Battery life is 100% and everything seems to be working great!
            "
"112","You can see tons of scratches when light shines on the screen. The phone I got was definitely dropped, scuffed, and just blatantly abused!The seller cleaned the screen, but failed to clean the speakers, and charger port. A brand new phone is only $100 more. I would suggest just buying a new phone.
            "
"113","Loved everything about this deal. Got a fraction of the cost of a brand new iPhone, comes with a cheaper protection plan with the same coverage as AppleCare, and it came out of the box like new with a charger. The back was has a glossy finish with 0 blemishes and the screen had VERY minor wear, pretty much brand new. Would buy from them again and again
            "
"114","Long reviews say this phone is amazing and some say it is horrible so I¡¯ll give you a quick review based on my experience and no I wasn¡¯t paid for this. When I was looking for a phone to buy the comments sketched me out and the fact that it was refurbished didn¡¯t help, but the phone came literally with no scratches, it read my chip at first try and it runs beautifully. Maybe I was lucky but I am really satisfied
            "
"115","I would not buy a renewed or refurbished phone.  I am sending this back with the 90 day guarantee.

"116","I have bought Amazon refurb products before and have never been disappointed.  I have had this phone for several months now and have had ""0"" issues and got it at a great price.

"121","The phone is as advertised. Very happy with the phone. It works as expected. Shipping was very quick
            "
"122","I bough this product last month ago, and suddenly the screen become black out. I tried to charge it again but the screen doesnt work at all. I was so dis appointed in the iPhone x that They send to me it works from the beginning but They ends like this. Wish that the next iPhone x that They Will send me is 100% in good condition.
            "
"123","I¡¯m loving it! So worth it!
            "
"124","Phone has looked and acted like NEW since day one. Was definitely a risk buying something so expensive refurbished but it absolutely worked out this time. If all the refurbished phones come like this I HIGHLY recommend taking advantage of the $400 difference from a new Iphone X 265GB.
            "
"125","If you're not an Apple fan you wouldn't like it. It does everything I expected. It will take some time to get used to the new features but I prefer them over the old.
            "
"126","I requested a silver one and got a gray one. Extremely disappointed as nobody reviewed the product and compared it with my original order
            "
"127","Came safely. No scratches at all. Was able to set up from old phone in less than an hour and have everything running smoothly. This phone is a little bit bigger than the iPhone SE I previously had and I love the feel of it so far. No glitches and the SIM card installed without a hitch. Definitely will buy again if I have the money and need it!<U+0001F602>  Batter life is at 100%.

"187","This is my favorite iPhone so far. I do think that  <U+F8FF> should be further ahead though. I¡¯ve been a bit bored with iPhones when it comes to cool gimmicky features. Powerwise, I¡¯m super satisfied! It is a work horse in your hands, all my programs open up fast with no lag. I¡¯ve also gotten this phone wet on many occasions and it¡¯s still going strong. I got it about a month after it hit stores. I don¡¯t miss the headphone jack because I only use it with Bluetooth devices. For reference, I use Bose soundlink 360 II, Bose Mini, PowerBeats 3 and Bose QuietComfort 35 II. They all connect great without a hitch. Some persons must have gotten a lemon. They should take it in to Apple, I¡¯m sure they would exchange or repair your phone if you haven¡¯t had it for more than a year.
            "
"188","Apple told me to take the phone to BestBuy for service after it developed a bunch of lines on the screen. Best Buy tried for an hour to process the return and gave up saying Apple's software wouldn't accept it for service. I went back onto Apple's chat based support. It was in the evening and the person on chat struggled with English. After much back and forth she could not explain the potential charges.
            "
"189","This phone looks, feels, and acts like it is brand new.  It came a day early than it was expected.  It arrived in a Trade Mobile packaging box with a chord and outlet to charge it.  There are no scratches or cracks on the phone.  Buying this phone was a great deal especially since it is going for a much higher price (granted I was a little skeptical).  I was able to set it up with no trouble.  The only way I can tell it is not a new phone is if I go into the iPhone settings, then general, then about, and then look at the model it says NQCL2LL/A instead of starting with an M (which means new).  After looking it up, N apparently means replacement.  So the phone I got is a replacement phone that works and looks perfectly fine.

"190","I wasted over a grand on this phone. I¡¯d had the iPhone 6 before and I wanted to upgrade because I¡¯d heard good things about the camera. I wanted to take better pictures of my kids and figured it would be easier to spend the money on a phone than a camera . Wrong. Marginally better camera. NO thumb recognition. Just annoying and terrible. So disappointed

"193","The most user UNFRIENDLY PHONE EVER PRODUCED!  If this were the only cellphone available in the world I would go back to using a CB radio or two tin cans with a string.  I despise this phone.  The voice recognition software is useless.  I tried to say ""Hey Siri, I want to book a flight to Tampa, Florida"" and it tried to pull up books about tampons in Florida.  Every time you pick the stupid thing up it takes a picture of the screen.  And speaking of screens, try sending a text message to someone....when you try to tap their name, it ends up calling them instead, when you finally do get the message screen open and you start to type into what you think is the message field, you are typing your message in the ""TO:"" field. The GPS navigation is a joke.  I do not understand people who love Apple products..  Anyone who likes this phone must enjoy being constantly frustrated with trying to do the most simple and mundane of tasks.  If you have an iPhone and you love it, you are not my friend!  That's right, we have nothing in common and I don't like you because of it.  YES, that is me judging you!  Call me superficial, call me an idiot, I don't care; I hate this phone more than anything and I don't want to be around people who like it!  I will never stray away from an Android based system again.

"202","If you're looking for hundreds of dollars off an iPhone X this is the way to do it. The phone functions perfectly, battery health states it is 96%. Screen is in like new condition.I've always purchased refurb'd products from laptops to tablets to phones. Upon receiving this device I was a little disappointed regarding the description in comparison to the product I received.""The products will have minimal to no signs of wear, no visible cosmetic imperfections when held 12 inches away""The scratch on the lens that I've included a picture of wouldn't show up very well on my iPhone 6s's camera but I couldn't get it to focus on the back glass of the iPhone X with my horrific barracks lighting. The scratch I can visibly see when the phone is resting on a table in front of me.
            "
"203","I don't think the iPhone X is a bad phone overall, I just got a bad refurbished one from Trademore Mobile. It looked brand new but the touch screen had a dead area so I was never able to even set up the phone.
            "
"204","So far the phone has been great. It came with a small but noticeable scratch on the back glass, which was expected.I was very disappointed with how it was packaged and protected in the packaging. I¡¯ve bought screen protectors that have come in a more secure package. It came in a box inside a padded envelope. When I opened the envelope my box was destroyed (which I do know isn¡¯t the fault of the seller but of bad shipping and handeling. My point is that it should¡¯ve been protected in the event that the shipping wasn¡¯t careful). It was pure luck that the phone itself wasn¡¯t broken. It just didn¡¯t give me the best feeling. I was disappointed to be honest. I wish it would¡¯ve come in a box similar to the box which iPhones originally come in, being more similar to a case than a cheap paper box.The phone itself is great so far. The wall charger and cord are off brand which was again expected. Everything works well. Other than being sent in a sketchy package overall, I¡¯m happy with the product itself. Better than I expected actually.. and that¡¯s why I¡¯m giving 4 stars.

"205","1) Works well. Worth the money. Great phone. High % battery life. Kept this phone.2) Did not work. 80% battery life. Would not connect to Verizon. I sent this phone back for a full refund.

"219","I would first like to say that I have supported apple for a long time but this phone is unreliable and not worth the money. I have held off on writing a review in hopes that this phone would improve but it continues to be crap. My first issue with this phone is it's lack of a headphone jack. Now when I purchased this phone I knew I would have to carry around an adapter and I was willing to accept that; however, I was not prepared for my phone to not play music or connect even when I had said adapter. Furthermore, it used to not continuously charge meaning I would constantly have to re-plug it in and now it refuses to charge all together. Also, it will stop playing songs or Siri will turn on (even after I disabled her) for no reason. In addition, the camera will constantly freeze when I try to zoom in which has often stopped me from taking amazing photos. All in all this phone is glitchy, not worth the money, ugly (I mean did they really think making the top dip down was a good idea?), and will ultimately annoy you to the point where you have to write a rant online and not even on the official website because apple doesn't want to hear people's opinions.
            "
"220","The iPhone X is the most exciting phone I've owned since the iPhone 3GS so many years ago. I only recently had an opportunity to get one and it looks amazing, its cameras are spectacular and its quickness can be felt everywhere. Apple knew their design would be exciting, so they skipped over number 9 and made it the ""10,"" as if to say they're showing you a window to the future, just like a concept car. But as we all know, concept cars rarely end up on the assembly line without a few changes, and with good reason. Here's why the iPhone X, for all its power and beauty, really just deserves a ""B"" for its design:1) The phone's signature looks turn anonymous inside a case.2) The phone's surfaces all scratch easily.3) It is the most slippery phone I've ever encountered.Add these things together, and you have a beautiful phone that MUST be put in an obscuring case, which makes its beauty kind of pointless. Inside a case and switched off, it doesn't even have Apple's signature circular button to identify itself. As of right now, I only have glass protectors on the front and back, but I know what will happen if I keep it like this long-term.The other new feature on the iPhone X is Face ID, or ""expensive way to avoid having a button on the front of the phone."" It works fine, but requires mild adjustments in how you use your phone and is definitely no better than Touch ID. I turned off the ""attention detection,"" meaning I don't have to be looking directly at the phone to unlock it, and now it is quick and unobtrusive.Finally, there's the ""notch."" This is a non-issue. I don't know what the fuss is about unless you're a software designer. Moving on.All in all, I've had my iPhone X for a couple months and couldn't be happier. It is not perfect, and I'll bet it'll be completely replaced by Fall 2019 (now that designer Jonny Ive is back in charge), but I'm loving everything about it. Even its flaws.
            "
"221","Switched back to iPhone from Samsung.  The biggest mistake.  I spent three hours trying to get my old iTunes password.  They say it may take a week.  Well, that was a waste of money.  Samsung was so much easier to use.  I only switched because of buy one get one and now I need to decide if the $100 restock is worth the pain.

"222","I got this item super quickly (ordered on Christmas and received that following Friday) and it has been perfect so far.

I got it out and it barely had any charge on it so I had to charge it before setup. once I got halfway threw the set up it turned black and said it was to to hot to function when it defiantly wasn't hot at all this was very disappointing. over all, after set up its a nice phone just couldn't get over the repetition of the same problem and so I had it refunded.

"247","The screen of the iPhone has a lots of scratches. I removed the screen protector that the seller had put on it and found out about the poor state of the screen.

"252","I was a bit hesitant to order this phone because I've never ordered a phone from a retailer instead of the company itself. It arrived on the date predicted and I've had it for about three weeks now. It showed up in a plain white box in a bit of a dirty envelope but the phone itself was fine, it didn't have any scratches or dents or anything. Managed to set it up with my service provider that same day. It turned up with about 20% charge, a charger, and a SIM card pin. I recommend order headphone jack adapters or lightning headphones before you get this phone, if this is your first time using an iPhone like me. All things considered, a good purchase.
            "
"253","Apple X, cant say enough. I purchase this phone used and unlocked for $850. the phone screen came fast but was blemished or scratched under screen protector. I don't really care. Good phone. Don't buy phones from bit phone companies.  They swindle you out of $1200 for long pay.

            "
"256","Bought this for my husband and have absolutely no complaints. Looks like a brand new phone. The only thing to note is that you receive a generic charger and no headphones as you would with a brand new phone. But for the price difference, its worth buying your own headphones. I liked the peace of mind having 90 days to use it to make sure it works correctly. So far it is perfect.
            "
"257","Simply amazing. Everything working perfectly, including the charger that is shipped with the phone. Couldn¡¯t be happier. Spending so much money online made me nervous of a scam, but luckily this product was delivered as advertised. No visible scratches, it looks new!
            "
"258","I can say it¡¯s one of the best phoneIt really look like new though no headphone but it came with charger <U+0001F50C> and it¡¯s pretty new no scratches whatsoever thanks to the seller o recommend this seller for the best phone however.....

"290","Had two weeks to return it. My original intent was to have a big screen with a phone small enough for my pocket. I read all the negative reviews. It took a few days to learn buttonless mauvering...but I learned it. Facial ID perfect. But for day to day use with no fear of back glass breaking I decided to swap the X for the 7.  But at the last moment I decided to keep the ten. It does have the largest screen yet fits in my pocket.
            "
"291","I bought a refurbished iPhone that I received on June 24, 2018. On November 3, 2018, while using the phone, I could feel the phone getting way too hot (for no reason), and then it shut itself down. I got it restarted about 30 minutes later, and then it immediately overheated again and completely died. My refurbished iPhone lasted exactly 130 days.I, of course, contacted the seller but they refused to help me or stand behind what they sold me. They basically said ¡°too bad, so sad¡± the warranty is 90 days. So, no, I do not recommend buying a refurbished iPhone, and I especially don¡¯t recommend buying one from this third-party seller (Prime Mobility).

"323","Producto NUEVO
            "
"324","Package came with it some random box. Do note this is not from apple.For my unit, I believe the previous owner dropped it and broke the screen. I have reasons to believe my screen is not authentic. It¡¯s easily scratch.I notice small dent marks on the bottom & at the back of the phone.Battery health is 88% for mine which is sort of disappointing.Take note:-Phone is definitely used-Battery health is not within 90%-small dents-easily scratch on screen-it¡¯s probably not water resistant anymore, if they actually replaced the screen.-no original cable or adapterOverall, it works fine. But I just want to put this out there so some of you will consider it before purchasing it. For the price is honestly ok.
            "
"325","This review is for the phone, but considering how it was bought from this Amazon seller.I was a bit weary to buy, given the varying reviews. It arrived in a white, unmarked box as expected as a renewed/refurbished product. Came with an offbrand charger, but no headphones.The description said, by definition, it would have minimal to no scratches. There is one 3/8¡± to 1/2¡± scratch near the front camera on the screen that goes into the functional screen area. It¡¯s not terrible, but I would consider it a little more severe than minimal.Battery health was said to be about 80% if I remember correctly. Battery health as received was 96%, which I was happy about.Everything else, a few days in, seem to be on par with a new phone. I will update this review with any shortfalls or unanticipted failures going forward.
            "
"326","Super disappointed when I got this phone. I rarely leave reviews but when I opened this phone I was aggravated. Screen has scratches and the outside edges of the phone are dirty. This is clearly not a refurbished phone, so it should not be advertised as such. Now I have to wait for another one which is even more aggravating!
            "
"327","It is not a Refurbished iphone, it is activated
            "
"328","My iPhone X was delivered in what I believe to be near perfect condition. Very light scratch on the face of the screen, however it disappeared after installing a tempered glass screen protector. Powered on just fine and is fully compatible with my at&t SIM card. The iPhone came with 89% of it¡¯s original factory battery health which is more than advertised for this refurbished product (battery health can be found in settings). With the iPhone X I also received both an apple brand power cable and wall adapter (I got lucky). My apple AirPods and apple watch (both sold separately) paired to this devise without any issues.Overall: I received my product exactly as advertised which makes me very satisfied. Other reviewers complain about things outside of the sellers control such as the lack of a headphone jack and the new gesture controls used in place of the retired ¡°home button¡±. The learning curve felt easy and natural. Potential buyers should look into the features of the phone before buying this product new OR refurbished. 5/5 stars highly recommended.
            "
"329","Soy de Costa Rica, Compre el X de 256, la verdad estaba algo nervioso por ser reconstruido, pero lo recibo ( un dia antes de lo previsto), y considero que este es el mejor negocio que se puede hacer, la bateria esta al 100%, pantalla intacta, funciona de maravilla, es como comprarlo nuevo de Apple.
            "
"330","This IPhone X has been phenomenal. The speed at which it operates is Incredible. If you are questioning this buy, don¡¯t. It¡¯s a wonderful deal. I¡¯ve not had one issue thus far, and will most certainly update this review if I have one within the warranty period. I recommend getting a tempered glass screen and a good case<U+2014>this phone is glass front and back.
            "
"331","This is a refurbished iPhone X. The box is from Verizon company that comes with only the charger and the phone. Doesn¡¯t have a pin to eject the SIM card nor earphones. The screen is a bit scratched but that¡¯s to be expected since it¡¯s refurbished. The box also said that it¡¯s a pre owned. So the assumption is that someone turned in the phone for an upgrade. The battery health is at 99%. Today is the first day I¡¯m using it so don¡¯t really know how long the battery will last me. I ordered a screen protector so maybe that¡¯ll blocker the scratch a bit. We shall see. Overall, it¡¯s a cheap iPhone X with 256 GB. I have T-Mobile and the SIM card works. Not a bad deal at all.
            "
"332","Forget buying new phones. Just buy refurbished phones. It¡¯s better for the environment and it¡¯s a better value.

"333","I bought this phone and this is my first picture with the back camera and also when Im tapping look like multitouch. There is any possibility to change the phone?
            "
"334","This phone would not activate on the Sprint Network. Does not appear to be fully unlocked, despite what it says in the description.
            "
"335","Nice product, looks like new. Battery life is not 100%, I would say around 60... but overall, I satisfied with the purchase
            "
"336","Won't connect with my Bose wireless speakers, and won't connect with my wireless JBL speakers. Internet search shows many people have similar problems. The iPhone X has serious issues with bluetoothing. Wish I hadn't bought it. Another problem is that the music app randomly malfunctions. I click on a playlist for it to play and instead get a menu of things to do such as deleting the playlist. Why? Is some saboteur active inside Apple? I've not used anything but iPhones since the first one came out, but this sort of deliberate aggravation of customers is getting too much.
            "
"337","I am happy that I found an unlocked iPhone X. The price was decent. I can¡¯t say I¡¯m in love with it bc it¡¯s more difficult that the iPhone 6 I had. Getting used to no home button or headphone jack is a bummer.
            "
"338","I purchased this refurbished iPhone with high hopes. It looked great and the screen was in perfect condition. I soon realized that the Bluetooth did not work with all my Bluetooth devices. I could not get the phone to pair with my car or headphones. The phone also didn¡¯t work when I tried using the adapter and headphones with a cord. I returned the phone for a full refund.
            "
"339","Would give 0 stars if I could. I received the phone today and have already contacted the seller. The phone was NOT UNLOCKED like the product advertised. I have spent extra money with my career to activate it only to find it locked. For now I will wait and see. I do not recommend even spending your money with a company that cannot guarantee what it advertises.
            "
"340","I picked 2 day shipping to get it delivered 5 days later. Upon receiving I tried to power it on. To no response. I went  to charge it on the charger that was given to get the charging screen for 30 minutes. I then used my other charger for 4 hours to no results. The quality of charger and charger brick was very poor. Did not come with EarPods. I sent it back Now I hope I get my refund quickly for amazon guarantee.
            "
"341","I purchased two devices. I was unable to activate either on Sprint. I called BUY Spry and the agent told me, ""sometimes Sprint just doesn't work""I searched the IMEI on IMEI.info and found two things:One was the correct model per description - A1865. However, this phone is LOCKED to a carrier!The other device was the wrong model - A1901. This model is GSM network only.That's an epic FAIL for BuySpry, especially since they blamed Sprint. I won't buy refurbished again. These are both getting sent back.
            "
"342","Comes with very visible scratches at the front and the sides. As much as I hate to write a negative review, but I had no choice. Had ordered this for my brother on his birthday expecting it to at least have some minor scratches, but got to see it is full of scratches on the front and sides, I've bought renewed phones before but never faced a situation like this. Very dissatisfied.
            "
"343","I was very skeptical when ordering this product because of the negative reviews, but this was MORE than worth the money. Had no scratches or anything. Worst thing I found was cosmetic wear on the edges (in the picture uploaded). Battery is at 92% capacity and it works like a dream. Only minor inconvenience was having to update the phone before I could download the backup from my old phone. Came fully unlocked as promised and with an off brand charger that works fine.
            "
"344","The phone i was told by an Apple employee should of never been put on the market.  What a disaster purchase!  The phone will never work.  I now have to wait days for return instructions and a refund. What a mess!  I will never use Amazon again!
            "
"345","I was nervous to by a refurbished phone, but I¡¯m impressed so far! The only bad part is there are scratches on the screen and around the frame of the glass. I suppose that¡¯s what you get when you buy used. I instantly took it to verizon to have liquid glass installed for $50 and they noticed the scratches not me. Battery life is 100% and everything seems to be working great!
            "
"346","You can see tons of scratches when light shines on the screen. The phone I got was definitely dropped, scuffed, and just blatantly abused!The seller cleaned the screen, but failed to clean the speakers, and charger port. A brand new phone is only $100 more. I would suggest just buying a new phone.
            "
"347","Loved everything about this deal. Got a fraction of the cost of a brand new iPhone, comes with a cheaper protection plan with the same coverage as AppleCare, and it came out of the box like new with a charger. The back was has a glossy finish with 0 blemishes and the screen had VERY minor wear, pretty much brand new. Would buy from them again and again
            "
"348","Long reviews say this phone is amazing and some say it is horrible so I¡¯ll give you a quick review based on my experience and no I wasn¡¯t paid for this. When I was looking for a phone to buy the comments sketched me out and the fact that it was refurbished didn¡¯t help, but the phone came literally with no scratches, it read my chip at first try and it runs beautifully. Maybe I was lucky but I am really satisfied
            "
"349","I would not buy a renewed or refurbished phone.  I am sending this back with the 90 day guarantee.

"355","The phone is as advertised. Very happy with the phone. It works as expected. Shipping was very quick
            "
"356","I bough this product last month ago, and suddenly the screen become black out. I tried to charge it again but the screen doesnt work at all. I was so dis appointed in the iPhone x that They send to me it works from the beginning but They ends like this. Wish that the next iPhone x that They Will send me is 100% in good condition.
            "
"357","I¡¯m loving it! So worth it!
            "
"358","Phone has looked and acted like NEW since day one. Was definitely a risk buying something so expensive refurbished but it absolutely worked out this time. If all the refurbished phones come like this I HIGHLY recommend taking advantage of the $400 difference from a new Iphone X 265GB.
            "
"359","If you're not an Apple fan you wouldn't like it. It does everything I expected. It will take some time to get used to the new features but I prefer them over the old.

"360","I requested a silver one and got a gray one. Extremely disappointed as nobody reviewed the product and compared it with my original order
            "
"361","Came safely. No scratches at all. Was able to set up from old phone in less than an hour and have everything running smoothly. This phone is a little bit bigger than the iPhone SE I previously had and I love the feel of it so far. No glitches and the SIM card installed without a hitch. Definitely will buy again if I have the money and need it!<U+0001F602>  Batter life is at 100%.

"421","This is my favorite iPhone so far. I do think that  <U+F8FF> should be further ahead though. I¡¯ve been a bit bored with iPhones when it comes to cool gimmicky features. Powerwise, I¡¯m super satisfied! It is a work horse in your hands, all my programs open up fast with no lag. I¡¯ve also gotten this phone wet on many occasions and it¡¯s still going strong. I got it about a month after it hit stores. I don¡¯t miss the headphone jack because I only use it with Bluetooth devices. For reference, I use Bose soundlink 360 II, Bose Mini, PowerBeats 3 and Bose QuietComfort 35 II. They all connect great without a hitch. Some persons must have gotten a lemon. They should take it in to Apple, I¡¯m sure they would exchange or repair your phone if you haven¡¯t had it for more than a year.
            "
"422","Apple told me to take the phone to BestBuy for service after it developed a bunch of lines on the screen. Best Buy tried for an hour to process the return and gave up saying Apple's software wouldn't accept it for service. I went back onto Apple's chat based support. It was in the evening and the person on chat struggled with English. After much back and forth she could not explain the potential charges.
            "
"423","This phone looks, feels, and acts like it is brand new.  It came a day early than it was expected.  It arrived in a Trade Mobile packaging box with a chord and outlet to charge it.  There are no scratches or cracks on the phone.  Buying this phone was a great deal especially since it is going for a much higher price (granted I was a little skeptical).  I was able to set it up with no trouble.  The only way I can tell it is not a new phone is if I go into the iPhone settings, then general, then about, and then look at the model it says NQCL2LL/A instead of starting with an M (which means new).  After looking it up, N apparently means replacement.  So the phone I got is a replacement phone that works and looks perfectly fine.
            "
"424","I wasted over a grand on this phone. I¡¯d had the iPhone 6 before and I wanted to upgrade because I¡¯d heard good things about the camera. I wanted to take better pictures of my kids and figured it would be easier to spend the money on a phone than a camera . Wrong. Marginally better camera. NO thumb recognition. Just annoying and terrible. So disappointed

"427","The most user UNFRIENDLY PHONE EVER PRODUCED!  If this were the only cellphone available in the world I would go back to using a CB radio or two tin cans with a string.  I despise this phone.  The voice recognition software is useless.  I tried to say ""Hey Siri, I want to book a flight to Tampa, Florida"" and it tried to pull up books about tampons in Florida.  Every time you pick the stupid thing up it takes a picture of the screen.  And speaking of screens, try sending a text message to someone....when you try to tap their name, it ends up calling them instead, when you finally do get the message screen open and you start to type into what you think is the message field, you are typing your message in the ""TO:"" field. The GPS navigation is a joke.  I do not understand people who love Apple products..  Anyone who likes this phone must enjoy being constantly frustrated with trying to do the most simple and mundane of tasks.  If you have an iPhone and you love it, you are not my friend!  That's right, we have nothing in common and I don't like you because of it.  YES, that is me judging you!  Call me superficial, call me an idiot, I don't care; I hate this phone more than anything and I don't want to be around people who like it!  I will never stray away from an Android based system again.

"436","If you're looking for hundreds of dollars off an iPhone X this is the way to do it. The phone functions perfectly, battery health states it is 96%. Screen is in like new condition.I've always purchased refurb'd products from laptops to tablets to phones. Upon receiving this device I was a little disappointed regarding the description in comparison to the product I received.""The products will have minimal to no signs of wear, no visible cosmetic imperfections when held 12 inches away""The scratch on the lens that I've included a picture of wouldn't show up very well on my iPhone 6s's camera but I couldn't get it to focus on the back glass of the iPhone X with my horrific barracks lighting. The scratch I can visibly see when the phone is resting on a table in front of me.
            "
"437","I don't think the iPhone X is a bad phone overall, I just got a bad refurbished one from Trademore Mobile. It looked brand new but the touch screen had a dead area so I was never able to even set up the phone.
            "
"438","So far the phone has been great. It came with a small but noticeable scratch on the back glass, which was expected.I was very disappointed with how it was packaged and protected in the packaging. I¡¯ve bought screen protectors that have come in a more secure package. It came in a box inside a padded envelope. When I opened the envelope my box was destroyed (which I do know isn¡¯t the fault of the seller but of bad shipping and handeling. My point is that it should¡¯ve been protected in the event that the shipping wasn¡¯t careful). It was pure luck that the phone itself wasn¡¯t broken. It just didn¡¯t give me the best feeling. I was disappointed to be honest. I wish it would¡¯ve come in a box similar to the box which iPhones originally come in, being more similar to a case than a cheap paper box.The phone itself is great so far. The wall charger and cord are off brand which was again expected. Everything works well. Other than being sent in a sketchy package overall, I¡¯m happy with the product itself. Better than I expected actually.. and that¡¯s why I¡¯m giving 4 stars.

"439","1) Works well. Worth the money. Great phone. High % battery life. Kept this phone.2) Did not work. 80% battery life. Would not connect to Verizon. I sent this phone back for a full refund. The phone looked good and was functional in every way except the most important way... it could not make calls or use data, since it was unable to connect to any cellular network.

"440","Tenia dudas pero llego al segundo dia, al abrir la caja que no era original me asuste pero al ver el telefono paso a segundo plano en la caja habia solo el telefono, el cubo y un cable no hubo audifonos como decia la publicacion al prender el telefono me pidio conectar el cargador pues estaba bateria baja al conectar duro al menos unos 30 minutos para lograr el 80% de carga al prender lo primero que revise fue la capacidad de la bateria y al indicador mostro 93% de efectividad mas de lo esperado, en lo fisico el telefono esta flamante no tiene ni un rayon es sorprendente ya que en la publicacion decia que puede tener rayones o algo similar pero esta perfecto al colocar el chip funciona perfecto el FACE ID funciona perfecto

"453","I would first like to say that I have supported apple for a long time but this phone is unreliable and not worth the money. I have held off on writing a review in hopes that this phone would improve but it continues to be crap. My first issue with this phone is it's lack of a headphone jack. Now when I purchased this phone I knew I would have to carry around an adapter and I was willing to accept that; however, I was not prepared for my phone to not play music or connect even when I had said adapter. Furthermore, it used to not continuously charge meaning I would constantly have to re-plug it in and now it refuses to charge all together. Also, it will stop playing songs or Siri will turn on (even after I disabled her) for no reason. In addition, the camera will constantly freeze when I try to zoom in which has often stopped me from taking amazing photos. All in all this phone is glitchy, not worth the money, ugly (I mean did they really think making the top dip down was a good idea?), and will ultimately annoy you to the point where you have to write a rant online and not even on the official website because apple doesn't want to hear people's opinions.
            "
"454","The iPhone X is the most exciting phone I've owned since the iPhone 3GS so many years ago. I only recently had an opportunity to get one and it looks amazing, its cameras are spectacular and its quickness can be felt everywhere. Apple knew their design would be exciting, so they skipped over number 9 and made it the ""10,"" as if to say they're showing you a window to the future, just like a concept car. But as we all know, concept cars rarely end up on the assembly line without a few changes, and with good reason. Here's why the iPhone X, for all its power and beauty, really just deserves a ""B"" for its design:1) The phone's signature looks turn anonymous inside a case.2) The phone's surfaces all scratch easily.3) It is the most slippery phone I've ever encountered.Add these things together, and you have a beautiful phone that MUST be put in an obscuring case, which makes its beauty kind of pointless. Inside a case and switched off, it doesn't even have Apple's signature circular button to identify itself. As of right now, I only have glass protectors on the front and back, but I know what will happen if I keep it like this long-term.The other new feature on the iPhone X is Face ID, or ""expensive way to avoid having a button on the front of the phone."" It works fine, but requires mild adjustments in how you use your phone and is definitely no better than Touch ID. I turned off the ""attention detection,"" meaning I don't have to be looking directly at the phone to unlock it, and now it is quick and unobtrusive.Finally, there's the ""notch."" This is a non-issue. I don't know what the fuss is about unless you're a software designer. Moving on.All in all, I've had my iPhone X for a couple months and couldn't be happier. It is not perfect, and I'll bet it'll be completely replaced by Fall 2019 (now that designer Jonny Ive is back in charge), but I'm loving everything about it. Even its flaws.

"455","Switched back to iPhone from Samsung.  The biggest mistake.  I spent three hours trying to get my old iTunes password.  They say it may take a week.  Well, that was a waste of money.  Samsung was so much easier to use.  I only switched because of buy one get one and now I need to decide if the $100 restock is worth the pain.

"456","I got this item super quickly (ordered on Christmas and received that following Friday) and it has been perfect so far. Was very easy to set up the phone to my phone company (Verizon) and has all of the amazing features. Works exactly like a new phone. haven't had any technical difficulties with the phone thus far. Would highly recommend buying this item.
