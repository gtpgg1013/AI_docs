"3","I bought this phone in July 2016.  As of this past week, it has stopped working altogether.  I contacted the seller for assistance, and because more than 90 days had past - there was nothing they could do.  I tried working with Apple to troubleshoot to no avail.  I'm not even able to restore the phone to factory defaults using iTunes because of the error messages.  Right now, the phone won't even turn on.  At the time I purchased the phone, it was listed as a ""certified refurbished"" product.  After paying nearly $400, I would like to think that the phone should last at least a few years.  I just purchased a brand new iPhone directly from an AT&T store and hope for better luck.  I will never trust ""certified refurbished"" again.

"6","Like many have already written, you take a risk with refurbished. I've never had an issue before, but this is the first time an iPhone has given me issues. Right after the warranty ended, the iOS starting causing problems. The phone randomly opens apps and periodically shuts itself off.The battery is the biggest issue. It needs to be charges 3 or 4 times a day. I literally walk around with a powerbank to keep it from dying. It will lose 50-70% of the battery within 30 minutes. It does charge quickly but it dies just as fast.Cosmetically the phone was perfect. No dents or scratches, but the battery issue is extremely frustrating.

"7","Purchased phone.  Took to both Apple and AT&T. Something is wrong with phone.  Called twice about the issue , got voice mail each time. Hours say 10:30- 4:30 Mon-Fri. Still no response.  Absolutely horrible.  Buyer beware !!!

"8","I like apple. I like text replacement and certain apps I am able to get. I DO NOT like receiving a phone I paid so much for that DOESNT EVEN WORK AS A PHONE. I didn¡¯t order an iPod Touch. I ordered a phone. The caller cannot hear the recipient and the recipient cannot hear the caller. The touch screen is faulty where you have to keep touching to make something work. It will only stay connected to metro for a short time and so if I go anywhere other than home this little box is useless. To top it all off I work off my phone, and I¡¯m losing time because of your carelessness.  I¡¯ve never had trouble with phones from Groupon. Don¡¯t put a ¡°certified refurbished ¡° ticket in boxes if you have not tested the product personally. I¡¯ve never been so mad. I love amazon but you can probably guess you won¡¯t be receiving $13 a month from me anymore.The man I spoke to last night barely spoke English, didn¡¯t are about customer service, but um hi, without us customers y¡¯all would not be getting paid. You should consider treating us better with care and products that work.

"9","Honestly, I'm pretty satisfied with this product. Despite the negative reviews, I took a risk and found myself in a happy place. My phone came safely. There were no visible scratches or whatsoever on the phone. The only disappointment here is that the phone I received was a China model, therefore, my phone had camera shuttering sounds even when the ringer was turned off. Overall, I'm have no regrets on this purchase.

"10","This POS phone had a broken Wi-Fi antenna. I set it up before I left the US but didn't realize that the Wi-Fi only connected because I was in the same room as the router. I put it back in the box and into my luggage. When I got back to Vietnam and gave it to my girlfriend, she had problems connecting to Wi-Fi almost immediately. After a month of hearing about it, we took the phone to an Apple-authorized repair facility where they told us that the case had been almost imperceptibly bent and the Wi-Fi antenna broken. I cannot return it because I'm still in Vietnam--it's sitting in a drawer where it will stay until we need to scavenge it for parts. If the vendor is really certified to refurbish, they should have known the Wi-Fi antenna was broken.
            "
"11","<U+00A0>I received the phone while I was not home. As soon as I got the chance I opened the box and just by looking at the phone it was severely dented, scratched (not only signs of wear, but actual words scratched on the back of the phone), the front screen was the only thing that seemed to be replaced. The rest of the phone was in such bad shape, it was almost broken. On top of that, the phone when I connected it, didn¡¯t even work. Do not buy, save your money.

"12","I bought a phone last week and it was perfect but I lost it so I bought another but this one dies all the time. Like it just shuts off at 70% I want to exchange it for a WORKING PHONE !

"13","The phone came in a very secure box and a charger but it's not apple, had no problem setting it up to metro pcs. The reason why I have it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it did not have headphones and not an apple charger

"14","Tried to insert SIM card to use phone and it would not connect to the cell network for T-Mobile. Took the phone into 2 different T-Mobile stores and called the T-Mobile customer service line to troubleshoot. When I called the T-Mobile they said the IMEI number was incorrect for the phone, which I thought was just because she had heard it wrong. Then after visiting the second T-Mobile store to look at other phones and troubleshoot my current phone the T-Mobile associate informed me the phone was probably a fake due to the appearance of the phone. Phone stickers said Verizon network when it was received as well with a big black dot sticker trying to cover that up. BEWARE OF FAKE IPHONES BEING SOLD HERE!!!

"16","Best price compared to any other seller that I would trust. Not a fan of used electronics but considering it¡¯s an older generation I needed, it had to be used. This was a great product! Battery life is never good on an iPhone to begin with so I was impressed that is maintained 85% capacity. I would suggest buying a case immediately because this phone is rounded off on the edges so it is very slippery and very fragile. Over all satisfied with the seller and thankful that it came with a charger.

"17","Not even 6 months after the phone was bought the battery started losing charge rapidly. The phone didn¡¯t come with an original iPhone charger so I borrowed one to charge the phone. It charged super fast (as compared to the hours it took on the other charger) However the battery started swelling, pushed open the screen and started smoking inside of the phone. It burned part of the board and screen and I¡¯m now completely out of a phone

"19","The phone came in 8 hours early and caught me by surprise. I bought the Rose Gold one with 64 gigabytes of space. Don't listen to the negative reviews the phone was new and unlocked just how I wanted it. It came in a small box protected with plastic and came with a charger, but I was kinda sad I didn't get the apple earbuds tho lmao. The battery is somewhat ok but goes out fast so I plan to buy a new one but besides that the phone is fine. I have Cricket as my provider and I put in the sim card and it works with no problems. I've had the phone for almost 2 months now and just waited just in case I had any problems but everything was fine. I would recommend buying it if you want the aux cord which was the only reason why I bought it in the first place (I'll add pictures later just lazy rn lol).Apple iPhone 6, GSM Unlocked, 64GB - Gold (Certified Refurbished)

"20","I was wanting to switch from an android to an iPhone because I have a Mac and an iPad. I bought this refurbished phone from Amazon. knowing I could return it if there were any flaws. The phone arrived in perfect condition. It looks brand new, it works fantastic. I¡¯ve had it for a few weeks. My only complaint is the battery will not make it through the day. And I am not on my phone all the time so that is frustrating.  With my android I would usually have 25% at least by the end of the day before plugged it in for the night.  I have changed several settings on my phone trying to extend the battery life. But I¡¯m not sure that it¡¯s a problem with the battery as it is just a problem in general with iPhone.  It says that my battery health is good and operating at 100%. So I don¡¯t think it¡¯s a faulty battery. I keep it in low power mode all the time and constantly close out apps that are open. Other than that, I love this iPhone. I¡¯ve ended up buying a spare portable battery for $10.

"23","My phone has gone, just after 2 months of use. The first month was pretty good, the machine was hotter than usual but still good. From the second month, the bad thing happened to the battery and the power, the touch was not good and the screen was open. After buying a week, I left the US for a long vacation and could not do more than see my phone dying. Actually, In fact can not live even 60 days.I thought the battery was problematic. After returning to the US, I went to Apple Store yesterday and they checked it. The technician told me that it was not the battery problem, the battery was still working fine, but hardware have a big deal, the cost to fix it $299 + Tax (Equivalent to the amount I bought this phone!). Now it's just like a paperweight, no more.The first time I bought a refurbished phone is also the last one. Thank you!

"25","I received this product on October 13 and I paid for express shipping because I needed the item immediately. When I received the item the screen was cracked horribly but I really needed the phone so I overlooked it and thought I could just go get the screen replaced in the future. I then put in my sim card and the phone wouldn't accept the sim card it kept saying no service and that the carrier settings had to be updated I attempted to update the settings multiple times and it wouldn't. I then had to go buy a whole new sim card and that one didn't work either. Then after a few days the sound and vibrate on the phone stopped working. The battery on the phone never was good it would die at random times and quickly it then stopped charging. Which was when I finally decided to turn the phone in. I had the worst expirience with this phone and I will never buy from this company.

"26","I bought the iPhone 6 refurbished from the vendor DealFisher on Amazon in December, 2017.  The phone worked pretty good, sometimes the sound on phone calls wasn't great.  My family member who used the phone started noticing a white residue on the edges of the screen of the phone, but never paid much mind to it.  DealFisher, the vendor, offered a 90 day warranty period.  So about 110 days after I purchased the phone, the phone started losing the wireless signal.  The phone could not make or receive phone calls.  This problem was intermittent.  It would work a few hours, then it would return to ""searching"" status.  I worked with Apple telephone support, they did all they could over the phone but the problem still persisted.  I brought the phone to shop for repairs, and when the technician opened the phone, we all saw that THE INSIDE OF THE PHONE WAS CORRODED WITH OFF-WHITE PAINT!!!!  I am quite certain that no one in my family who handled the phone dropped it in a can of paint! While in my possession the phone was protected in an Otter Box and the Otter Box has not one trace of paint.  This damage existed prior to my purchasing the phone.  I contacted the vendor, who told me that my warranted had expired.  That was it, no offer to speak with anyone.

"27","Buying this phone was an interesting experience! Bottom line is, phone was in good condition but with original battery aka shot. Got a discount on purchase from Amazon because of it. Went to Apple store to purchase new battery (special for $29 on that phone til December). They made the switch and... phone never turned back on! Apple considered it their fault so phone was replaced for free with same model (new). Got a new phone in the end for a very good price... just wasn¡¯t the one sold here.

"28","The phone was not appropriate.  It took several tries and many hours to get it to a full change with it then loosing that finally established charge almost instantly.  I dare say that I could have just replaced the battery.  However, in checking with AT&T I was able to get a new, comparable phone for $50 more than this used one.  So..... I am returning this phone rather than spending more money and then hoping it would work properly.

"29","I purchased the ""certified"" refurbished iPhone 6 from this seller on June 29th which continued to have random touch screen and battery heating issues, but only intermittently which  I ignored for a while. Now it went completely bad, touch screen wouldn't work and depletes the battery.When a phone repair shop opened it, found a clearly visible previous water damage and some rust inside.. It wasn't worth getting it repaired, just got another phone since can't return it after almost 4.5 months.

"30","Phone arrived in time. It looks like new, only 2 tiny scratches on the back that were no problem to me. It came dead and i connected it to the generic charger that came with it, took too long to charge and when i took it to my carrier that is metro pcs, they couldn't activated cause it was locked. Im very dissapointed since it says in the description that its gsm unlocked and it clearly isn't. Im sending it back

"33","Ok, so where do I start!? I got a phone and it messed up so I sent it right back! NO PROBLEMS Customer service was absolutely amazing.

I will definitely update this review as we go. One thing is for sure their customer service is outstanding hopefully that don¡¯t change when I go back complaining about this one also. I will even send them videos and pictures of what it is doing ...

"34","What I Like most: it's not an Android (which was awful!). It's the whole reason I got an IPhone after putting up with the Android (Motorola, purchased new) for several years. Still getting used to the differences. Seems to operate much more smoothly, with less hiccups. Battery life is much better, lasting now almost a week without recharge and still at 46%. You wouldn't know it's a refurbished device. My Android's battery was garbage from the get-go (would sometimes plummet from 70% to 10% in 10 minutes while the device was sitting idle) and Motorola refused to help, even during the warranty period. App organization on the IPhone seems to be more intuitive and easier to navigate. Also, I don't get 2, 3 or even 4 copies of the same text message (AT&T). The only thing I miss about my prior phone is the IPhone doesn't appear to have the little flashing light on the frame which tells you that something new has happened (missed call, text message), a scheduled event needs attention, etc. I value this because when I'm at home my mobile is unattended.

"36","Bought new and a week later it was having problems finding a signal.  I went on the Apple forums to find a solution, and I found a temporary one.  Now 2 weeks later I'm having the signal search issue again and using the temporary fix.  But I don't want to keep using the temporary fix because who knows what else I am doing to the phone.  I will probably return it and get a 6S.

"37","I purchased a certified refurbished iPhone 6 for a Christmas present.  When it arrived, I had the data from my father's old iPhone transferred to the new phone (which takes time), got his apps set up, etc.  The phone was dying on a full charge within 30 minutes.  I contacted Apple Care to see if they could diagnose the problem.  They ran diagnostics and said that the phone needed a new battery.  This was supposed to come with a new battery among other things to make the phone ""certified refurbished"".  I contacted the company and asked them to either pay for a new battery by refunding me the cost of the battery or to send me a new phone (charge me for it) and then I would send the faulty one back so that he wouldn't be without a phone.  They did not accept either solution and told me just to send the phone back.  They would not work with me.  I contacted them again and never heard back.  Do not give your business to this company.  You will get a phone that looks good on the outside, but faulty on the inside.  Save your money.

"38","When the phone arrived the language hadn't been reset from french so navigating through the phone to get that reset was a pain. After I had managed to reset he phone I gave it to my grandmother. Several days later she contacted me saying that during phone calls she wan't able to hear the person on the other end of the line. My first thought was that she had something switched off but to my surprise the phone had a software issue. The microphone on the phone worked in videos and voice memos but when it came to phone calls no sound was picked up. I updated the OS, flipped through all the setting, and even tried factory resetting it again but nothing worked.The return was pretty easy and painless though, it was probably just a fluke.

"40","Do not buy these phones, they are locked on Japan networks although it's advertised otherwise. When my phone updated, the Tmobile sim card was no longer recognized. I went to the apple store to try to fix but sadly they couldn't do anything. They also let me know multiple customers have come in about the same issues and all were Amazon purchases. You might luck out with an American phone but if you buy these, make sure the FIRST thing you do is check. Easiest way, put it on silent and see if the camera still makes a sound when taking a photo. It's a law in Japan the camera sound can't be turned off.
            "
"41","This phone is in excellent condition and works perfectly.  The only issue was some minor scuffs on the sides of the phone.  I wouldn't have thought much about it, if the phone hadn't been listed as like new.  Other than that it's perfect.  This phone can definitely be found for cheaper, but I felt confident buying this with the 3 month warranty.  It being certified by Amazon also gave me some peace of mind
            "
"42","I thought  I was getting a good deal, but it seems like you get what you pay for. As soon as I transferred my data from my old phone, this one started to glitch and the finger print didn't work and it was slow to respond and it would freeze randomly. How could that happen, especially if I went from a 32GB phone to a 64GB? Unimpressed
            "
"43","First of all the phone was a gift, upon activating the phone I noticed there was a delay with the screen sensor which I figured would get better but only got worse as time progressed. Now in order to get the sensor pad to work I have to use the side screen button to turn off screen and go back to try again. When I receive a call most of the time I cannot answer it because the sensor will not work so I have to hit the side button to cancel the call and call back after waiting for the screen to work. The phone never had water damage nor have I dropped it since receiving it. I did all the normal troubleshooting of hard-resetting and setting back to factory settings but the main issue is that it had this malfunction since day one! This company will not answer your calls or return emails either.

I plugged it in for 4 hours and never charged. I took it to apple and got the battery replaced. Works great now but a battery is $49.  So when buying these refurbished phones, figure to add another $50 on the cost cuz the batteries do die, especially the original ones in the iPhone 6

"50","I ordered the phone as a gift and when I received it seemed fine. As I started to set the phone up and check out apps, I noticed the memory was showing as 75% full, although there were only the standard apps on the phone. When I used the GPS to make sure it was calibrated, it would give the proper turn directions but the map was incorrect and showed a different area of the country. After, I noticed that the apps were jumping from one app to the other without any interference.It became frustrating and I decided to return. More than likely this phone was water damaged and the vendor tried to fix it up could not. Should not be considered refurbished but rather damaged.
            "
"51","The phone looked beautiful when it came. It already had a screen protector on and was scratchless. I quickly found, however, that using wifi, data, or calls reduced the battery by 1% or more per minute. Thinking that was excessive, I installed a battery health application on the phone. The battery design capacity is at 50% (which means 50% of its capacity relative to when it was new) and the wear level is at 49% (""Very High""). According to Apple technical specifications, batteries should be replaced when they're under 80% capacity, which means that for all intents and purposes, it's a dud battery. The screen also displays early symptoms of the dreaded iphone 6 ""touch disease"": the screen often becomes unresponsive to direction. It's hard to complete more than a single text sentence without the screen becoming unresponsive. Overall, the iphone 6 was buggy to begin with, but the factory refurbishing process should have caught the battery problem at the least, and the touch screen problem if done scrupulously.
            "
"52","I ordered the refurbished iPhone 6 originally, and within 2 weeks it had completely stopped working - not charging or turning on. Also the front microphone and camera didn't work. Gave BREED the benefit of the doubt, returned it and ordered a second one, only for the exact same thing to happen all over again. Took the phone to the Apple Store and they said cheap knock off parts that break easily had been used to refurbish the phone. Definitely won't be ordering from BREED again! If you're looking at buying this phone - don't bother - spend the little bit extra to buy direct from Apple. They sell refurbished iPhones 7 onwards on their website.
            "
"53","Although the phone was in perfect physical shape, it was a Japanese model (which I was not informed of nor was it posted anywhere) so the ""shutter"" sound when taking a picture was unable to be muted, turned off, or lowered!!! Unbelievable!!!! Even on photo taking apps such as Snapchat the sound still was present AND LOUD!! Had to drive all the way to the nearest Apple Store an hour away just to find out they couldn't do anything about it!! I wasted my own time and money driving around and making sacrifices for this phone to not work as advertised. Do not buy. Buy somewhere else and make sure it is a US model. Having the shutter sound go off may not be a deal breaker but trying to take pictures or videos in silence or public just isn't for me and is disrupting. Furious. Will be buying somewhere else as I have gone back to my old phone which luckily, I still had. Time and money wasted as well as patience and trust

"54","This is probably the worst refurbished phone I¡¯ve ever bought. I was so disappointed. First, the phone that came wasn¡¯t space gray, it was gold. After about a month, the phone started dying on 50 %, a week later, dies on 90%, now the phone can be on 100% and dies within minutes of it¡¯s not plugged up. I went to a repair shop and they told me that the phone had previous water damage and the battery works fine but because of the water damage the phone had before it was refurbished, circuits are causing the battery to run dead. So now I have a bulky battery case on the phone until I Can buy a new one. Also my Touch ID won¡¯t work, and my flashlight doesn¡¯t work. I¡¯ll never buy a used phone again.

Then, once we tried to use it,  after like a month it would only work if plugged in and now it won't turn on at all after only 4 months. Took it to the Apple store and they tried two batteries, nothing would work. I tried to get a refund from this seller but they didn't ask for more details just declined due to being past the return date. Very disappointed and out $260...
            "
"59","Never buy a new phone again. The iPhone came on time and looks brand new on the front and back with little scratches on the left near the volume buttons, but idgaf I still recommend. The camera is crystal clear too. Fmoig @famouscapI bought the space grey iPhone if wanted to know.
            "
"60","After about a month the touchscreen started to act up. After two, I started having to hard-reset several times a day, due to touchscreen not responding, or the phone going nuts and opening apps, closing them, calling people, etc, like someone was tapping all over the phone super fast. I¡¯m 4 months in, and am finally at the point, even as much as I hate shopping and spending money, I am done with this phone. I will NEVER buy refurbished again.
            "
"61","Reading these other reviews I was a bit hesitant to buy, but in the end I'm very happy with my purchase. It works with my carrier and is in perfect condition. Its an actual Iphone and I have a 90 day warranty so if anything goes wrong with the phone I am covered. It runs smoothly and I haven't had any issued with the product in any way shape or form. It's a great purchase and you get what you pay for.
            "
"62","This is the worst experience I have had with amazon so far. When I received the product it looked great! I turned it on and I went through the setup and it was great!... for a week. After a week the phone just shut off and we even took it to the Apple store and even they can¡¯t fix it. Please don¡¯t buy this!
            "
"63","Hey, I received the iPhone, but it¡¯s not taking charge.As I see in 2 hours it¡¯s only 1% charge.It¡¯s really bad , I want to return it back now.Send my money back ASAP.
            "
"64","The phone itself was nice, but slightly bent. My carrier is Straight Talk and I purchased a SIM card for this phone. Service worked for about an hour total and then the phone would read ""searching"" or ""no service"" in the upper left corner. I purchased three new SIM cards. I spent hours trying to resolve this issue with Straight Talk customer service and they were as helpful as could be but at the end of the day, it was a problem with the phone not reading the SIM card. The SIM card jack looked slightly bent, this may have been the contributing factor. Either way, I would warn to not buy this if you use straight talk. I went to Walmart and bought an iphone that was already set up through straight talk and it has been working fine.
            "
"65","Packaged extremely well and everything looks/works as new
            "
"66","We bought two of these phones in a short timeframe and had an excellent seller and a horrible one. Watch which seller you are getting the product from - VIP Outlet provided a quality product that has worked from Day 1. BREED .... not so much. My daughter's phone battery needs service just 5 months after purchase. I contacted Breed for assistance, because the description states the refurb phone comes with a 1 year limited warranty. Breed says they only provide 30 days of warranty after purchase and won't give me a straight answer about anything beyond that. They are answering the question because Amazon requires it, but they aren't actually providing any useful information.This is a great deal on a great phone, but you are on your own for service.
            "
"67","This phone was great until it was unable to accept updates. I tried all methods given. Then once it wouldn't update, less than 6 months after getting it, it started acting weird. The screen will come on and go off, like a slow flash continuously at random times. There's ghost touch on the screen or totally unrepsonsive. It also refused to connect to Wi-Fi sometimes. And the worst is having battery life and the phone,at random, powers off on its own. There's no warranty on it even though it's certified refurbished. This was a good phone for a short while. But not worth the money.
            "
"68","I was happy to receive a brand new iPhone looking very much like it should when new.. I plugged in the charger and saw a red 'hourglass' icon saying that the battery needed to be charged. I charged it for 24 hours (checking on it every few hours). The battery never charged and now i just finished printing the return labels so that I can ship it back and hopefully receive a refund with no hassle.
            "
"69","First off, be careful what seller you purchase from.  I first ordered from Kanga and they were terrible on every level.  The volume didn't work properly, the battery was trash, and they delivered later than was promised.  I returned that phone and ordered another from DealFisher.  The phone is fine but the battery is equally as trashy as the previous phone.  I'm so disappointed but I've given up finding a decent battery.  I'll just pay another $80 and get a new one.
            "
"70","Phone would not take charge or even turn on. Shell was dented and scratched. Screen was not flush and slightly popping out and didn¡¯t look like an genuine apple part. The phone came with a card that said if your phone is broken or does not work please call this number. I called it an it went straight to voicemail multiple times and no one called back. The charger that came with it is not a apple charger. When you look at the positive reviews they all look like fake reviews.
            "
"71","Phone was junk. Stuff didn't work
            "
"72","The phone didn't work. Wouldn't even start up or charge. I tried 3 different chargers including the one that was sent to me. Still did not work so I took it to an Apple store because I didn't want to give up on the phone that easily and they confirmed that the phone does not work. They couldn't even turn the device on. Such an inconvenience because I really needed the phone hence why I did 2 day shipping.
            "
"73","I ordered it without looking at the reviews, so when I happen to check them later I almost lost it. The phone looks perfectly new, it did not come in the retail box however. I will update this review if the phone turns into poop.
            "
"74","I am very upset, i purchased this phone for my niece in Sept. on Dec 8th for her birthday I gave it to her and activated it with a phone chip, now a month and 6 days later for no reason it has stopped working!!! I did not fall, get wet or anything. I has always been in a very protective case.Is there a warranty???
            "
"75","I got it on estimated time, the phone came with not original charger battery and headphones. I am not sure but I believe the Iphone didn't come with its original screen despite I like too much my new Iphone 6.
            "
"76","Not working
            "
"77","I know some of these reviews made me nervous to purchase this phone and some seemed a bit shady, but overall I was very happy with the phone I got. Notice that when you change color, however, the 3rd party organization also changes. I got my phone from MyWit and it arrived quickly and looked new. I¡¯ve had it for almost a month and it¡¯s working perfectly, there was no visible damage or scratches. Would recommend but it¡¯s always a risk buying a second hand phone.
            "
"78","The battery was the first to go out less than a month with the product. Two months after the product the screen started flickering for no apparent reason, and now the power button isn't working. When reaching out to Techarvard the reseller and asking for advice or a refund the response was simply, No. This was the total sum of the advice. It was a risk buying from an unknown reseller, but took the chance and would not make the mistake again even though we were told it was certified and like new, it really isn't.
            "
"79","For the first week, this worked great after that the touch screen is not working. I go to call, the person does not answer I can't end the call. I try to use an app its clicking on the top area when my finger is touching the middle or bottom area. Complete horrid product!The person that passed this as QC really needs to loose their job. I am a single mom and putting out $300.00 is quite an expense, shame on the company or person that sold this phone as a working item.The only good thing about all of this is that I bought it from Amazon so I will get a refund. I have NEVER bought anything from Amazon that did not work. Amazon either don't sell refub products or place stronger restrictions on the vendors that sell.
            "
"80","I got the phone yesterday it came in a white box with bubble wrap with the phone inside it, but one thing is that they left it on my porch but luckily someone was there to intercept it for me. now when I opened it there was no headphones but charger cord and the box that you plug into the outlet with. now it worked well but on the outside around the camera there was little dark scratched I couldn't get them off so they were just imprinted on the phone also today i noticed there was a little dent by the power button but it still works perfectly, if you thinking about getting this phone get a case and a screen protector but other than that good phone.
            "
"81","Received phone and was hoping to gift it. However, after a few testing, I realized that it takes 30 minutes to 90 minutes simply for the phone to establish connection with the cell tower.I have tried resetting network settings many times without remedy. I don't care about the unit being defective since Amazon has a good return policy. I do however care that  the item is labelled with ""refurbished"" condition despite its defective behavior. Hope it was not something deceptive.
            "
"82","This item arrived fast, in excellent condition, worked right out of the box, and came with a Lightning-USB cable, a generic USB wall wart, and an acceptable plastic case and screen protector.
            "
"83","So at first the phone was great but as time went on I noticed the battery life was so bad!!!! I can charge my phone all night and I¡¯m like an hour only have like 30 percent and then I turn it off and back on I all of the sudden have 60 percent! Then at like 20 percent sometimes it will just die and not turn back on but as soon as I put it on the charger is has 40 percent when it turn back on! I would buy the battery life is bad!!
            "
"84","Purchased two iPhone 6 phones, and read the reviews about how awful this company is. What a load of hogwash. Both phones were fully functional, clean, refurbished, and running fine. Bought one from them before. A small glitch had me send the phone back and they sent an almost new one. Most of the complaints are for the non-Apple chargers and cord, or the plain box it comes in, or their own inability to use the phone. I'll bet if you, informed Apple user, know how to use an iPhone without tech support having to do things for you, and you understand a return for service warranty and it doesn't include repairs for your part in damaging a phone, then you'll love this place for a great refurbished phone for less than what others will have to pay. My kids are thrilled, and won't put them down...
            "
"85","We just received this refurbished item yesterday. While I know a refurbished phone is not brand new, it should work, and the screen does not work.  It freezes, and the touch aspect of the screen does not work.
            "
"86","This IPhone is not working!! The battery runs off too quicky: I got it as a present for my step parents and they tell me that the battery doesn,t even last half a day. Please contact me to see what can we do about it. Thank you
            "
"87","It took hours to get the phone up to full charge as soon as I got it. Then it continued to drop down to very low charge (4%) and it would pop back up to a higher charge in a matter of minutes. It kept shutting off due to low battery. The battery is completely junk. I cannot understand how this phone ever passed any inspection.
            "
"88","If I could give a zero star, I would. I bought a certified refurbished iPhone 6 4 months ago but it just stop working. At first I thought the battery had died but when I took it to a specialist, they said the motherboard was fried. There wasn¡¯t any water damage or other damage that would be the cause of it. The specialist said they should have never sold the phone as it was on its last legs. When I called the company to ask for a refund or replacement, they said since it was past the 3 month warranty day they couldn¡¯t help me. THEY SOLD ME A BASICALLY BROKEN PHONE. Do not waste your money! The only upside was that the outside of the phone looked almost brand new.
            "
"89","I bought one and found it a crashed in the buttom and the finger print doesn't work and i have an issue with the sim card so i couldn't use the mobile at all, i couldn't return it because i sent the mobile to a shipping agent to use it abroad, it took a long time to receive the mobile, and once i got it i found the return period has finished, Unfortunately it's totally rubished, not recommended
            "
"90","Perfect condition! Works great with Verizon!!
            "
"91","the phone came with a fried up battery, absolutely atrocious. It barely held a charge for about an hour and 30 mins. In the end, the only 'solution' was to return the phone and re-order it with hopes to get a decent battery. Of course,e this's a game that no-one should play; therefore, I quickly walked away with my money back and a sour taste of disappointment.
            "
"92","It works fine and it was in good condition when I took it out the box. But there's one thing I'm not so satisfied about. It's just that every time I take a picture the ""Sound"" always goes off and I can't turn it off smh. But other than that I like it.
            "
"93","As soon as I received the package I could hear something loose inside. I opened the box and I can hear and feel that there is certainly something inside the iPhone 6S loose in there. The flashlight doesn't work, the volume buttons are pressed in, the Battery Absolutely Sucks (it says it is fully charged, but I use it for 15-20 minutes and it drops to 50% or less). Good thing I bought warranty because this is Junk.
            "
"94","DO NOT ORDER!! They say that the phones are referbished but my came with a dead battery. I have to keep it connected to the charger all the time and if I unplug it it dies instantly. It starts to start up and goes to the charging icon 6-7 times before it turns on. I am very disappointed with this product. I wouldn't want anyone to go through what I am. I would give this company negative stars if I could. They say one thing but send you a product that contradicts them. I would send it back but I can't because this is my only way of communicating.
            "
"95","I got this phone one week ago ad had issues with the battery life immediately. My wife also has the same refurbished phone and experiences the same thing. It does read 85% as the warranty says however you must deactivate all GPS and auto sync functions to get the battery to last 8 hours.
            "
"96","Got the phone in April. End of August it shut down and wouldn't do anything to come back on. Told me my 90 day warranty had passed which it had but upon taking the phone apart found that the phone had been underwater at some point and it appears to have had a piece or 2 replaced in order to resell it. Take 50% of your money and light it on fire and go buy something that isn't garbage. You'll save yourself 50%.
            "
"97","I am tech savvy, but this phone has some features that my previous Samsung galaxy did not have. While driving it sends a do not disturb sign. Siri makes my life a bit easier. The photos quality is pretty good. The sound is not as good as my htc phone, but for $200 I have an unlocked GSM phone. No complaints here.

"100","iPhone came as described but unfortunately the charger didn¡¯t work at all, I had to go buy another one which is unacceptable. This is a gift & really was hoping it would all be ok but it wasn¡¯t. The plug or cord didn¡¯t work, i tried changing one out at a time but both of them didn¡¯t work.  So far the phone seems to be ok , hopefully I won¡¯t be changing this review.

"101","I was really excited and happy because my last phone I had given away and I decided to buy myself a new one sadly .. when I got it I charged it and waited so I could login and we¡¯ll that . After I unplugged it turned off . It showed the battery and how you needed to charge so I thought maybe it because it hasn¡¯t been used in so long but then it kept doing that after charging it and I got tired of it so now I¡¯m returning... I hope they check the phones before they sell them .

"102","Bought in June, by October,  screen was loose  and had vertices striped lines. Touch did not work anymore. Had to spend an additional $100 to get it repaired
            "
"103","I bought this for my granddaughter and so far seems to be working well. It arrived a day late but but was shipped on time (postal or maybe an amazon error) The phone was as advertised. No scratches or obvious defects. The color and memory capacity are correct. The phone is unlocked as advertised. Overall I'm happy with this purchase and the seller.
            "
"104","It took four hours of charging after I received the phone for it to even turn on, and after i FINALLY got it to turn on after almost giving up, the thing dies on 90% battery. So, I put it back on the charger for 10 minutes and pulled it off again only for it to die a few minutes later. Long story short, don't waste your time or money on this ""certified refurbished"" sh*t because obviously it isn't. (side note: if you were going to refurbish any part of a phone why would you skip the battery??? that's like the most important part????)
            "
"105","My son in college needed a replacement phone and this was worse than his old one. He said there's a click sound sometimes when he taps on the screen and it keeps shutting off on him with over 50% battery left.

"106","Normally, I would never have gotten a phone online because I¡¯m nervous of 2nd hand electronics. To my surprise the phone works like I got it new from the store! If you want to get your kid or special someone a phone without having to pay the store price I recommend this! Make sure you buy through amazon¡¯s certified refurbished program.
            "
"107","If buying one of these refurbished phone make sure you ask the question if the phone is from Japan or Korea. These phones will always make the shutter noise while taking a picture. Truly annoying and than reason for only one star because of the lack of information.
            "
"108","I purchased two of these phones for Christmas presents.  One worked well and continues to work well.  One slowly started to lose functionality whereby the screen increasingly lost sensitivity to touch.  Five months after purchase the phone is unusable.

"110","The battery on my phone is horrible. I charge it the majority of the day and all night long. I just used it for about ten minutes and it went from full charge to 'dead battery' and shut off. Then I can't turn it on until I plug it in and then it goes back up to the full charge until I use it for ten minimum more. So frustrating! I tried to contact the seller but didn't get a response. I guess it's time to go to an Apple Store.
            "
"111","Why bad reviews? It¡¯s been 8 months and my phone works flawless, no battery problem, great resolution, and amazing. I have traveled UK, Canada, South Asia with his phone and changed various international GSM sim. And now buying again for a family memeber. Go for it.

"112","Okay first of all, I just got this Iphone today and I purchased this specific one because of the memory. I setup the phone went through all the steps only to find out that it does not have 64Gb of storage and only has 16GB.

"117","When I received the phone the device could not figure out how much battery it had. I have no idea what the issue was, but the phone would constantly change the amount of battery remaining in the top corner of the screen so I had no idea what the battery level was.

It booted up after couple minutes of charging, definitely a keeper, unfortunately battery sucked on it, I shipped it to apple in California, had the phone back in one week, 38$. I¡¯m using it as an international phone which roams over wifi in US. Install of the new software was painless, all I had to do is test it next to my other iPhone and scan the code on new phone.

"123","After reading negative reviews, I was a bit nervous to purchase this iphone. However, I'm glad I did. The phone is in pristine condition and if it didnt come in an amazon certified refurbished box, you'd think it came from the apple store. There are no dents or scratches, call quality and speakers are working fine so far. The screen functions normally and home button works. I'm very happy with this purchase and will come back to this seller if I ever decide to upgrade to the iphone 7 or 8.
            "
"124","I bought the phone in July 2017 and it was working perfectly. Around three months after the purchase, a problem called ""ghost touch"" appeared. The phone cannot be used at all as random ghost touches that open Apps and dial people start immediately after I unlock the phone. I took the phone to a repair shop and I was informed that there is a high chance that power module will be affected if they try to fix it. I really regret buying this phone.
            "
"125","Phone was in great shape with minimal show of use, however, the battery only lasted good for about a month. When I took it to the Apple store to replace the battery, they said it was the phone itself not holding a charge, not the battery so i had to replace the entire phone.

Was it the best purchase I made, not really I could of get something with a better price and more then 16GB. You can hear the volume clear. But one thing I don't like this owners that sell these iPhone's they don't allow you to return them if one the people gift like them.
            "
"128","The phone, unfortunately, has ""touch screen disease"" and I can't return it because the 7 day window doesn't do much good when it had to travel overseas as a gift before it is opened. $350 is a lot of money with virtually no realistic warranty. That's the gamble, I guess.
            "
"129","the phone was put in a big box with lots of paper to use as a cushion. this was a great idea and did the job, however, the phone in its original box was placed on the bottom of the shipping box, and cracked a bit. it could be more secure. the phone was easy to set up and came with a charger, and a Sim card opening pin. there was a part for headphones, but I didn't get them. The phone works great right now, however im not sure if later use is going to lead me to get a new battery.
            "

            "
"132","The phone is suck so many problems.  Do you think Amazon should not selling a garbage items. Its hurt because the person who used the phone right now is one of the victim. I bought it just because I believed Amazon is great. Yeah battery is the big issue.
            "
"133","Not good!  The screen was bad, going dark and leaving outlines of previous screen images and the phone would go nuts opening things and pressing buttons automatically by istself.  We tried contacting Vius customer service several times by phone without success - kept getting an answering machine.  No response to an email either.  We finally returned it via Amazon since we have Amazon Prime.
            "
"134","The phone works well, but the power consumption drives me mad. I turn off the app background refresh and location service, and don't use the phone, it consumes 1% power every 10 minutes. After searching relevant information on the internet, I find it may be the problem on the motherboard. I will ask the seller to change another phone for me, hope it will work.

When I received the phone it was kind of just thrown in the box but when I put my son's SIM card in and activated the phone everything works perfect with the phone. It also shipped very quick and came with a charger! So I am very excited and satisfied with my purchase. I'll update this review if anything goes wrong!

"137","We received the phone in great condition and is working fine so far. It was 3 day later then we expected but that is the way UPS and Fed Ex is with different weather forecasts. So far very pleased.
            "
"138","DISCLAIMER: I bought the phone as a gift for someone else so my experience is merely hearsay and the one day I spent with it. That being said, I was very satisfied with the phone. The screen doesn't seem to have any scratches on it but the metal case is a little scuffed up, which is to be expected from a refurbished phone. After a couple days of use, the user told me that the phone had turned off once at 10% and then booted back up after being plugged in saying it was at 47%. So far that's the only issue they've had with the phone. Good phone and some cute a$$ wannabe-iPhone packaging, 9/10.

"139","excellent product my son have very happy
            "
"140","The phone battery is not good due to which I need to charge back and forth after I use phone. That¡¯s so weird and I don¡¯t think that¡¯s good to the customer like us who buy product from you. I gifted someone and I feel so bad that the gift I have given is not good at all. So what can I do for this let me know
            "
"141","The phones are working fine. Unfortunately one of the chargers is not working. I have contacted the seller by email about a week ago and I have heard nothing in response. So on that front, I would have to say very poor customer service.Update: Funny, I keep getting emails from the seller to review: which I have done, but I still haven't heard anything back about my issue with the charger :/
            "
"142","I brought this phone and since I haven't been able to use itIt's lock with a message on the front saying it lost or stolenAnd it can't be used I will like to request for a refundAlso it's a message on the front of the phone saying I should call a number to return the phone plzzzz I will like the password to unlock this phone or my money back

"143","This is a review of an Amazon Certified Refurbished iPhone 6 from DealFisher (there are many 3rd party Amazon vendors who are members of the Amazon Certified Refurbished program). I chose a vendor who uses Amazon to stock and deliver for them - hence, ""Fulfilled by Amazon."" This is my 3rd purchase under the Amazon Certified Refurbished program. My earlier purchases were a pristine Apple Wireless Keyboard with Bluetooth (the one powered by AA batteries before they went rechargeable) and an iPhone 5s (for a friend to replace his dropped 5c). Both purchases were so pristine I decided to up my game with an iPhone 6 for myself and it arrived nearly as pristine - the back had a few wear marks, but the rear camera lens was perfect, the front screen was perfect, and since my Ringke case covers the rear, I'm happy as a clam. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE AMAZON CERTIFIED REFURBISHED  products. Pricing is cheaper than from other sources, and quality standards are higher - ""refurbished"" is used very loosely outside this Amazon program, and I have NEVER had the quality from other non-Amazon, non-Amazon sellers - ""refurbished"" and ""like new"" always arrived with screen rub marks, somewhat depleted batteries, etc.There are two negatives that aren't really negatives: you get no-name chargers and cables, and no earphones. I have plenty of official Apple chargers, but official Apple cables and approved cables by Anker, not to mentions more than a few Apple Ear Pods, so I'm ok.Now, on to the phone. First, if you haven't don't so already, there is an excellent Wikipedia article specifically on the iPhone 6. Second, the very technical review on performance on Anandtech dot com is a good place to go if you are a gear head.Now, my personal observations:My iPod touch 6th gen has horrible battery life with the same A8 chip that powers this iPhone 6 (6, not 6 Plus - the 6 Plus has the A9 chip). I even replaced it at Apple once with NO improvement.This iPhone 6, on the other hand, has superb battery life. So there are other design factors affecting battery life, apparently, and the iPhone 6 is fine (yes, I know the touch has a small battery, and I am trying to allow for that).I also have an iPhone 7, which has the A10 chip - which is supposed to be much more powerful due to the progression each year from A8 =>A9 => A10, but for normal browsing and banking app use I notice no difference. So you should be pleased with this iPhone 6 in terms of performance, battery life, and screen - the screen is gorgeous. I was nervous about owning a 6, since my iPhones have been 5c, 5s, 6s Plus, and 7 - no 6 - but I shouldn't have worried.Except for ""bend-gate"". This is the generation that some YouTube gorillas were able to bend in their hands, and some early users reported sit-fown and bend issues as well. BUT the bad publicity died down, so either it was over-blown or Apple changed something. Just something to read up on in Wikipedia, not to scare you!SO - great refurbish standards, thanks to Amazon. When ""Fulfilled by Amazon,"" all the goodness of Amazon shipping including Amazon Lockers. And, a fine phone, still more up to date than I am!
            "
"144","When I received phone I was a little skeptical about based on the negative reviews listed. Me personally O came  package neatly in a white box with the charge. Also I tested and saw everything was wiped off so it¡¯s clean ready for any sim chip. I too love how the phone is a rose gold color. My only downside is if you love music on your phone as ringtone you will have to purchase it. Overall phone is nice I plan to take care of mine really well hope to upgrade to iPhone 7/8
            "
"145","Got the phone and had trouble with the ear piece. I brought it into a tech at Apple and this is what he said ¡°I¡¯ve worked here almost 10 years and I¡¯ve never seen this much debris build up in an ear piece.¡± So no, it was not refurbished. They¡¯re just used phones sold as ¡°refurbished¡±.
            "
"146","In perfect condition<U+0001F44C>
            "
"147","When I received the phone I was expecting a phone to be a little scratched up, but when I opened the box I noticed the screen was popping out a bit. I was fine with this until I realized the phone was slightly bent. Along with the phones bend the phone is very dented in the top right corner and the battery is at 81% The product does state that the battery will be 80% or higher but I was disappointed to say the least.
            "
"148","We brought this phone for our 10 year old. She absolutely loves it. It works great, charges fast, and she has enough space to download the many apps she likes (issue with old phone). The phone looks new and it shipped fast.
            "
"149","So far, so good. Outside is perfect, running like new. Will update if anything change.***so a few months in now. This phone randomly shuts off. One day I go to unlock it and it just stayed black. I thought I lost it for good, but I looked up how to restart it, which is what I ended up having to do. This has happened at least three times now and more often. Don't buy. I'm sure I'll need to purchase a new phone soon. -_-
            "
"150","This is a replacement phone for a teenager. The phone has a slight scratch that shows it's used, nothing too bad. Software, screen, and battery life are all perfectly functional and acceptable.
            "
"151","I enjoyed the phone however it was just slightly smaller then I had initially anticipated. But this isn't the fault of the merchant I just simply didn't do my research. I received this item in within the specified time and enjoyed it for what little time I had however, I've since then upgraded to the iPhone 6 plus which is a lot larger in my opinion. The downside to this item is that their seem to have been an issue with the volume, I could barley hear the callers during phone conversations.
            "
"152","Rcvd phone on time but battery was no good. It took almost two days to charged and when it finally did charge the phone would die after 20 mins or less.  It would shut down in the middle of phone calls, reading emails or doing any task.  I honestly feel like this company sells bad phones.  I am in the process of returning this piece of crap and I will never buy from them again.
            "
"153","Wish i did not have to give 1 star..The phone was delivered with a bad battery, at my cost i purchased a new battery at best buy, $75.  The iphone has a bad processor, has been freezing constantly for the last 4 months.  Was told by everyone that it just needs the apple update, BS! the phone was never worked on or checked.  Spend your money elsewhere.  BUYER BEWARE!
            "
"154","CANT complaint for the purchase I did my 5 years old son loves it ..the phone works perfectly no problems it¡¯s like new I appreciate them sending me the charger since it didn¡¯t come with the phone but that says everything about a good seller customer satisfaction I will return to buy more phones in the future my brothers and sisters are looking to buy phones from ur company any day for there own kids thanks
            "
"155","Ordered TWO phones.  BOTH had to be returned.
            "
"156","So I got the phone when I was told I would get it. I¡¯ve had for about two weeks now. It looked brand new in the box and came with a charger and charger port as well as the phone. I have one concern though. My charger is no longer working or I think it¡¯s the phone battery that isn¡¯t, I¡¯m not sure. Like I said I¡¯ve only had the phone two weeks!! Plus the charger doesn¡¯t appear to be damaged in any way.
            "
"157","Worst product because of refurbished... if i make a call in no time charging goes down.... and the charger is also not a company charger....
            "
"158","The mic doesn't work when on calls. Have to use speaker phone for the other person to hear you. 2nd refurb iphone 6 purchase from this seller. First for my daughter was great, this one for me, not in complete working order.
            "
"159","Well, I suppose this is what I get, buying an iphone online. Battery life is pretty bad and it turns out the phone was manufactured for sale in Japan, so the obnoxiously loud camera shutter sound can't be muted, but other than that it works alright (some other usability issues that make me think it may have ben refurbished with non-certified parts). If you're willing to take a chance on a cheap phone, I'd suggest looking at another seller.
            "
"160","They sold me a locked phone when it specifically said on the description they were unlocked phones!
            "
"161","The product is very clean but the touch screen freezes sometimes and the included charger doesn¡¯t work, that¡¯s why I didn¡¯t give it 5 stars rating.
            "
"162","The one star is because the seller accepted my return request immediately.  The screen and case were scratched, but most importantly: The camera didn't work! No focus! Back it went. Bought new. Fifty dollars more. My advice is: don't waste your time with setup & troubleshooting an iffy device.
            "
"163","Perfect condition. No scratches or wear.  Just need SIM card. Would be nice if it came with one.
            "
"164","Thank God I got a great phone it's perfect was fast shipping and super easy to hook up at Metro I luv this phone scared about reviews but I ordered before reading them other wise I probably wouldn't
            "
"165","Have had this for a year. Still kickin!
            "
"166","Terrible.  Battery life terrible luckily I had an old iPhone battery that is good.  Power button doesn¡¯t work have to use assistive touch, ear piece speaker doesn¡¯t work.  At least have it in good working order to take peoples money.
            "
"167","The battery in this phone is completely defective. Within less than 30 minutes of moderate use, the phone was down to 65% and then suddenly died. I checked the battery capacity and it is only 71% of what it would have been as a new phone. After recharging the phone, it continued to die suddenly - some times at 50% and other times at 80%. A refurbished phone should absolutely have a good battery installed, and I feel that the seller neglected to do this.
            "
"168","Phone had a stain on the back from a previous case and the battery was shot, would not hold a charge.
            "
"169","This product showed up broken and unusable highly disappointed battery would not charge operating system flaws when plugged in this purchase causing me to go without a phone and an extra week do you not buy The good news was we were able to get a refund right away so take your chances
            "
"170","This item came perfect! I love the phone and it came with everything it said it would. It is easy to use, it has absolutely no problems.
            "
"171","The phone was either sold originally in Japan, where there is a law that the camera shutter sound must be permanently on, or it is broken. I brought this phone to the apple store because nothing could seem to turn off the shutter sound and ended up doing a factory reset, which could not fix my problem. Terrible product.
            "
"172","Has multiple flaws that aren't evident right away (screen won't turn back on if on a phone call longer than about 10 minutes for example. I rarely make calls so did not realize this till a couple months after purchase. Also, freezes up a lot. will randomly start opening apps, has a couple spots on the screen that are nearly dead to the touch. I have never gotten a phone ""refurbished"" phone that worked worth a damn
            "
"173","I have bought many used phones. They¡¯re cheap, easy and somewhat reliable. One of the things you can¡¯t count on it the battery life. This phone last about an hour to two hours on its current battery. However, for the price, you can go to any apple store and have the battery replaced for 30 dollars. The phone itself is immaculate. 5 stars. The Battery. not so much. 1 star. just go get it replaced
            "
"174","Bought this for my Dad. Only complaint he had was he couldn¡¯t hear quite well. He had to take it to an Apple store to have the speaker cleaned.
            "
"175","It stopped working for the next day i was using it i was planning to return it but it got lost
            "
"176","I am very pleased with this phone! It came packaged professionally in a plastic phone box that was labeled ""Amazon Certified Refurbished"". The phone itself looked mostly new - the only flaw was a slight discoloration around the apple logo (like where somebody had a case on it), which is covered by my case anyway. The battery holds a charge all day and I had no problems getting the phone activated at AT &T. In fact, I am planning to order my husband the same phone now.
            "
"177","I bought this phone on 2/22/19 and received it on 2/26/19 then, had to return it on 2/27/19. The phone arrived completely dead, took 3 hours to charge and when at 100% I removed it from the charger only for it to die at 95%.Phone did not stay on at all without being on the charger. Very disappointing. I would never buy from them again.
            "
"178","I¡¯ve had this phone for 3 months now and it¡¯s been great to me. I feel like it was a reasonable price and it is my first iPhone ever since I¡¯ve always had Samsung but I didn¡¯t want to spend full price on a phone for TMobile
            "
"179","It's refurbished, so it's going to have its kinks. But there is something loose in the screen so it glitches out and you have to apply pressure to make it clear again. At one points it had deleted all of my contacts and glitches out in other ways. But the phone has visible damage though
            "
"180","Worst cell phone ever, it did not charge and when I used original apple charger it charged super slow. Then, at one point after all night of full charge, battery charge dropped to 10% drastically and the phone died in matter of second. I am never gonna buy iphones online outside of the apple original site because the cell phone was suppose to be the only means of communication with my gf when she was out of the country and I was relying on this cell phone to work. Terrible waste of money.
            "
"181","Great purchase. Phone is really good and delivered as promised.Purchased in March 2017 and still working great!I wish it had Manufacturer box, headphones but i was completely aware that it is unavailable before i made purchase.Thank you!

"182","Lo mejor funciona como uno nuevo de fabrica lo recomiendo 100%
            "
"183","I have had it for about 3-4 weeks so far and it works well the volume has gone out on me once before but ever since it occurred i haven't had any problems. Overal i think is i pretty good product the packaging is not the best but the phone came without a scratch it looked brand new. I will try to update my feedback after a month or 2
            "
"184","works amazing. came in very high quality in a new box. however the charger did not work. i tried in severa different outlets. but the phone was perfect. no cracks or scratches on the screen or the metal on the back. functions very well

"185","I had to return the original phone but the customer care was very helpful and the turn around was so fast! This new phone is perfect!! Thank you!

"186","Great phone!! Got in within a week. Everything works great. It looks like a brand new phone. Except for one minor scratch on the front corner,the phone is in perfect condition.
            "
"187","On GOD this phone looks brand new ,unused, unissued before me. It¡¯s fast, charges fast, with a good battery life. Only thing is it gets hot after extended use of about say an hour or so. This is my first iPhone so I don¡¯t quite know if the hot battery is normal or not but I¡¯ll try to give an updated review after a few weeks.... If possible.
            "
"188","Phone came in excellent condition, no knicks or dents. Unlocked phone works on Verizon
            "
"189","Bought this phone in Aug and within a couple of days noticed that the battery kept dying quicker and quicker. Didn't download apps, had the lighting on the lowest point trying to keep as much battery life as possible. Eventually had to keep it on ""life support"" with a charger attached to it at all times. Became ridiculous. Sent the phone in for a refund... I'm still waiting for it.
            "
"190","Phone does not work. I tried to return it and the company did not respond to my email
            "
"191","The clear film protecting the screen was loose at the corner, but that's okay considering it's refurbished.  Everything else was good as new.  It works perfectly.

"192","This was a gift for our kid. The only it needs is a sim and it is ready to go. It works great and had no issues getting it going. And of course the kid loves it.

"193","The phone is locked and does not work as advertised. When you contact their help desk, they will not help you solve the issue.
            "
"194","GPS function not working. I have to be right next to the wifi box in the house for wifi to work, and now the phone battery is not working and the phone has separated at the seam
            "
"195","the screen was clearly re done and the seams were not done correctly because one corner is lose and goes up and down with slight pressure.Not a renewed phone by amazon detailed standards and also the back has several scratches and a sticker label that would not remove itself.unsatisfied with what was represented to be a renewed (New) phone
            "
"196","thus product is absolutely amazing!when i bought u wasnt sure but when it arrived it was just like new. I have had it for about a week and it is perfect. it also will work with almost any servixe provider if you just buy that conoanies sim card.FYI it is a nano sim card
            "
"197","Brought this for myself and had this for almost a year I brought the warranty as well apple never fails
            "
"198","Phone worked just fine and quite normally until the warranty went out. Coincidence? Maybe? Then all of the sudden wouldn't recommend gnome the charger. Took unit to get fixed wasn't the battery.. wasn't the charging port, said it was an operational system issue. Fantastic! Emailed this seller asking about options because literally the warranty went out like that day... uh.. no response. So to me now certified refurbished is like warmed up leftovers.
            "
"199","The battery is terrible. I took it to the apple store and they said it was a sketchy phone. They didn¡¯t want to even change the battery saying something with Japan where it normally would say sprint or Verizon etc.

"200","Great Product.
            "
"201","Love it!!! Simple great!
            "
"202","ordered this for my granddaughter in November 2018 and so far so good, she loves it
            "
"203","The phone looks great but it's awful! Do not buy these refurbished phones. It's like an iPod it will only work with wi-fi, even though I have unlimited data with at&t it will not allow you to use data. I have spent so much time on this it's ridiculous! It turns out the phone isn't unlocked either! Do not buy from Dealfisher.
            "
"204","I like the screen. Excuse it was clean and had. I scratch but the back of the iPhone had a lot of scratch . 30 minute after using the phone it started getting really hot and the battery started draining really really fast so I hade to go to a local phone repair and get a new battery. I recommend that the sellers sale what they say they will sell
            "
"205","iPhone 6 refurbished is horrible not even 6 months and this iPhones board and antennas broke. Really upset with the amount of the purchase and of my hard earned money go to waste. Horrible quality control of selling these to their consumers. DO NOT BUY!!!

            "
"208","Great if u need a cheaper replacement phone. It¡¯s fast and normal just like an iPhone had no issues with it at all. Only thing was the back was a little discolored but not a problem because it¡¯s not noticeable with a case on. Delivery was fast as well!
            "
"209","Do not buy anything from the seller I just received my iPhone 6S and the battery is not charging I don¡¯t understand what people receive a payment to give a crappy product do not I repeat do not buy anything from the seller even though it said the battery percent was 80% lifetime of the battery it literally doesn¡¯t charge to the full potential and stay charged
            "
"210","No where in my order did this show as a phone that came from Japan. In japan, it is illegal to photograph someone without their permission, so iPhones there don¡¯t have the ability to disable the camera ¡°click¡±. This phone was for my 13 year old who is passionate about photography. So I hear this camera click quite often, with no way to mute it.
            "
"211","It's well packages and looks like new. Substantially slower than my iphone X but may be due to its outdated chip. Gifted my mother also g with an apple watch and she is enjoying herself.
            "
"212","We bought this iphone in June this year and it has a defective antenna and cannot use data outside Wi-Fi areas.  It was sporadic at first so we took it to our network provider.  The SIM card is fine it's just the phone.  I bought it for my son and he cannot make phone calls or text without Wi-Fi.  It is worthless.  Do not buy a refurbished phone.
            "
"213","Has a few scratches, turns off sometimes automatically even with 40 % battery.
            "
"214","It worked well for the first 2 months or so, but then gained what I¡¯ve come to identify as ¡°touch disease¡±. This isn¡¯t anyone's fault but mine. Evidently every iPhone 6 is susceptible to this ¡®diagnosis¡¯.
            "
"215","This phone did come safe but unfortunately the battery life goes dead in just a matter or seconds the percentage is dropping drastically. The function of the phone is slow.The battery is drains so fast even when it¡¯s in 30% it will cut right off and require me to charge it

"217","I ordered an iPhone 6 as a gift and once we got to the store to officially switch it over, the phone shut itself off and displayed the ¡°empty battery¡± screen. After charging for 30+ mins, the phone shut off again displaying the same screen. Kind of ruined the birthday gift.
            "
"218","Bought this iphone last April. Afyer 5 montjs of regular use, battery is absolutely dead, lasting 20 minutes when fully charged and without even usibg it as a phone. This is really a shame, refurbished certified should mean its a good product, now I feel my money was taken from me!! I do expect a solution and the money fully refund, that would at least calm what I think right now!!!!!

"219","This was a great phone, worked well and in perfect condition. Customer service was excellent too.
            "
"220","I brought this back in February, the 90 day warranty is now expired and all of a sudden the phone shuts off on its own, when fully charged and takes a few minutes to come back on. Sometimes it will vibrate nonstop after it is powered off. The phone itself has always been in a case and has no damage. It's frustrating that now it decided to magically not work once I find out the warranty is no longer valid!!!
            "
"221","Honestly horrible customer service,I call for days no one answer.The phone arrived with many problems , charging problem,Audio problem,you can¡¯t hear the voice,And some time do not start.Company refused to repair.Don¡¯t believe the positive star.Do not buy

"222","I brought this phone for my son 21st September,2017 and after exactly one after the returned date past the phone shut down. He got it working again signing into  iTunes and resetting it. In two(2) weeks after the battery started swelling ,this cause the sides to open and the phone keeps shutting down.
            "
"223","The listing on the phone indicated ""refurbished"".  The battery was in very poor shape and the phone would suddenly turn off when showing as much as 60% battery life.  Took the phone into Best Buy and was told by Best Buy the battery had 950 charging cycles on it and typically the batteries are only good for 500.  From my perspective ""refurbished"" is not an accurate description for the phone I received.
            "
"224","This phone lasted 35 days. It died because that happens sometimes. Had an Apple store check out the phone and the best response I got was its not able to be repaired. So I paid $10 a day for a phone so a full star rating is too much!
            "
"225","the phone was in a good perfect condition with no visible scratches, it came with an original charger and light cable.. it was really good in shape.
            "
"226","The phone is fine, but the SIM card plate is defective. Every once in a while the SIM keeps coming out of place and  when it does that my phone begins to search for network and it takes up to 24 hours to find a network back  which is very inconvenient . Is there anyway that I can get my I SIM card plate repair ??
            "
"227","Great value for this phone.  No noticeable blemishes for refurbished model.  Easy to setup with my provider.  Works great

"228","My speaker is messed up I can¡¯t film with a constant noise in the background I think it¡¯s ok and worth it but I¡¯d also say this is kind of a hit or miss type deal
            "
"229","This phone was dead and could not be charged by the phone provided or the cable from my old phone. I then check the cable provided as it charged my old Iphone which again proves this phone is JUNK with a dead battery that could be charged. HOW could anyone check a phone much less send a phone out with a DEAD BATTERY?
            "
"230","Works great. Can¡¯t even tell that it wasn¡¯t new.
            "
"231","It kept glitching and would stop working. I would have to restart it multiple times a day. And it held no battery, after my 30 minute train ride I would lose almost half my charge. I ended up returning it after 2 weeks.
            "
"232","Bought it a couple months ago and still works good, great condition, excellent product

The phone was bent, the battery dies within 20 mins after being fully charged, the speaker sounded raspy, somehow the phone is unable to connect to my WiFi, the charger was not an original iPhone charger, the connection overall was poor. The cost of this phone $200. I would not recommend.
            "
"235","no issues works great.
            "
"236","I was really excited about this phone. It looked and functioned erfectly in every way except for its battery...The battery randomly dies even when the phone is charged at 80% and I cant just turn it back on, I have to plug it up to the charger because at that point it acts like it really has only 0%. Gonna return this and get a refund. I'll just buy a brand new phone :(
            "
"237","Received the phone with the outer screen yellow as a crayon. The battery only charges to 50% and does within three hours of usage. Extremely unhappy with the item.
            "
"238","Workks just like a brand new phone besides the battery life. Quick delivery, would purchase again.
            "
"239","
            "
"240","After using it for 20 minuets the phone just shut down and will not power back on no matter what I do. I brought this iPhone into the Apple store and they said this phone can not be turned on and will cost a crazy amount of money to fix. It was as a bad phone to begin with.
            "
"241","Phone is acting crazy. It has a beep when you¡¯re signing into it  and it won¡¯t get signal a lot of time and will be out of service. Even if it¡¯s sitting in the same place all the time. Phone was not new and did not come with an iPhone box.
            "
"242","The one phone never worked at all, I took it to istore and I was told it cannot read the sim card, either because it is a black listed phone or previously repaired, the other phone worked for one week and last week the battery just switching off but when you charge it says full, but both phones are not genuine because when you switch on the screen is black and the apple sign is white, so I want to return them for refund as soon as possible.
            "
"243","Product arrived on time in perfect order.  Packaging was great, and the product is in excerllent condition.  I  could have been convinced it was new vs. refurb.  Battery life is fine, and cosmetically excellent.  If the older model is OK, then why pay the big difference to purchase new?
            "
"244","I'm having issues with the phone as the receiver is not working properly, cant hear the caller well. Also the phone turns off by itself and drains the battery.
            "
"245","This phone stopped working 60days after I purchased it for my daughter for her birthday.... Don't buy from them.
            "
"246","Had the phone since May. The battery last about 5 min when running maps. After trying to replace the battery Apple tells us there is water damage so they cannot replace it. Buyspry the provider of the device won¡¯t do anything to help as we are a couple days out of warranty. My fault for not realizing we had 90 days.
            "
"247","This phone was all that it was supposed to be. It is in very good condition.
            "
"248","Perfect replacement for my lost work phone.  Only complaint would be that the charger was a knock off, but I don¡¯t care.
            "
"249","Do NOT buy, idk who is certifying these as refurbished but it's conplete bull. My phone is completely broken. It came dead, took hours to turn on. Finally set the whole thing up and the screen went black and if you hit the home button a weird green circle on the LCD popped up. Did a reset and the battery said it was completely dead when it was 100% charged. Absolutely NOT tested.
            "
"250","this phone ran good for about two months and after that i had undergo severe functionality problems and the battery swelling up also but after that the LCD went out in the phone literally causing me to have to buy a new phone literally two weeks till the date that i bought it last year overall this refurbished phone was cheap but ultimately a waste buy a new phone.....
            "
"251","Great phone!
            "
"252","This phone has been great. Very pleased overall
            "
"253","It's a really good phone, not crashing, lagging, or anything else like that. Phone arrived a day early. The only thing is that the battery was at the end of it's life. Found someone to replace it for $30. Now it works amazing and I don't have to charge it for at least 9 hours. If the battery was new I would give 5 stars.
            "
"254","Great quality, nice battery life for a used phone. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.
            "
"255","excellent, it works great! very happy
            "
"256","So far, everything as been Amazon with the phone. Did get an odd message when the battery was low I haven¡¯t seen before but this has been like opening a brand new phone.
            "
"257","The phone seemed to be in excellent working condition until now, 4 months after the purchase the screen is just a gray/blue. Warranty was only until May. I wish I would have spent the extra on a NEW phone with a proper warranty. This phone was very well cared for and my money is wasted!
            "
"258","After about 6 months the phone freezes
            "
"259","Yes I did receive my iPhone and it works perfectly.
            "
"260","Ordered a phone for a family member and it was new like from the Apple store.
            "
"261","Good for 5 year old cant get fort knight tho.
            "
"262","My son loves this phone! It works great and the shopping experience was great.  No problem
            "
"263","Poor battery life, poor cell reception, had to return it.  Ear buds damaged
            "
"264","Bought as gift. Item did not work. However it was easy to return and money refunded in a prompt manner. Would try to purchase again.
            "
"265","Battery health was only 57% percent. It was charged to 60% at night, all background data was turned off, and by the morning battery was only 27%. Very disappointing. If the battery health was better, this would have been an awesome phone for the price.
            "
"266","Good phone
            "
"267","Had the phone for a week in a half and it turned offa bs turned back in with a message saying phone disabled connect to iTunes first of all I have no wifi in the house or an computer so when called they was pose to call me at a time I was at an computer but never did never again will I order from amazon again
            "
"268","Great works and looks like new was a little worried about ordering but turned out amazing. Battery life is average don¡¯t use it that much. The made sure the replaced the battery with a new one before sending it to me good seller. For the ones with battery problems turn off background refresh and keep battery saver enable you¡¯ll be fine
            "
"269","Phone kept powering off sent it back the very next day. Battery would say charged to 100% then drop to 3% within 5 mins then power off. This was my first time buying from this dealer so I don't know if this is normal or it was just the phone I received, but safe yourself some time and go through another dealer.
            "
"270","The phone is perfect. They were no defects on case and it works wonderfully. Very pleased and feel smart to not have paid price of new one.
            "
"271","It's been 4 months. So far so good
            "
"272","This phone looked fine, but within 30 days the battery wouldn¡¯t stay charged and the phone will just shut off at random. I¡¯m so mad we wasted $160 for a phone that lasted 40 days...10days past the option to return it. Do not buy phones refurbished from this company or any others. Save your self the hassle and just get a new phone. Terrible terrible terrible!!!
            "
"273","muy bueno
            "
"274","Phone looked and works great thanks again
            "
"275","I bought this for T-Mobile lines I was adding to our family plan. We¡¯ve had them for over 2 weeks now everything is working properly.. the T-Mobile rep was able to easily use the phones with SIM cards from T-Mobile.
            "
"276","Buy a new phone dont waste your time. Battery wouldnt charge and have to pay return shipping
            "
"277","Ok
            "
"278","purchased about 10 months ago and began using after Christmas. Started experiencing intermittent battery issues around Feb  (phone discharging too fast and taking about 8 hours to fully charge. then around July phone began to warp.In October screen began to crack (not the screen protector but the screen itself).  Buyers beware!
            "
"279","This is our second time purchasing an iPhone refurbished from Apple through Amazon and we couldn't be more pleased.
            "
"280","When the phone was delivered to me, the microphone did not work during phone calls (unless the call was on speaker) and shortly after the screen started to change colors in the top left corners and was not working properly.
            "
"281","So far so good!!!! I'm beyond pleased with this purchase! Just what I wanted and pretty much in brand new condition! My opinion, they could be charging more for this phone. Thanks for the wonderful product as promised!
            "
"282","I am still using this phone and the battery life holds good while I am at work
            "
"283","Honestly, one of the glitchiest smartphones I have ever used. Not sure if it¡¯s the iOS update to 11.3 or whether it¡¯s the hardware itself, but it takes ages to open apps some times or just turns itself off and cannot recognize my SIM card afterwards. Bought it as a quick replacement for my shattered Galaxy Note 5 and I have been thoroughly disappointed so far.
            "
"284","Apple iPhone 6, GSM Unlocked, 64GB - Gold (Certified Refurbished)i bought this cellphoen in july 2017 , the first months the phone was work so good, but one day the screen just press by itself and i thhought that was a problem for one day , but now its the moment that i can not use my phone , all the time the screen are pressing , open and close many apps.
            "
"285","I never give anything 5 stars but I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it.
            "
"286","Phone arrived before anticipated. It works great. Love it!
            "
"287","The touchscreen board is gone
            "
"288","This was one of the worst purchasing experiences I have ever had. I received the phone and the home button along with the Siri feature did not work. Sent emails and received no resolution to the problem, now the phone has been owned for 3 months and will not hold a charge. I am not sure what certified means if the product does not work correct and you are stuck with no resolution.
            "
"289","I need to return this product.  The touch screen will work for a minute and then lock up.  I am not happy with this purchase.  Your website says thatit is certified refurbished and goes through a testing process.  I do not understand how this phone passed any tests.  How do I return it for a refund or an exchange with a phone that worksThank You,John Cotter
            "
"290","The phone came in quickly and looked great. No visible damage, or blemishes. When I charged the phone, and turned it on is when I noticed the screen was defective. There was a blurry spot that took up 1/5 of the screen on the bottom right side of the phone. I gave it two stars because everything else appeared in good condition. The return process was very easy.
            "
"291","Had scratches all over and screen was cracked. Definitely returning this. After attempting to return, you even have to wait for approval. I have been and amazon customer for over 16 years and never received an item this bad.
            "
"292","Nothing at all wrong with phone- I had to return and reorder as it acquired a cracked screen before I even set it up. I use older iPhones and finally went to 6 from 5s. Amazon is the bomb! Love Apple products and iPhone. 3rd purchase from DealFisher.<U+0001F44D><U+0001F44C><U+270C><U+FE0F>
            "
"293","Good product
            "
"294","This iPhone seems perfectly fine except that the battery is not new and the phone shuts down constantly no matter how fullyhe battery is. The phone was advertised as certified refurbished but it clearly was sold knowing that the battery needed replacing. The battery health report in the phone settings tells me that it needs a new battery.
            "
"295","Got the phone and everything seemed to be working fine, but then there was a terrible data issue, my carrier works with this phone, i can send sms texts and call but the actual data does not worked, checked with provider and they said it should be working and that there must be a hardware issue
            "
"296","Phone looks & works great! I bought the iPhone for my son, he's had no issues.
            "
"297","All of those are good, but little defected with some spots and/or tapped outside the border, these are considerable to me because of half price. Otherwise screen and batteries are good without one of them shut down when charge is 17%. In my country iPhone doesn't market the products. So no objection for the little defects of refurbished products. Mentioned that don't expect the headphone with this set.
            "
"298","Only a small scratch near the headset hole. No problems connecting to my phone service provider. Phone is working great, it's only been a few days but so far, so good.
            "
"299","The has a very good looking and is functioning well with all web browsers and medias. The only thing it is still unlocked <U+203C><U+FE0F>My young cousin delayed to put a SIM card and he was just using it for browsing. When he took it to the T-Mobile in order to put his SIM card, they found the phone is still locked
            "
"300","I was skeptical about ordering an ""unlocked"" phone online but its exactly as advertised. He was able to insert his sim card and use it immediately
            "
"301","When I got the phone, about a week later, I started having difficulties. Now that I have gotten a carrier, it won¡¯t let it work.. The service is on and everything but says either no service 99.6% of the time or will show the carrier for a few seconds then go away.. I¡¯ve went to many many people about it and they¡¯re all telling me the same thing; it¡¯s the phone itself.
            "
"302","The phone works perfectly right, looks brand new and has no issues. I got the value for my money. This review is exactly a month since I got the phone...nice product!
            "
"303","The phone arrived on time, and it¡¯s in very good condition (no scratches etc.). The battery life is at 91%, which is not bad for a phone that has been used in the past. I¡¯ve had the phone for 4 days, and so far I have not noticed any glitches or technical issues. Overall, This was a good buy/experience with this company.
            "
"304","I was afraid of purchasing a phone but circumstances came up were I kinda just had too. So far so good !! I even ordered a second one after my sisters phone broke. I hope we get the same quality phone the second time around. Looks and works like new!
            "
"305","This case is amazing<U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D> i got an otterbox and while it kept my phone safe, it was too bulky. This case is bulky enough for me to feel safe, but thin enough to fit in my pocket and i love it!!! This is a good one, dont sleep on this. And the seller is very friendly and cooperative. Love this case!!
            "
"306","My iPhone 5S stopped working on me so I  looked for an affordable upgrade. Everyone was complaining about the battery but mine has lasted me fine since I¡¯ve had it! I ordered it a couple months ago now and it¡¯s one of the best purchases I¡¯ve made on Amazon.
            "
"307","So I waiting so long to get the phone was so happy and when I put my sim in it won't read so I thought it was me..I went to the phone company which was cricket and it didn't work tried at&t and it didn't work  like wtf if ur gonna sell something make sure it works before u decide to send it smh
            "
"308","The phone arrived with a completely dead battery.  It would not hold a charge at all.I attempted to contact the seller and ask for a replacement battery or phone but never heard back.I absolutely would not buy this product from this seller.  Avoid.  Not worth the hassle.
            "
"309","What I liked the most about this product is that it was in great condition upon arrival and it is still functioning well today! There were literally no blemishes or scratches on this item.
            "
"310","I don¡¯t recommend getting this phone at all. I only had the phone for two months before it wouldn¡¯t hold a charge, started glitching, and shut off completely. I thought it was a battery problem so I got a replacement and then found out it wouldn¡¯t ever turn back on.
            "
"311","I am very pleased with my phone. My mother in law purchased this for me when my phone finally gave out. I was hesitant on a refurbished phone but she did a lot of research and came across this seller. I LOVE my phone. It is flawless except for the tiniest scratch by the charging port but it¡¯s not noticeable. Very pleased
            "
"312","I trying to get a new phone for my nephew on birthday and goes to show that the iphone was very unacceptable. The battery life is ¡°trash¡±, It will die at 50% and it took over a day to get back at 100%. I need another properly functioning phone from you guys. Due to the fact that i had to go buy a new battery for my nephew. Highly upset <U+0001F92C>

"316","This phone was not able to be activated through Verizon. I read all descriptions and it clearly stated it was ready to activate. I am now unable to return and am stuck with a very expensive and useless phone.
            "
"317","Got this phone for my husband. It was a lot easier for him to use than his old android phone. Was happy with the phone until recently. It would fully charge & then be down to a 13% charge in just a few hours. Thought it might need a new battery but then it wouldn't charge at all!! So now I'm ordering a new charging port. Found out the warranty was out less than a week ago. Not so happy with it now :(
            "
"318","Phone was in excellent condition. Had no problem connecting to my carrier AT&T once I put in my Sim card. Included in the packaging was a contact number in case I had any issues.
            "
"319","Exactly what I expected & wanted. Works well on AT&T network. Recovered from iCloud backup easily & works well. Good value for $.
            "
"320","A whole year later but I¡¯m making my review off of this phone right now. The only produce experienced is freezing and my battery dying at crazy precents from 87% being the highest but it will usually die at 17% or less.
            "
"321","I got my ""refurbished iPhone"" plugged it in and it never took a charge... Never got to turn it on.So they refurbish phones without testing them??? I think they are not refurbished at all!!!Find another seller. I am returning this broken refurbished phone. <U+0001F621>
            "
"322","Phone good but battery life is terrible,  literally doesn't last 30 min after fully charged.
            "
"323","I bought one for my wife. The first I got had a display issue i.e., it started flickering & turned off after some use (sounds like a heating issue). I returned the product and also informed about the shipment address change as well. The replacement was shipped to the old address, which caused quite a long journey for the phone to arrive where I live now. Anyway, the replacement is dud as well.. it goes immediately into an endless reboot loop and the mute button is also damaged. Btw, the product info states ""..but does not include headphone, manual or SIM card."" The replacement phone I got had someone's SIM card inside, so obviously no one even bothered to check the phone before sending it out. Great job guys!
            "
"324","Battery dies at 75% I¡¯m trying to return or replace. Will update when I¡¯ve done so.

"326","Was a used for u could see the markings on it, please indicate these things when selling to customers. I would have preferred I buy a new phone. The battery life sucks for 100% it¡¯s dies in less the 15 minutes. Disappointed much was a birthday gift to my son

            "
"329","Please do not buy from this seller. The phone was discharging practically immediately after unplugging from a full charge. Because I had to work abroad it wasn't easy to return and i needed a phone. So I just had the battery changed and hoping the phone continues to work as it seems like it was the battery problem.
            "
"330","This phone does not work unless constantly hooked up to a power cord. I do not recommend buying it. It is slow and will go dead at 90%

            "
"339","I got this phone about 4 days ago, and it's working AMAZING so far, I love it. Also, there was a lot more in the box than just the phone and charger, it came with a glow in the dark phone case, two screen protectors, 1 tempered glass screen protector, and the SIM card tool. I can't tell the difference between a new phone, and this one. I just put my cricket SIM card in it, and it's amazing.
            "
"340","Bad phone and bad seller
            "
"341","This phone was not usable. It will not start. When I took it for servicing, I was told I need the iCloud account which was used to register the phone. I have never even been able to turn the phone on. Why is this phone locked and useless?

"348","Rescued a friend that was phoneless

"349","Shipping was fairly fast. The phone, for the most part, was as described. One major flaw is that it didn't have a piece of plastic over the lens so gunk quickly built up around/in the camera. It ruined the quality of the picture because of all the little scratches.

"363","**Do not buy a certified refurbished phone from this place.  Phone worked okay for the first month, just in time for the return to run out. The phone is complete crap. Battery is crap. Phone is slower than molasses and will just turn off whenever it feels like it with no warning.  Not one thing I can do. I threw away over $300 to have a crap phone.
            "
"364","Freezes a lot, pics are not as nice as when taken with a new camera. Paid $450+ for this guy.

            "
"368","I am satisfied with the phone. Also, Amazon backs it up with a 30 day warranty, so if anything is wrong with it you can always return it.
            "
"369","Like I said before I accidentally submitted it, I was going to return it but it would have took a month to get my money back. Battery was also defective. Instead of going to Apple to replace the battery I bought a $9 replacement battery pack from Walmart and did it myself  working perfectly now. So it worked out in the end for me.
            "
"370","Good product
            "

"373","The phone takes hours to charge with using the original iPhone charge and the one sent with the phone.  The  battery dies after one hour. The volume while on a phone call is super low. I¡¯ve reset the phone and have the volume to the max. I¡¯ve only had the phone 2 days.
            "
"374","Work as aspected. I hat this phone more than 2 months ant its work perfectly
            "
"375","The battery life is terrible and it turns itself off randomly. It seems like someone returned it for those reasons but the ¡°refurbished¡± means they just put a new screen on it.
            "
"376","Absolute waste.  DO NOT BUY.  Battery is junk, there is no way this is refurbished.  If someone actually tested this phone and sent it out the door they should be fired.  I bought it a few months ago and the reviews weren't half bad, but looking now it appears the quality has gone downhill.
            "
"377","Best iPhone
            "
"378","I bought this phone about a month and half ago for my mother, until it completely fried and stopped working. She¡¯s had an Android phone that¡¯s worked for her for 4 years! This is completely unacceptable I don¡¯t normally write reviews but I really want everyone to know how dissatisfied I am with this product.
            "
"379","The camera shutter sound doesn¡¯t turn off for some reason. I don¡¯t know why. Doesn¡¯t come with original charger or headphones which both don¡¯t function right. The phone itself hasn¡¯t given me no other issues

            "
"385","So far so good.
            "
"386","Worked well, was able to use my at&t sim card without a hitch. My main drawback was that the shutter sound were not able to be silenced due to photo laws where the phone was made. Overall good quality, I just would rather be able to silence the camera sounds for public snapchatting, etc.
            "
"387","The touchscreen does not respond very well, just had the phone for few hours was not even able to complete the setup and touchscreen hung up.returned the item within a few hours.

"390","It's horrible  we have bought the new iPhone, but we received the phone in opened box without original box, without any documents and no pasport, we didn't get the headphones also. We are not sure that this is an iPhone,  but we are pretty sure that it is not new.
            "
"391","This phone worked absolutely flawlessly out of the box! No scratches, dents, or cracks of any kind on the phone. Even after three months, it's still working as expected! I would recommend, however after reading some other's reviews, it's practically a gambling game when it comes to these third party sellers.
            "
"392","great!
            "
"393","This phone did not work. I took it to a phone repair place they ran diagnostics on it and found it had not been refurbished as the seller claimed. It needed a new battery. I ended up paying the $40 myself to keep the phone. I think the seller owes me that $40 but I can¡¯t get ahold of them to request the money.
            "
"394","I bought 3 of these. Two of them work good and one is not holding charge at all. As we started using this one last phone after the 3 month return period, I am not sure how I can return this for replacement or something. Would the seller be kind to take any action?
            "
"395","I bought this phone on Wednesday and after 2 good days with no issues I left a good comment. Thin on the 3rd day the mute button stopped working. Then the volume buttons, then the home button. I don¡¯t know how long until it completely shuts down
            "
"396","Arrived quickly; good phone. The only problem is that the enclosed charging cord has already given out (I've had the phone less than 2 mos.)--so it's a cheap replica of the original Apple made charger.
            "
"397","Beautiful, fast delivery, safe packaged. Thank you so much!
            "
"398","Will not charge AT ALL. Will not respond or turn on. Screen is falling off, phone is scratched up and filthy.

"400","Complained several times battery life is very poor comes in when turned off
            "
"401","After less than 4 months owning this, the phone cannot hold a full charge for longer than 3-4 hours. Phone has a few glitches like thumbprint button that sounds like it's cracking, and phone unable to fully mute when ringer button is switched off.
            "
"402","I have got two phone from you and the first one was great and working great the second one all has been is problems I can¡¯t even get to come up as an iPhone. The battery is horrible on it worked good for a few months has been in a case the whole time.
            "
"403","My iPhone came in the mail like if it was brand new!m even thought it is certified refurbished! It is still worth the cost and pretty affordable for a person who wants to be high tech! Apple is a really good company by the way!!!

"411","Phone would not connect to wifi. Could not talk to anyone with them sounding muffled with static.  Contacted Apple Support with no solution.

I don¡¯t just get things handed to me like most people in my family and so I was really looking forward to getting to use this but it barely works the battery is terrible and it wouldn¡¯t connect to any WiFi services I would not recommend buying this item.

"418","With in two days of receiving the phone it began to glitch and have a green screen than became so hot to the touch it would have burned your hand if I didn't remove the battery.  Good thing I had bought the protection plan for this item.  They had me return it the same day.  Still waiting for my refund though.

"419","We have had constant problems with this phone.  Won't charge.  Battery needed replaced after about a month of use.  Glitchy screen.  However, all the problems occurred after the return window and support windows ended.

            "
"422","I bought this phone and from the beginning the battery sucked when I turned ok it in to the apple store to fix it they told me they couldn¡¯t cause my iPhone wasn¡¯t a real iPhone. Sure enough the font on the back where it says distributed in Cali was slightly crooked. SO NOT WORTH THE PRICE

            "
"425","Good
            "
"426","Obviously refurbished product in Certified Refurbished packaging. Some minor scratches on the metal housing of the phone and it appears the screen was replaced as there is some debris trapped between the housing and the screen. No big deal, I just pushed it into the crevice. Also, home button is very 'clicky' and the 3D Touch functionality does not work. Overall, none of this is a deal breaker. I'm not expecting an Apple refurbished phone at this price.A note on Certified Refurbished packaging. Seems like phones listed in Used Condition, Not Certified Condition, are still shown as ""(Certified Refurbished)"" in their description, so it's a bit confusing. If you want Certified Refurbished, look at the number of offers and filter by Certified Refurbished - this should ensure you get a refurbished phone. I also chose a seller with a high number of ratings figuring they would indeed be Certified Refurbished as in the description.
            "
"427","The battery keeps dying with in minutes of phone use. The phone keeps crashing and freezing. Do not buy from these people if everyone is complaining of the same issue. I did not read the reviews before I purchased. BIG MISTAKE!

"432","The reason why I¡¯m giving a one star isn¡¯t because I emailed the seller to let him know the button for the silent/ringer was very sensitive switching of and on by it¡¯s self and just wanted some assistance but never got back to me. I still Have that problem till this day. But other then that good phone.

"448","Clearly it is not ""certified refurbished"" as the battery was not put in properly and was not an Apple battery.  I wasted considerable time (read days) at the Apple store trying to get a $29 battery.  I have had to pay significantly more to get the battery changed at a third party in order to use the phone.

"476","Used iPhone from Magic Mobile Partners.  Shipping was quick.  iPhone 6 works fine.  I've noted no blemishes or anything else that would distinguish it from being a new phone.  Battery life is good.  I was reluctant to buy a used iPhone from a source that was unknown to me, so paying more on Amazon with a vendor (Magic Mobile Partners) that was reliable seemed prudent.The process of deactivating my old iPhone 5S and restoring to the ""new"" iPhone 6 was made a bit lengthier since I had to update to ""new"" iPhone 6 to the current IOS version before using iTunes to bring my existing apps and data to the ""new"" iPhone. I spent about an hour and 1/2 with that process.I appreciate now having a decent amount of memory (my 5S only had 16GB) in the iPhone.  I would buy a used phone from Amazon and Magic Mobile Partners again.

Problem after problem and now I can barely even turn my screen on without it freezing up. 6 months old and I¡¯m already going to have to buy a new phone, I expected it to pay much longer for $400
            "

            "
"569","was not unlocked

            "
"710","This product was everything I expected BUT it is stuck on Japan's dumb rule that doesn't allow the camera shutter sound to be turned off. The only remedy is to jailbreak the phone. I took it to Apple and they confirmed that a jailbreak is my easiest solution.
            "
"711","Wasn't unlocked like it said it was had to send back and pay for the postage which didn't make me happy and disappointed my 11 granddaughter was a BD present. Now she won't get her present on time

"724","it only worked for about two month after that it failed to connect to the WiFi or Bluetooth. the screen had a defect when it came. over all a bad purchase.
            "
"725","The battery is crap and it keeps crashing.  It was a complete hassle working with Amazon on this one as well.  Save yourself some time and get a new one for just a few extra dollars.
            "
"726","I bought this phone and shipped overseas.  I recently received a message from the recipient stating that the phone is not working properly, it cuts off frequently and unable to use. The second phone has no sound.  Don't recommend to buy a refurbished phone.

            "
"730","Wow
            "
"731","The battery in the phone is a joke. I do not understand why someone sells a phone that is practically useless. Or at least they should warn the buyer.

            "
"737","I bought this Iphone as a present, and when I finally opened It I couldn't even set up the Iphone because the touch screen didn't work at all. I sent an email to the company, but I still didn't get an answer. I look forward fo a solution.

            "
"742","Phone  doesn't work, if you charge it for 1 hour it stays only for 2 to 5 min. Never trust this seller. I always blindly trust amazon but from now I have to do research before I purchase.
            "
"743","Great phone
            "
"744","Works great! Only problem is that you can tell that the phone had gotten a new screen only because it was shipped to me with the bottom corner of the screen popping out more than the rest of the screen. Barely even noticeable though! But would definitely order again.
            "
"745","No Good MY TITLE SAYS IT ALL!
            "
"746","I had the phone for two days and the screen just turned pink

"747","We are just outside the 90 day return period and the phone is glitchy.  We will never buy refurbished again.
            "
"748","Loved the phone. The only thing that did not meet my satisfaction is the fact that the flash does not work. It only works sometimes
            "
"749","Great product, like new. Would recommend this product and company.
            "
"750","Product didnt last six months
            "
"751","DONT WASTE YOUR TIME! It turns on but never has any service. Can't believe this service is Amazon certified with how often people are dissatisfied. Disappointed in Amazon.
            "
"752","Phone died aftertwo months. Beware.
            "
"753","ok
            "
"754","Exactly as described. Works great and looks brand new. Phone came in a nice box with the charging equipment  and instructions. Seller definitely cares about presentation and their  packaging  would be just fine if gifting this phone.My daughter broke her original iPhone and this was an affordable and ""money well spent"" option.Once it arrived she took it to the Verizon store and they transferred her info from the old broken phone to this new one. She was then able to trade in her old phone for a new phone case and additional charger Couldn't be happier with this purchase and how things turned out.
            "
"755","Delivered on time, met all the specifications stated.
            "

The issues I am having with this phone is touch sensitive issues, the phone freezes more than occasionally please contact me back AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, @leeondra.ellis@gmail.comI have only had this phone for about 3 months I thought it was just an app so I reset the phone and it still would freeze it started to freeze a month after I got the phone I hadn't dropped it, it stays in a case 24/7, had two dents on the left side of the phone. Please and thanks for your time.
            "
"766","This is the second phone I purchased from this seller because we had such a good product the first time around, and the second was not a disappointment either. Both phones have worked perfectly, look brand new and work with both of our different carriers. The phones came ahead of the estimated arrival date and came with a charger and a cube. Would definitely purchase again when I am in the market for another phone.
            "
"767","Just as advertsed and great price! Can¡¯t find a scratch on it! Highly recomend

"772","It did not fit my IPhone and I was unable to return it to Amazon.com
            "
"773","Purchased from the Amazon Warehouse.  This is not a review of the iPhone 6 in general, just the specific phone that I ordered.  Warehouse certified that the phone was in working order, but it exhibited significant battery problems from the start.  The battery level would be listed as 100%, then the phone would shut down.  When plugged back in to charge, the battery level would show as 100% again.  Also, the battery would drop from 100% into the single digits.  When plugged back in to charge, the level would be back to 100%.
            "

            "
"779","It would be a zero but that wasn¡¯t an option... I ordered an IPhone 6 & opened the package to find an IPhone 5.

"808","Had an awesome surprise! Device is perfect and looks like new!!
            "
"809","The description of the item, specified his as ""new"" condition. The iphone's battery dies immediately once it reaches 81% of remaining power, thus making it impossible to use. Clearly not an A+ refurbished item as advertised.
            "
"810","Sadly, I now realize this phone does not have a functioning GPS. I¡¯m unhappy and wondering if I can return it. I feel I was sold a lemon.
            "
"811","This functions properly that's probably the best thing I can say as of right now. The charging cord messed up after a few uses. The battery life lasts a lot shorter than a normal iPhone 6 should.  It also shows a change in the battery is needed after a few days.
            "

"1001","I have been a proud amazon prime member for the past two years and I am more than happy to recommend amazon to anyone. However, this was the worst transaction I have had with amazon (and my more expensive transaction as well). After the warranty was up, the phone began to act up. One night, the phone had died and when I put it on the charger, it would no longer charge. The screen wouldn't even light up! I feel like it was money down the drain for a necessity. I'm very unhappy with the product and I would not recommend buying their product because there are defects with their electronics.

"1346","I was really worried about ordering a refurb after reading some of these reviews, but decided to take the risk anyways. Phone looks like new. Only issue is I think the screen may be loose because the vibration sound is not normal....also the brightness adjusts randomly which makes me think there's something wrong with the light sensor. Not huge issues and not worth the hassle of trying to return. Guess I will just have to deal with them.
            "
"1347","Great product, delivered timely.
            "

"1355","I wouldn't buy it, I already regret it buying it. I'm not doing this to make them sound bad but my front camera is half broken around the lense and for 3 days in a role my phone goes on vibrate and on silent simultaneously.
            "

Both charger and cable are non-original (SHARKK). iPhone appears to be a real one but unfortunately I didn't turn on because the screen and body is loosed.

"1501","It's Friday April 14th 2017, I've had my phone for about a good 2 weeks and it seems perfectly fine. I have experienced no issues with it so far, no cracks, dents, and or chips. Worked with my service which is metro pcs and I am happy. I was a bit skeptical at first because of all the bad reviews but I'm glad I went through with it, I bought it from buyspry or something along those lines.

            "
"1542","It was in great condition and worked great, but only for like 3 days then I lost service and couldn't connect back. They don't tell you it's a Verizon phone but it's not a big deal because verizon doesn't lock their phones. I have T-Mobile and for some reason it just stopped working and neither verizon or T-Mobile knew what to do, so I sent the phone back to get a refund. Still was in great condition and worked great but it might depend on your carrier.

"1598","Great product
            "
"1599","Very disappointed in this purchase! I understood from reading other reviews that there was a chance that there could be a problem with the battery (that seemed to be the most common complaint); however, I was willing to take a chance given the price as well as the number of positive reviews...I regret the choice. The battery was completely used, once fully charged you could not use the phone for more than a few minutes before it shut down. To make things worse the screen was damaged, it was spongy (for lack of a better word) when you touched it and images would be slightly distorted (apparently this can happen when a battery goes bad, it can expand and damage the screen). Either of these issues (the battery and the screen) should have been easily identified in any sort of refurbishing process and there is no way this phone should have been sold as a certified refurbished product.
            "

"1635","I purchased a 64GB refurbished iphone 6 gold from MyWit. I must say the service provided by the seller was almost excellent!1) Shipping - 5/5It was very fast! I ordered it on Tuesday and it was supposed to arrive on Friday but came in a day earlier. So awesome job.2) Package - 4.5/5As shown in the attached photo, the phone came in the seller's custom box with an OEM charger + USB cable. I don't think it's the same as Apple's because the material felt a bit more plastic like. However, the box came very dusty. I almost thought the iphone screen came cracked but turned out to be some dust.3) Phone - 4/5I purposely picked this one because the description says the phone should ""look like new, with minimal to no signs of wear."" Not sure what the definition of minimal signs of wear but there are few scratches that indicate ""not new."" The first thing I noticed was this deep scratch on the back of the phone where I could see the grey part underneath the white paint. Then, there was these minor scratches/dent on the left-bottom of the phone as shown in the photo! Also the mic/earphone plugging holes have minor scratches around & inside. So there's the one star I took away from.4) Performance - 4.5/5So far everything seems to work! I received it today so I might have to wait but so far, SIM Card works; fingerprint reader works; camera works; screen has no problem; no black-out issues were observed; no obvious battery issues; and it came fully unlocked (no previous user AppleID issue). The side buttons + power button work flawlessly. The phone itself seems relatively responsive just a bit laggy. It came 67% charged and so far so good! If anything comes up, I'll try to update!
            "
"1636","Everything was smooth and fast
            "
"1637","Phone became unusable in about a month.
            "

            "
"1641","Thanks for iPhone 6 I got this phone no time
            "
"1642","It¡¯s good
            "
"1643","Terrible. It shut off at 30% and won't turn back on. Now I have to pay for your mistake. I'm never buying a phone from you guys again
            "
"1644","Phone is in great condition. Battery lasts less.
            "
"1645","The bottom of the screen was lifting off the phone
            "
"1646","So far so good. Had to re start the phone once when the screen froze and I am sure to not leave it on the charger past 80%, given the iphone 6 battery needs and because the phone only came at 88% of its original design capacity. Make sure the first thing you do is download the battery life app to determine if you received a less than adequate battery in your refurbished phone.
            "
"1647","Only have it for two weeks but so far it's perfectly fine and just what I wanted!

I returned the product right away . From my personal experience , don't buy refurbished products especially when you pay so much for a phone , put a little bit more and buy it new. Now i have to returnt it and wait for my refund and that's just a waste of time. Thanks god it started to show off the defects before was too late
            "

"1696","Just day one but I am loving this phone!!! It was super easy to set up from my last one and works just like a new phone! It came with all the extra parts too like the charging cord, box, and even new headphones. Was in the iPhone box and everything packaged like it was never used before! Certainly worth the money!
            "
"1697","It's a really good phone!!!!
            "
"1698","I bought this phone for a friend, the product description explained that there may be minor wear and tear on the phone, and there was only one insignificant scratch on the back of the phone. It worked with the carrier that we use which is straight talk, and we didn't have any problems activating the phone. I am completely satisfied with the quality of the phone and how easy it was to set it up. It also came with a charger which was a plus. The phone was a great deal for the price.
            "
"1699","Really like the iPhone 6. Fits nicely in purse or pocket. Still learning how to do all I can with it. Get better service with my carrier than on other cell.phones I have had especially in the building where I live. Will be holding on to this one a good while.
            "
"1700","I was skeptical about buying a phone from here, especially a used/refurbished phone. There were some mixed reviews, some saying it was good and others having a terrible experience, however I was desperate so I gave it a go. Not disappointed at all. The phone came in great to almost new condition. It looked new, the charger that came with it was off brand, but I wasn't to worried about that. It was definitely a great buy.
            "
"1701","It was a perfect phone
            "
"1702","When I purchased this I was expecting an iPhone 6S, because this listing appeared in the middle of all the other iPhone 6S listings. But I was disappointed to find out this was a 6. Then once I realized this wasn¡¯t an S, and took it out of the box it had a golden halo around the Apple Logo on the back of the phone. Setting up the phone was even worse because this doesn¡¯t come with a dummy sim for Apple Activation at setup. I wasn¡¯t able to use it out of the box and I would never buy from them again.

"1706","Everything is A OK except for the battery. I had to update this phone to iOS 10.2 which I heard messed with the battery life in other phones so I don't know if this is an issue relating to that or the phone itself but it's an issue nonetheless.My phone will charge to 100% and everything is fine until I get to about 75%. My phone will drop to 14% or below in minutes and when I plug it in, the phone says it's charged 50% or so when it just told me it was 14%. It doesn't make sense!I will update my review when Apple updates iOS to see if the issue is fixed.
            "
"1707","Hello, I liked the phone. It is working properly and looks good.I'm within the 90 day warranty. The problem is that the charger is not working. It tells me that this is not a verified apple product and has stopped charging. It's a big part of the phone to be able to use it!Could you please contact me so that I can get a replacement charger?Thank you!

"1725","I have had this phone all of 5 mins and while setting it up it up the battery was too low to update so I plugged it in and the charger burnt me and probably would have burned my house down if I didn't check on it before I left! First thing I noticed when I was unraveling the charger was that it appeared off brand, then when I plugged it in nothing changed on the battery but figured since it was in set up mode that maybe the little changing symbol just wasn't going to appear. The changer from my old phone worked when I plugged it in and I need a phone now so I'm willing to wait a little longer before deciding to return it or not.

"1732","I have bought refurbished phones before and they worked perfectly. Customers can return them for cosmetic reasons like having a scratch. This does not affect the functionality of the phone. However, this current phone that I just bought is unusable. The phone battery charging mechanism does not work. It all of a sudden shuts down even though the battery is almost fully charged. And it does not necessarily come back up after charging. I am going to take it to the apple store to see if anything can be done and will return it if not.

"1735","I will update the stars if when I go to Apple they tell me different. But so far I received the phone and the back reads that it is a Verizon phone. I really hope not because according to the description this should NOT be the case. I still went through the set up and have not been able to make a call out. All not good indications. Not to mention I'm overseas now with minimal options. I am so mad right now.

"1736","Love the product. Came in perfect condition. Looks like new. A minor, barely visible lines. The iPhone works fine, battery in great condition, signal and reception great. I writing this review with it.

"1739","The Phone it self is perfect I had no signs of wear on it as a ""apple pro"" the only thing to say is if you are a first time iphone buyer DONT BUY FROM HERE!!! when I got the phone and used the charger that came with it it broke within the first hour of having it plugged in the whole prong was black like it shorted and then when i went to unplug the cord the prong got stuck in it and i had to work it out so if this is your first time hit up your local walmart or best buy and buy a cable these are genaric and may fail upon use

"1741","The phone came and was in perfect condition along with the other one that I purchased.  One of them took the T-Mobile Sim card perfectly and the other continued to say searching and eventually said no service .  I'm ordering a second one now after being refunded for the first one and I'm hoping that it will be T mobile compatible as advertised.  Overall the only reason this product didn't get the full five stars was that one of the two iPhones did not work when I put the SIM card in. Fast shipping & good quality otherwise.

"1743","The phone arrived with a very low battery charge. When i started charging my device, it was quite good in the first 2-3 days. Later on, even the phone charged to 100%, the battery doesn't last for not even an hour. It comes down to 20% and later to 10% immediately within 20 mins or so! It is ridiculous. I tried charging the device with the original apple charger, even though its of no use. Its still the same. The BATTERY DOESN'T LAST FOR NOT EVEN AN HOUR. This device was actually suggested by one of the amazon customer service representatives. I NEVER TRUST those guys again. NEVER TAKE their suggestions. Please don't get this product. Its WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.
            "
"1744","I bought this iPhone on Nov. last year,however, recently, it has turned off automatically even if the battery had a lot of power! and it usually has no signal with cricket.today,i went to APPLE store to check the problem because the phone cannot turn on anymore!!!Apple staff told me I should pay USD299 to repair it because the seller is not authorized by them and it is out of warranty!!!!  I just use the phone half A year!!!!!!!how can I do now>>>???who is responsible for this>>???I CONTACTed the seller but he said there just has 30 days warranty for this phone!!! WHAT THE HELL??
            "
"1745","The phone requires some tuning for it to grab your carrier's network, and all the help you get is a label that says go to this website and figure it out yourself. It does requiere a fair amount of patience, and when I finally got there, the menu I had to go to is not available because ""the phone has not unlocked"". WHAT?! So that basically means that I cannot do the special tuning and got myself a nice little brick in the shape of an iPhone.Also, the home button dances around its place, when it should be fixed in place.Will give the seller one more chance; I'll call them tomorrow morning to see what they have to say, but most likely this points to be a return.Update: I got an email back from the seller saying nothing more than the equivalent of ""Sorry, bro..."" That was it. Not a single attempt to make it good or to address the issue. Needless to say, I returned the item and Amazon reimbursed me fully.

"1746","good phoneas I expected
            "
"1747","Before reading the bad reviews and considering your option, make sure you are aware of which seller the person bought the phone from. I bought a space grey 16 gb iphone from the seller VIP Outlet and so far the product has been great. I received it in a brown generic box including apple headphones and a charger cable. The phone looks brand new, and has no physical marks. It is functioning as good as a new Iphone, there was no problem switching my carrier over, the only thing I am concerned about is how long the battery life is suppose to run for, but since this is my first I phone I won't consider it a big deal. I recommend buying this product from VIP Outlet if you are considering getting this phone. :)

"1748","Good is ok
            "
"1749","The phone came perfectly good condition. The only two problems I have encountered so far is that you are unable to turn off the camera clicking sound and the battery had to be replaced because it would die at 20% which got annoying when I did not have a portable charger on me.

"1765","The phone was in perfect external conditions. Charger and cable were not genuine, but worked like if they were.The problem was related to wifi and Bluetooth connections. WiFi dropped often and pairing with Applewatch was also inconsistent. I had to return the phone and ask for a refund.

Came with orignal charging etc. now for the juicy part does not come witch headphones also when buying these phones you always have a 50/50 chance of getting a pristine working phone, or a crappy one trust me buy from prime mobility maybe your hard earn money will not be for nothing. I'm happy with my product everything seems to cosmetically fine and functionality is on point. Also for this phone I recommend ESR defender case trust me. Anyway I hope this review help some of you. Don't buying from sellers that don't have at least 700+ comments on there feedback wall

It was fine for two weeks, then all of a sudden the touch screen stopped for half a day, worked fine again, stopped, worked, on and on. Took it to a store and they said the screen was bad, that it would be 120 for a new one. Now I have to wait until they receive my return to get my money back to get another phone. So this left me very sad and inconvenienced.

Not worth the money WHATSOEVER!

"1780","Phone is functional for the most part, but unfortunately it definitely shows signs of being refurbished. I have a case on it, but if I drop it the screen will lift and I have to snap it back in place. The left edge of the screen doesn't always probably either. And it freezes every once in a blue moon. Overall a workable phone, but was hoping to get more like new quality

            "
"1783","Bought a month before Christmas for my 14 year old daughter. She opens it Christmas morning and the phone was locked. After hours running around in snow packed roads we found it was locked at AT&T. We were able to fix the issue but not without being inconvinced. Seller sold this as unlocked.

"1791","The first charge was full to 100%, but when it takes 20% my iPhone just turn off with no reason. Sometimes it works until 1%, sometimes not. I paid for a certified refurbished phone not for a broken one. I am very very desappointed.

"1792","I understand this phone was refurbished but it still didn't work. It couldn't be turned on because if an internal antenna. It looked nice on the outside though. Asked the company for a replacement and received no reply.

"1793","I was slightly skeptical after reading the reviews, but the phone I received was in great condition. Operates as if it is brand new, the battery is the only thing I can kind of critique. It does not last as long as a brand new phone typically would, but they send you a brand new charger that to me makes up for it!
            "
"1794","Works perfectly! I keep forgetting that it's not brand new -- looks, feels, and acts brand new. Would definitely recommend! I had an issue with the charger pod not working but they sent out a replacement in a timely fashion and arrived a day or two later. 10/10
            "
"1795","Was skeptical about buying a refurbished product, but right out the box I noticed the phone was in very good condition, no scratches or dents. The phone itself worked perfectly, didn't have any issues at all. However I would recommend buying a certified Apple charger rather than using the one that is given in with this product.

"1796","The phone seems new. Worked exceptional for 1 full week. In the 2nd week I was encountered with network issues as it failed to find any network. Now I'm forced to return the phone

"1798","Received a refurbished iphone 6 with a complete junk battery. Refurbished means ""in normal working condition"". I had to pay and additional $95 to have an apple store replace battery so it can actually work properly. Was not worth returning item, so i just ate the additional cost. what a joke.
            "
"1799","This item was suppose to be unlocked. The iPhone 6 has a passcode on it and I am able to enter inside the phone. It cost to get it unlocked and I paid for it to be unlocked already on her. I need another iPhone shipped to me that¡¯s unlocked because that¡¯s was I paid for.
            "
"1800","Great product. Just like new, packaging and everything, besides the fact that there are no headphones (which was something I was looking forward to) but still it's a good phone. Works flawlessly haven't had a problem yet.
            "
"1801","Highly don¡¯t recommend, the product had loose screws so it caused the screen to malfunction and either not work sometimes or touch around the screen and click on things when I¡¯m not touching it. Also, at this price you might as well save up a little bit more and buy an unlocked one from apple that will work and last.
            "

            "
"1803","I received my phone today and connected it to MetroPCS. It was in the box and looked brand new. I was worried after reading some reviews of nothing being in the box when it showed up but I did not have that experience. I will update my review if the phone does not work properly but for now I'm giving 5 stars because it got here in 2 days, looks brand new, got it connected with no problem, and is working great.

"1804","Working well, but I am still learning to use it.
            "
"1805","No battery backup , need to keep on charging the phone ,better to take the new phone than factory unlocked n $100 differs tats it
            "
"1806","Overall I love the phone. However, when I went to activate it then it came back as factory locked. I called Apple and they told me that I have to restore it...which is something that the seller should have already done so that it would be ready to use. Everything else about the phone is perfect. There wasn't one scratch or mark, it works perfect. I'm very happy with my purchase.
            "
"1807","The phone came in good but the screen is unresponsive and there are ghost touches. It randomly happen and its annoying. I try everything as to resetting it but that does not work and try holding the power button and home button. Any way its working but the screen is annoying andim planning to take it to apple to fix it.

"1810","The screen quit working after four and a half months of regular use. No longer will the screen respond to touch. No warranty to use either. And it is too large for my personal taste. I felt the 5s had much better design and was less likely to be dropped.
            "
"1811","Was really worried that the product would not be as described. It's literally like a new iPhone! Don't waste your money elsewhere! Sleek, not a scratch or dent anywhere. Buy it!

"1812","Sound button malfunctions and it takes several attempts to get the phone to go on silent or non silent. Sometimes it does it by itself. Also, the screen keeps blinking and ""fake"" dying. I cancelled prime membership when I started having issues with the phone. I just realized that there is a 90 day warranty on the phone, and I would like to get a replacement. What do I do?
            "
"1813","This phone wasn't UNLOCKED as it said so i have to pay for my own way to UNLCOCK IT, a very disapointed because i wanted to use it as fast as i had it, i have no trying the phone but whe i did i will edit this review.
            "
"1814","Very poor quality. Speakers dont work. Battery life aprox. 1-2 hours. Shuts down at 40-50%. Extremely slow performance. Microphones often fail. Need to restart every 3-4 hours. Demand a refund!!!
            "
"1815","got it for my son he loves it,cant put it down.
            "
"1816","Still using my phone till this day and I bought it May 2017 , nice phone , well refurbished, look damn near brand new and salon came in good packaging and with a charger only thing I didn't like was I wanted a pair of ear buds with it :(. But other than that , good job
            "
"1817","When I received the phone, it was dead. Then, after plugging it in, it worked for all of ten minutes before shutting itself off again. It refused to hold a charge and would not stay alive for more than TEN SECONDS. I would not recommend this seller to anyone. This was ridiculous and a terrible experience for me.
            "
"1818","Severe dents in left upper corner. Screen must be replaced before and not properly. Right lower corner of screen is not completely attached to the body of the phone. There is a clicking sound whenever you put any pressure on it. Phone doesn¡¯t activate.
            "
"1819","The phone works properly but there are marks all over it. I expected more even if I know it's a refurbished model.There were stickers near the speakers impossible to remove.Next time I will spend some more and buy a refurbished model directly from Apple itself.
            "
"1820","Looks like new not a single scratch came in a good box and is certified has the 30 day money back which is great every one who says theirs had no phone they lied because Amazon loves it's costomers and gives the full money back so I recommend this phone even their are no risks.
            "
"1821","Perfect condition and came pretty fast. No complaints, especially for the price !
            "
"1822","The volume button did not work, phone kept going off at random times, at random volume levels. Returned the item and have been trying to get a refund, but it's taking FOREVER  for them to ""process"" the paperwork.
            "
"1823","I saved nearly $200 and a lot of tax buying from here. Got an iPhone 6s and it is working perfectly! Looks brand new. The order came in 3 days too. Highly recommend
            "
"1824","The speaker went out after a month . Called to get help. Lady REFUSED to help ! Not happy at all.
            "
"1825","At first I was very skeptical about to this phone And I thought it was too good to be true. I thought I would have needed to get a return but I've had it for 2-3 weeks and it's fully functional well as of now. Hopefully later on it won't cause problems.  Only thing is that the phone was 10 instead of 16 gb<U+0001F644>
            "
"1826","Product was just as listed and in great condition. Also cheaper than if bought in person at the Apple Store so would definitely recommend.
            "
"1827","This phone came just as described and looked brand new---I couldn't find a single scratch or imperfection.  It came with a charger that also looked new.  The packaging was very secure and there was a plastic cover on the phone screen to protect it. So far, so good. I was easily able to insert my T-Mobile SIM card and get right to using it. I would highly recommend!
            "
"1828","Received my certified refurbished Apple Iphone today and its physical condition better than I expected. Turned on immediately with a fully charged battery Keypad clean and functioned properly. I have heard that the Iphone s were having battery problems can't speak on that, haven't had it long enough...keeping my fingers cross

            "
"1836","It came a bit dirty & had fuzz stuff inside the charger port & the headphone jack. Also makes the camera noise when you take a picture weather or not if you turn the volume down. That's about it though, other than that I love it!
            "
"1837","The iPhone was NOT unlocked I am immediately sending back I am SO dissatisfied I can't use it with my t mobile plan
            "
"1838","Phone glass is littlebit scratch n than back site too it looks like old phone
            "
"1839","The price. However, the phone had to be taken to carrier to be open and activated wasn't as simple as taking the sim card from her current iPhone and putting it in this one. Then we had to replace the battery a $75 charge because it was no good. So this was not a good experience.
            "

            "
"1845","Hey, so I usually don't write reviews but I thought that  I should since this a big purse. The phone came in pretty good condition.  The camera works fine. Just be aware of the battery. If you live in a state with cold weather , the phone instantly dies, and turn back on when you're in a warm place. Pretty good purchase overall, just be aware that you might have to change the battery.
            "
"1846","Great iphone
            "
"1847","excellent
            "
"1848","It worked great for a couple of months then started glitching, probably got 2 months out of the purchase.  Have taken to shop 5 times, each time will work for a couple hours after but definately not worth the price.  Phone completely busted now, less then 5 months from the purchase.
            "
"1849","This product never functioned properly, it refused to recognize my fingerprint, would not allow me to input information..
            "
"1850","Definitely recommend even though a bit pricy
            "
"1851","The phone came without original charger and without earphones. Instead, they included a $1 store charger and you need to charge your phone for hours to get to 100%.Battery died after 3 weeks, now have to buy a new battery. Don¡¯t buy it from this seller !
            "
"1852","look like use (old)

"1856","Phone took five hours on the charger to turn on. Now it will charge to 100% and dies within 10 minutes of using it. Have to plug it into the charger to turn back on then dies all over again. Not sure how they¡¯re considering what they sell refurbished
            "
"1857","Great product; as expected!!!!!!
            "
"1858","Hi this iPhone bought it as unlocked en i can not use it. I request that it be unlocked in order to  use it.Thank you.

"1860","Good
            "
"1861","like it
            "
"1862","Don't buy anything from ""dealfisher"".iPhone screen doesn't respond to touch, I literally have to turn off the screen and turn it back on in order for it to work.
            "
"1863","Paid 327.00 and received a phone that would not charge or work. Will not buy from this seller again.
            "
"1864","Had many scratch. So Returned the phone.
            "
"1865","Not working properly. phone is getting switched off over and over even with 60% of battery.
            "
"1866","The screen is damaged on the phone.
            "
"1867","I'm quite disappointed with this. I'm aware of the risks that come with refurbished electronics, but to sell a product with a clear problem in the touch ic chip, knowing said problem can't be fixed, is terrible. So I've pretty much tanked $400 on a phone that's just steadily getting worse and can't be repaired.
            "
"1868","I couldn't hear voice when you are on the phone. So I had to return it.
            "
"1869","i think the battery was damaged before, after i used one month, when my phone charge, it restart over and over again and i can not use it anymore. worst phone - -
            "
"1870","The left side of the touch does not work at times. I am going to return it.
            "
"1871","I got this iphone in October,2015 which looked good when I got it. But after 8 months, my phone got turned off overnight and its not turning on.Seller is saying that item is out of warranty.But personally I have not heard of this kind of issue in iphones.
            "
"1872","Right from the start this ""certified refurbished""  phone was often unresponsive and frequently froze up. The only way to revive it was to do a hard power-off and reboot it, and even that only worked some of the times. I returned the phone and three weeks later got a replacement, which was even worse: I could not even activate it, as it was frozen from the start. Some on-line research has revealed that this problem is common with the iPhone 6: it is a design problem that has been labeled ""Touch Disease"". Apparently the touch chips on the logic board often partially break off and you get intermittent electrical connections. I'll have to take it to an Apple store and see what they can do about it.
            "
"1873","Great product picked one day shipping and got the package right away. Only thing is that Facetime and imessage wont activate for me. Either than that the phone is great
            "
"1874","Like it's fresh out the Apple Store.
            "
"1875","Worked great!!
            "
"1876","I just bought this phone and its seems to be that battery is drained. It only lasts a couple of hours (mainly in standby).I'm trying some configuration hints, but almost for sure I'll return the product.
            "
"1877","It came faulty, scratches and with the screen a little loose. I bought in my trip to Usa, so now is impossible to ask for a refund. Avoid this ""refurbished"" stuff!
            "
"1878","I was skeptical, but the product came in pristine condition. There were no scratches or even a mark.
            "
"1879","At $400, the price for this is great. My phone came in amazing condition <U+2013> battery seems good, no dings, chips or scratches. What could go wrong? Well¡¦ the phone is still locked.  Prior to purchasing this I had read people having similar experiences, but was hoping I¡¯d be one of the lucky ones.  I wasn¡¯t.So if you¡¯re thinking about buying this (say from Pangea Deals) you¡¯re rolling the dice. I¡¯ve seen reviews were everything was great, some where the phone was terrible, some where it¡¯s still locked.
            "
"1880","Phone works as expected.

"1964","Device has a bad battery. The first time, it took over 2 hours just to turn on. Kept it charging all night long and then the following day, it turned off at 45%. It wouldn't turn on, so I held the Power+Home button and it turned on showing I had 10% charge. It turned off right after and I repeated the process. Now, it shows 50% charge. There's clearly a calibration issue or the battery is defective. How is this a ""certified-refurbished"" unit?! I would like to replace this instead of getting a refund, but i'm afraid that I will get a similar unit that's defective as well. Listen to this review and many others & DO NOT BUY THIS.

"1996","I read all the reviews and all the people that had trouble with their purchases. I was a little scared to spend 300$ and get a stole phone, or a damaged phone. But I was really desperate for a new phone so I bought it. My phone came in within 2-3 days of me buying it. I was extremely satisfied my phone was working perfectly looked brand new and I absolutely loved it. I bought this phone in may of 2017 and I am writing this in December 2017 I waited a couple months to see if I had any trouble and I didn't have a single problem in the last 8 months. Don't believe the other reviews trust me it is a good buy.

"2001","The speed of the phone, camera, condition etc. is next to new quality. What knocks it down is the area of the phone where the ""T"" key is located on the keyboard is extremely unresponsive. Nearly every time I try to type a ""T"" it types a ""R"" or a ""Y"" instead and needless to say it has become very frustrating. Like, extremely frustrating to the point where I avoid words with ""T's"" in them.

After calling Apple and then AT&T (who Apple told me was the carrier my phone was locked to), AT&T was able to unlock the phone for me in a few hours... but I was one of the lucky ones! If the previous phone owner had not respected their contract AT&T would have refused to unlock the phone...

"2038","Thanks was great buy. Looking forward to doing more business with you
            "
"2039","This is strictly a product review as the seller was very expeditious and professional. The design and features are as good as expected for a company as successful as Apple. However, I was extremely disappointed when, after a few days having the phone, dropped it and the screen shattered to the point where it just didn't work. It wasn't thrown or dropped fromy very high. So, durability is nowhere near where it should be. This was my first iPhone, coming from a long time Samsung user. Needless to say, I went back with Samsung(GS6 edge) and am just disappointed that I wasted the money on the iPhone. Apple can't say I didn't give them a chance, however, back to the practical smart phone for me.

"2056","So far, I've had this phone for about three months now, so I think I clean leave a clear review of it.I've been a fan of refurbished products, mostly because they're made sure that they work well. On the down side.. there might be a few scratches or light damage.When I received the phone, it had a few scratches towards the left bottom side of the phone, but I didn't mind. What I cared about, was the software. Soon as I turned that baby on, I was in love.Since then, the iPhone has been working perfectly. So if you don't mind light damages/scratches, this would be the product for you.

"2058","Only worked for 5 days before it completely broke. The creen starts flickering black and white checkers, lines, and boxes. For the first 3 days, I could just reset it and it would be good as new but after day 4 I can't even get the screen to clear of the glitch. Extremely disappointed I spent so much on something that didn't even last a week. Don't waste your money.

"2061","I bought five of these for my family all around two years ago. All of them have issues with the power adapter. One of them had just come off of AppleCare and the Genius told me that I had several bent or broken prongs in the adapter. They say that dirt gets into the slot from being in your pocket or purse and then when we plugin to charge they bend. The also told me that different prongs are used to charge from a computer versus a wall charger and also to communicate with a PC.  During the life of my devices I kept buying chords thinking it was the chord going bad but turns out it's the adapters.Also Apple seems to believe in planned obsolescence because they have no option to fix. They said if it was the battery they would fix for $80 but bent prongs cannot be fixed and their only remedy is to buy another iPhone 6 for $365. They also said other than cracked screens this is the most common problem.The iPhone 7 even puts the headphones through this jack making the design flaw even more of a problem because it's using more of these prongs.If you bought AppleCare definitely go in for a free power adapter test where they check each prong before apple care expires and you can get a new phone. They told me it's extremely common to find at least one issue with a 2 year old phone so this seems to be a way you can get your phone replaced. I wish I had known as my issue appeared literally weeks after AppleCare expired and they would not honor.What's ironic is my iPhone 2, 3, and 4 old phone charging port works fine. These no longer get IOS updates from apple but I long for the days when apple meant quality
            "
"2062","If you actually use this phone to make phone calls and you do so via the Bluetooth in your car. Do not get this phone.I had an iPhone 6 and it worked flawlessly. I connected my new iPhone 7 and it started dropping the Bluetooth connect while making calls immediately.I've done everything apple told me to do. Didn't work. Did an online search of the problem and lots of people have the same issue.So now I'm stuck with a phone that doesn't work.So this will be my last apple product.

"2063","The phone that I received was horrible! Did a master rest twice and still the phone would freeze and respond to touch. STILL HAD THE LOCATION INFORMATION IN IT FROM THE PREVIOUS OWNER! Junk!

"2064","Bought the iPhone 6 to use for work. It showed 169 + FREE SHIPPING and also noted BRAND NEW. Was very excited because BRAND NEW IPHONE 6 for 169 is a steal. So phone arrived 4 days after. After opening the phone, it was a complete junk. Whole Back of the phone was filled with scratches and the screen was popping off. IT WAS LISTED AS CERTIFIED REFURBISHED!!!! the phone is the refurbished not brand new. Would recommend amazon to publish the ad as used-very used. LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE CHILD USED IT. VERY DISSATISFIED
            "
"2065","From what i can see the IP6 was in activation lock and it was bypassed from a hard factory reset. [ look at top left screen of phone in video displayed] it says [log in] meaning the phone will turn on but will be locked and will need a bypass to be operational.
            "
"2066","I was really scared to waste all this money on this phone. I read all the reviews and was praying for mine not to come like that. I bought it and everything was fine. Don't listen to the bad reviews. It does come unlocked and works with family mobile. The only problem with the phone was it didn't come with the original headphone set and charger, but I don't care for that. The thing I care about the most was the sims card. The phone is unlocked but it only takes nano sims cards. So I had to cut my micro sims card down to a nano sims card. I was really scard to cut it but I took a chance and it ended up working. I'm very pleased with the purchase and I know you will be too.
            "
"2067","Your phone is trash. Don¡¯t sell the phone if you know it¡¯s a piece of junk. Don¡¯t buy this phone. It has many problems. Your wasting your time and money I recommend going to the real apple store even a the first Samsung is better than this don¡¯t buy

"2068","I purchased this phone for my mom and one day, the screen turned black and it was never responsive again. This was less than 3 months after activating the phone. I contacted the seller several times and they kept telling me the warranty is expired that I have to go to local repair store. Went to a mac repair store as well as the apple store. Both told me it is a hardware problem and not fixable. The only option is to buy a new phone. Again, seller not responsive to complaints, despite offering to send it back for them to evaluate. Don't make the same mistake and spend $350 on a defective product that only lasts less than 3 months.

"2070","I purchased an iPhone 6 from a Verizon store. I have had this phone for the past 2 years and it has stayed in great condition. While I have dropped my phone several times over the past 2 years, it has never once cracked or had any issues. This product has been very sturdy, and I have not had any need to upgrade to a newer model. I can download and use just as many apps as owners with newer models can. This phone was worth the price that I paid for it. Many people with the same phone have complained about the battery life fading as the phone gets older but I have yet to experience it. This is not just for the phone I have, there was recently a case of Apple shortening the life of a battery to require customers to buy newer products. However, my phone works just as well as it did when I first got it.  I use my phone for so many different things, both for leisure and for academic uses. I use it to submit assignments when I am away from my laptop. I can stream movies off it and the lag depends on the WIFI I am connected to. I play games on it when I have time to kill. I am also an avid reader, so I can buy books and read them digitally on my phone. I would highly recommend this product to everyone. It has works very well, if it is taken care of, and would be a very useful tool. My phone is very important to me because there is important information inside. This product is well made and I feel more comfortable with it than the other models.

"2071","I love this phone. It¡¯s exactly what I wanted I have had an iPhone 6 for years but with all the updates to the system most of my memory was getting taking up just to make sure the phone worked.

Struggles and freezes when trying to perform basic tasks like selecting something on the touchscreen, struggles to load safari with no other apps running, struggles with every function it should be able to perform. If you want a slow phone that cannot perform basic tasks this is the perfect phone for you.

"2176","BOTTOM LINE:  THREE PHONES ALL DEFECTIVE.Ordered two phones.  One would not connect with the network so ended up returning and getting another.  The replacement came and connected intermittently with the network.  Having to replace it.  The other phone worked except the camera lens on the front of the camera is not aligned with the window, so the pictures are blurry.  Also, if you squeeze slightly on the phone near the lens, it clicks indicating something is not attached correctly.
            "
"2177","This iPhone 6 arrived quickly and on time. I was nervous to open it, as other reviewers found less than satisfactory condition with theirs. But this one looks absolutely brand new.It functions like new as well. No glitches in two weeks of use. I'm VERY satisfied with this purchase.
            "
"2178","Phone seemed fine, has a small wave on the side, min scratching, but nothing major at all.However battery is very weak, does not hold a charge (must leave plugged in and even then the battery most of the time does not have enough of a charge to turn on). At first there was no issue with the battery, except it ran down pretty quickly. As the days goes by, the faster it ran down, and the more it wouldnt keep it charge.Bought in the end of June, shipped in early July. Received within the wk I am sure (didnt look to see when received). In just 90 days the battery life dropped very quickly to where most of the time it wont even turn on when plugged in charging.Apple store will not touch said item and the gentleman they see this enough supposedly everyone is informed at it in their stores and told not to touch at all. He claimed the products used inside the phone is not apple approved parts (after market parts). He also claims this is false advertising to claim it is certified refurbished (he did state its more misleading as ppl assume when seeing certified refurbished they believe its apple approved, where it is actually only certified by another company). He further told me most of these phones sold usually have issues right before or after the warrantee, the 90 days.Do not get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with after market products. If the seller notices such as with this case, numerous ppl having major issues with the phones being sold right around the 90 day mark, they should as sellers demand those working on them to pay attention to details, use a different supplier for the after market products or extend their warrantee. This is would be good customer service which in turns brings in more customers.I would not recommend purchasing this at all, but if you want too, purchase the additional coverage. 98% chance you will need it right around the 90 day mark.By the way what is up with sending play dough to some customers? At least make it glittery play dough, or unicorn play dough..........
            "
"2179","Not compatible with metro pcs or T-Mobile network,don't waste your time and money on buying this.
            "
"2180","These phones are terrible.The phone never goes to silent mode.Also every time my son tried to listen to music with his headphones it opens Siri.I can use my Amazon SD card IPhone adapter to view photos on ANY OTHER IPhone or Android, but it only worked twice on my pathetic phone.Of course, I didn't start having problems with it until after the 90 day limited warranty.These phones turned out to be worthless very quickly
            "
"2181","So far so good!  This is an authorized refurbished dealer so it comes with a 90 day warranty. Shipped very quickly and received it in days in perfect condition.
            "
"2182","DONT WASTE YOUR TIME....From the day of delivery this phone hasn¡¯t work. I install my SIM card and the service doesn¡¯t not last more than a minute.  Both service providers SIM card I put in this phone and it¡¯s the same thing. I will be returning this phone and requesting a full refund.
            "
"2183","Despite claiming to be refurbished, my daughter had it for three days before the battery would be at 100%, then plummet to 20%, then switch itself off. It would turn itself back on, and stand at 12%, and drop again. This would happen until it was 'out of juice', despite having supposedly been fully charged just moments earlier. Appears to be a faulty battery, which is disappointing for a refurbished phone.
            "
"2184","I did not expect perfection for a refurbished phone and didn't get it here. There were minor flaws, such as minor scratches on the screen but as far as performance goes, this was a very good deal. The minor flaws were hardly noticeable when I put a mirrored screen protector and put it in a protective case. No one would have suspected that this was a refurbished iPhone. I am happy with this purchase and recommend it to anyone looking for a good phone at a really good price.
            "
"2185","I read other reviews about the battery on the refurbished phone not holding a charge or the charge runs out fast. I figured it was a couple of bad batteries and they had fixed the problem. WRONG!I¡¯m on my second full charge of the day and it¡¯s at 50% right now. I¡¯m in a bind because I could send it back, but I won¡¯t have a phone through the process. And, I can¡¯t wipe the data to send it back without transferring data to another iPhone. This is what happens when you try to save a buck.
            "
"2186","This phone was sold to me as ""certified refurbished"", and yet when I took it to the Apple Store (for a myriad of problems) just under the 3-month mark of owning it, they told me that the battery could never have been lightly used when I bought the phone, as it has over 1,000 charge cycles on it, and I would only have been able to accrue 80-150 in three months. This phone was sold to me with a battery that was already past its lifespan! This was clearly NOT refurbished, and yet sold as such. I would like to return this, but it is past its return date. They should have a ""discovery of fabrication"" date for returns as well.
            "
"2187","like new! this is my first refurbished iphone purchase and I couldnt be happier!
            "
"2188","Worked great with my SIM card setting up was just like setting up a new phone. It looked like a brand new phone no scratches on sight even had it's original plastic and did come with off brand charger  only issue I personally had was that I forgot how small 16 gb was. I returned it because I wanted to get the 6s not the 6. Other than that no complaints
            "
"2189","Battery came in needing to be serviced. My screen randomly hits other buttons and types in random stuff where it thinks I¡¯m touching the screen and I¡¯m not. Everything crashes and freezes. This is a very frustrating waste of money! I was hoping by spending this much money I would get a semi-decent phone but no this phone looks good on the outside and works like crap on the inside. Don¡¯t trust it!
            "
"2190","This is more of a dealer review than the phone. Product is fine with very minor scratches typical for a 4 year old phone. What is also typical is battery life. It drains very quickly in the cold. I went to Apple Store and had a diagnostic test which showed that battery has reached end of life to hold charge. The replacement cost is $29 by Apple Store in house. Dealer refused to meet this expense, instead opted for a prepaid, full refund to have the phone. I simply don't understand the policy of picking up the cost of return shipping, restocking the phone...... to sell to the next unsuspecting customer. I find this practice unethical.So buy it and you have to add $29 to the cost.
            "
"2191","This refurbished iPhone has so far, lived to expectations. The screen quality is good and so is the touch screen. As I¡¯ve just bought it a few weeks, I cannot say much for the battery life. An Apple product - new or, as in this case, bought refurbished through amazon - can always be relied on to perform at the capacity and quality claimed in the product¡¯s literature.
            "
"2192","Worked fine after I replaced the battery.  Pros don't know if the total failure was mechanical or software.  First experience with a ""refurbished"" phone so I don't have much confidence with these ""certified"" inspectors.
            "
"2193","<U+00A0>The screen was loose in the top corners. I am not sure how that it is considered to be a certified refurbished phone. I ordered a replacement after calling the seller and the second phone had different issues. I took my business elsewhere.

"2199","There's lots of dents and scratches on back (glass is clean and without issues).. Looks heavily used or fallen down pretty badly.Interface looks sketchy (fonts are different.. Some of the headings are misaligned than regular iPhone) and seems more like jailbroken than unlocked.Functionalities are all working fine including fingerprint. So far so good. Not very happy about the purchase.

"2200","battery life... less than 4 hours at normal use. it turns off and then on many times per day without any reason not even a warning message... and last but not least unless you turn on the speaker you cannot hear a thing.  how can we fix this?
            "
"2201","Had phone for little over month.  No real complaints other than the battery life. With normal daily usage, phone will die within3 hours. I had to purchase a mophie case and a portable charger to make up for the fast draining battery.Buying a refurbished phone, I wasn¡¯t expecting a brand new phone so I¡¯m not too bothered by this.Overall the phone is nice.  Just a few scratches on back and dying battery
            "
"2202","Bought on dec 2017, now not even a year later the batter is fried and the screen is also bad the Y key, V Key and C key don¡¯t work and the screen has two red lines that run down the phone.

"2207","The phone was easily added to our Verizon account.  It looked brand new.  Screen is clear.  Battery life seems ok.  A couple times it has gone dead in a short period of time but that may be something we were running and not realizing.  My husband just needed something for texting and phone calls so he is very happy with it.
            "
"2208","I¡¯m really not to familiar with this type of phone but if you buy one save yourself some money for a battery that holds up because this one absolutely Sucks! I have had to charge my phone normally 3 to 4 times a day at work in a 8 hour period. It had a full charge last night before I went to bed and 17% in the morning at 4:00 am come on now!

(Minor issue so I didn't complain) now all of a sudden barely holds a charge. Out of nowhere it gets really HOT and shutdowns I'm without a phone for hours. Comes back on when it wants to sometimes that can take a full day. Now I am kind of skeptical of refurbished anything. Not really wanting refurbished items again anymore.

One is that it was supposed to be 16 GB but when I got it , it was only 11 GB :( that really upset me + I had to waste like 1 GB to update the phone . The other thing I don't like is that if the phone is at 100% I, it dies in 5 hours. 20% only lasts 1 hour . That sucks for me. I've been working with this phone for 2 or 3 weeks and it's perfectly fine besides those 2 issues. Other then that I love it !<U+2764><U+FE0F>

"2281","Good Product. Good Quality.
            "
"2282","The phone's WiFi is bad, likely an antenna problem. I tested with other iPhone 6 and a 5, side by side, and this one will not show the SSIDs for the access point that I needed to connect once I was 20 feet away with line of sight, however, the other ones did fine. And when connected, performance was underpar, and will lose the connection easily. All the other phones worked fine in the same context. Phone was without a case also. I'm a tech savvy guy and explored all possible paths around this, measure throughput, etc. All came down the same conclusion.This seller seems to do zero quality control on what they sell and should be avoided. However, Amazon was great about returning the product.
            "
"2283","The phone came with a few scratches which is expected but where you turn the ringer off you can see the light shine through. It gets really annoying at times. But hey its refurbished.
            "

"2285","This is the best phone I ever had. I used to have the iPhone 5 but this is the iPhone 6 so its 1 better
            "
"2286","I ordered my phone and had one day shipping with it and all that was fine. When I got the phone everything was as expected. Then I got a call and when I tried talking to them, they said there was a lot of noise in the background, but there was no noise on my end or in my background. So I called a few more people and Everyone said the same thing, so I had to hear it for my self, and it was horrible. Currently I am returning it. The phone is in the mail. Basically it sucks paying that much money for a faulty phone and I would've been ok with just exchanging for another phone but all they could do is give me my money back or amazon credit (which isn't bad but I've already been through that process of searching for a phone).
            "

Did not include headphones which I did not expect nor need.  Phone was immaculate so far as I can see.  No scratches, dents, etc.  Looked new.Today, I took the ATT sim card out of my S7 and put it in the iPhone.  No issues to activate so far.  Wifi worked.  Cellular worked although I had to restart device in order to get LTE connection.  No funny messages yet reported by others.  Checking battery life as I started at 100% and when done with the software update and activation, down to 88%.  Put it on low power setting to maximize battery life now.More later.

"2457","This phone is really awful. I understand it¡¯s refurbished, but the battery does not last more than an hour. Sometimes it will be at 30%, then shut off and not turn back on until it gets plugged in.

"2480","iPhone is damaged. Don¡¯t buy with this seller. Microphone is not working, which makes this phone useless.

"2493","Great condition. Only miss is battery life.. Works with Metro pcs.
            "
"2494","I'm actually writing this review on the iPhone 6 I bought here. It works absolutely FANTASTIC. It is fast, looks new, and is everything the description said. However, I thought it would be useful for others to know that this does not come with a SIM card. I didn't know this, and I had to go get one at Smith's (about $20). If you have a SIM card already, it shouldn't be a problem. I just didn't have one, and had to buy one in order to set up the phone.
            "
"2495","Often the screen doesn¡¯t work. I¡¯m sorry I spent the money on this product.
            "

            "
"2506","Excellent Product! Recommended!
            "
"2507","the round button on the bottom didnt work well.  I was leaving for Europe the next day so I couldn't send it back.
            "
"2508","I've had it for about 3 months now.  I was worried it wouldn't work properly or there'd be some issue with switching to this phone but it's been good. When I first started using it, it did used to restart at random moments but that only lasted for a few days and stopped without me doing anything to it. Charger has been working really well also. Doesn't come with earphones or anything but that's okay because I prefer to use the Jabra talk Bluetooth headset anyway (I know this review isn't about that but boy has using Bluetooth made my life easier! I can hear all sounds coming from my phone like music/calls/videos and I can be across the room at the same time)
            "
"2509","Works great!  It should be clearer from the website which carrier this was originally for.  You had to dig a lot to find out that it was a Verizon phone.  Great phone at great price, though.
            "
"2510","Shuts off
            "
"2511","Working great, but please make sure that the carrier drops it at the right location!

"2537","3/15/17--This arrived on time and well packaged. So far this has been in great shape. I purchased for my daughter as a major upgrade. It had only minor scratches on the back,otherwise, it has been a month now and has been working flawlessly.  Given some of the reviews of a refurbished phone I am worried that it could stop at any time but it hasn't. So far very pleased.
            "
"2538","Works fine. Set up service in Canada for the 2 weeks I am here. I am planning too set it up in the US when I get back.

"2540","TOTALMENTE UNA FARSA Y UN ROBOEstos telefonos no funcionan, tienen problemas en la tarjeta madre, en lo personal fui a un servicio tecnico autorizado y me dijeron que JAMAS debi haber comprado ese telefono ya que habia sido reportado con un grave problema y lo que me vendieron solo era una carcasa pues no lo utilice ni tres meses y no reconocia la tarjeta sim para despues reiniciarse automaticamente cada dos minutos.TOTALLY A FARSE AND A ROBBERYThese phones do not work, they have problems in the motherboard, I personally went to an authorized technical service and they told me that I should NEVER have bought that phone since it had been reported with a serious problem and what they sold me was only a case I use it for three months and it did not recognize the sim card and then automatically restart it every two minutes. WASTE OF MONEY
            "

"2545","It is working perfectly.
            "
"2546","The phone was in great condition but it was made in a way that there was no way to mute the shutter sound on the camera and that was surely a deal breaker for me. Hopefully the next phone does not have this issue.

            "
"2591","The packing was not good...came in a plastic Cover which looked old...scratches on phone and no documents.
            "
"2592","If I could put zero stars I would. I received this phone January 2, 2018 and spent $264. Here it is February 20, 2018 and the phone died.  It won't turn on or anything.  Even brought it to AT&T and there's nothing we can do.  Can't find an email to contact the seller either.  Money down the drain.
            "
"2593","This phone has no scratches what so ever. There is a tiny dent by the volume buttons but other than that, it looks and runs like a brand new iphone! I recommend this for sure!
            "
"2594","Phone just as described. Though it didn't come with OEM packaging, but it looks brand new and no scratch both screen and back of phone. Thanks guys am enjoying my phone
            "
"2595","Great
            "
"2596","Sometimes it gets hang!
            "
"2597","Defective phone
            "
"2598","looks very nice, camera is great, battery lasts a long time.  BUT since I got it a couple days ago, it's started to act like I'm opening apps or typing things when I'm not touching it, and, separately, not responding to the things I am actually trying to do.  I took off the protective glass screen cover I've had on it since the beginning to see if that was the problem, but no.  It also, every time I unlock it, asks ""Do you want to enable automatic downloads on this device"" which I don't particularly, but since it didn't give me options other than ""yes"" or ""cancel"" and hitting cancel just meant I would gt the same notification again next time I unlocked the phone, I figured I might as well, if only to stop the notification.  but it won't let me enable automatic downloads.  When I move the slider to yes, it stays there for half a second and then slides back to no.  Very frustrating.  I will be returning this phone and buying something else.
            "
"2599","One extremely small scratch on the bottom that's almost invisible. Literally the only problem. Obviously don't expect an apple charger or apple head phones but the charger provided works just fine. I've had this phone for about a month now. Love it! I bought from seller Breed that I did research on and they have a 99% rating.
            "
"2600","It was very slow for no reason and it is glitching a lot. I bought this for my mom but she is complaining about it. I think I might have been scammed idk
            "
"2601","Works like new
            "
"2602","It has been great, exactly as described arrived in good shape. Recently I have bought phones that come packed for a garage sale, dirty etc. not the case w/this phone, works just like an iPhone should. Thanos
            "
"2603","Excellent service of delivery. The phone is ok.
            "
"2604","While this is indeed an unlocked iPhone, it is the Japanese version, and therefore the camera shutter sound CANNOT be turned off, unless you do some jailbreaking which we were not prepared to do.  It is unfortunate that the description doesn't mention this anywhere.  The phone was awesome, either new, or virtually so, although it came with a non-Apple charger.  The shipping was exactly as promised, the customer service was quick when I wanted to return, it's just a shame that the phone isn't quite as advertised.
            "
"2605","It seems great so far.  We purchased as a gift and were disappointed in the presentation.  Protective shields slapped on sloppily with tons of air bubbles, changer in a plastic bag.  No ear buds.  We added a protective shield to the glass and added new ear buds.  The packaging did seem sturdy enough though and the product seems fine.  Just don't expect it to show up in all of it's original Apple glory!
            "
"2606","Arrived in great condition. No scratches or dings. I have heard this with many refurbished phones and it stands true with this one the battery is not great. It does last most of the day but does almost immediately if you open any apps once the battery gets to 30%. Also dies quickly if it gets cold (my old iPhone did this too). Overall for the price I am very happy
            "
"2607","This phone is most likely from Japan (they have laws requiring the shutter noise) as I cannot disable the camera shutter noise!! I can work around it by using Instagram in silent mode, but I was not warned before buying the product.The phone is in great shape otherwise. You don't realize how big of an inconvenience not being able to disable the shutter is until you try to Snapchat. Alas, a first world problem... So, I am happy I have a phone!

"2608","The phone is great. I have it set up as a tracfone. Getting the Data working was a bit of pain. God bless them, but tracfone support are helpless when it comes to B.Y.O.phone. Turns out that to get the data to work you have to set up the A.P.N and M.M.C.S on an i-phone 6 but i.O.S will not let you manually adjust the settings. The link tracfone provides for setting up this profile Did Not Work, for me at any rate. After a lot of google research I discovered this app that sets it up for you, Unlockit.co.nz it worked like a dream. Now I have phone and data. I already had a tracfone log in so all I had left to do was down load the tracfone app from the app store so I could monitor my available minutes, s.m.s and data.I hope this helps others avoid a lot of frustration. Oh, and straight talk is basically tracfone so this might help those users as well.The phone itself looks brand new as far as I can tell. No scratches or ware and tare of any kind. No ear buds (as expected) but it did come with the wall charger and lighting to USB cable. Call clarity has improved (compared to i-phone 4) and Siri can be useful at times. I have also used the google maps navigation app and it is an adequate replacement for a stand alone GPS.I highly recommend getting some kind of cover/case. You don't really need a screen protector thanks to gorilla glass, but you will regret dropping this phone as the corners will show impacts. It is a slippery little devil, it almost jumps out of your hand like the ""precious"" thing it is.I think the size is just right and the ""reach"" feature is helpful. The only thing that would be better is battery life, and for the love of god let me expand the memory. This is the primary reason it only rates 4 stars.

"2609","The screen I got is bad...terrible screen it's moving while I use it...returned it but the returns are good..with a nice customer service.

"2610","This is a great phone aside for the fact i have had it for less than 24 hours and the phone can't hold a charge after speaking with apple support i now have to go into the apple store a get the battery replaced for $80! Yeah $80 isn't a lot but the fact that in the description the phone was listed as ""like new"" to me that should mean that the battery is fully functioning! So now i have to go shell out more money for the battery to be replaced yeah not happy will not order from this dealer again!

"2614","WARNING DO NOT BUY this item!!! Save yourself the headache and frustration from buying this phone!It came water DAMAGED with a BIG red spot on the left side of the screen. The packaging it came in looked getto and beyond used..
            "
"2615","I was concerned about ordering a refurbished phone. But there were only 2 very small abrasions on the entire phone. The phone runs great and works as a iPhone should. My only regret is that I didn't look at the iPhone SE As I prefer the smaller 4 inch display. It's also faster and has better overall specs than the 6 and it was only $65 more. But if you prefer the larger display then I would recommend this. No problems with my AT&T SIM card, just popped it in before I turned the phone on and it worked just fine.
            "
"2616","I'm sorry I was the one who bought this product. I couldn't use it. I couldn't save any contact,  send a text,  take a picture and many other things.  The only thing I could do was to place a call. Please don't sale stuff like that.
            "
"2617","The outside looked like new. No complaints here.  I had to do factory restore a couple of time because it did not want to start. Now that the warranty is expired, the phone is totally dead. I kept the software updated and the battery was charged. What can I say... I'm very disappointed.
            "
"2618","I brought this phone for my son it said it was NEW NOT AT ALL IT HAD SCRATCHES AND NICKS AND IT DIDNT COME WITH EARBUDS JUST A CHARGER AND EVERYWHERE ELSE YOU GET A CHARGER AND EARBUDS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED!

"2619","I read through the reviews after I had bought this so I was scared when I received it but I haven't had any problems what so ever (using the phone to write this review)Didn't have a problem with it being damaged (looks brand new)No issue with transferring SIM cards/ serviceDo not regret buy this item!

"2622","My daughter needed a new phone and AT&T was going to charge a fortune, even though her phone was several years old. So far so good. We also purchased an extended warranty.  Phone arrived quickly and in perfect condition

"2623","so many negative reviews idk why the best 289 I ever spent
            "
"2624","Great price, shipping and service! Thank you will buy again
            "
"2625","First of all, the Phone does not come equiped with the tool used to open the port, so i had to use a paperclip, second the nano sim card that I put in from Verizon worked well with my Android, but when I put it in this phone, lines started appearing and the screen was unresponsive. This is a bad product do not my this!
            "
"2626","I am very dissatisfied with this product and the sellers responsiveness to the request for support. I have called 4 times, they returned 1 call with a voicemail.....I do NOT recommend!
            "
"2627","I really hate buying ""refurbished"" things for this very reason: they're always defective in some way or another. My iPhone resets multiple times a day and it's an absolute waste of money. I was cautious to buy it because all the one star reviews. Just know this: if you buy this, prepared to have a 50/50 chance that is doesn't work.
            "
"2628","Great phone
            "
"2629","The charging port was defective
            "
"2630","the camera shutter will not mute when switched to silent and it always shutters at the loudest volume, ridiculous! Will probably return because they should disclose this feature, which is made for Japan etc and can be very much obnoxious, scaring the cat and waking up the dog next door by snapping a photo
            "
"2631","I really research how to buy a used iPhone 6. I chose amazon because at least then I I knew the company had been vetted for reliability. So far, so good. Phone works great!
            "
"2632","Although I hated the idea of getting an Apple phone, I do love its functionality. I would definitely buy it again, if I could get it at a reasonable price.
            "
"2633","I was cautious buying a used phone. Arrived in great condition and my son has been using it for a month or two now and no problems. I'd recommend this.

"2638","We received the phone yesterday, and it is in perfect condition. We took it to the T-Mobile sort store last night and had it activated onto our account without any issues. It is as promised, and we are very satisfied so far. The battery far surpasses the poor 5C my husband held onto for too long!

"2641","Would give no stars but to rate you have to it that . Less than 30 days out of the minimum warranty. I now own a $350 paperweight. Did the update as requested and now it won¡¯t even turn on . Junk. This actually replaced the 1st one ... should have known! Save your money and look elsewhere!
            "
"2642","It doesn't work with my husband's at&t chip. It turned on and everything but no service. We thought it was at&t but they said his service is active and working so I'm very disappointed and would like a solution to this.

"2643","Seller was awful (BUYSpry). Terrible customer support. Didn't want to provide refund even though it was still in the refund window. Phone was trash (broken screen, battery lasted 30 minutes). Amazon pulled through, as usual and provided the refund for them.

            "
"2650","Returned this phone once - bought again and returned the second one. Will not be buying a third from this seller.1st phone - came in good packaging with a very cheap charger. The body of the phone had deep gray scratches in it, which I could deal with. However, then I noticed the camera wouldn't focus. Upon further inspection I found there was a dead pixel AND what looked to be a hair trapped in the lens. Deal breaker - returned it and was refunded without hassle.2nd phone - thought maybe I had just gotten a bad phone with the first and tried again. Second was in much better condition with an apple brand charger - no scratches or camera issue. Then I found I couldn't mute the shutter sound when taking a photo. After troubleshooting I realized this camera must have been refurbished from another country like Japan where it is illegal to silence the camera noise. Only way to get rid of this is to do some next-level hacking, which is out of my skill range and technically illegal. This foreign refurbishment was NOT disclosed and is also a deal breaker. Returning this phone and will hopefully have no issues..

"2680","My phone came in awesome condition. It says that is a refurbished phone, but it came to me like a brand new phone. The only thing I didn't like was that it was packaged inside of a small zip lock type thing inside of a big box, and it wasn't protected inside of bubble wrap. Everything else was perfect the sound works good, the videos play well, and it works completely fine. Thanks to everyone who had great reviews to push me to get mine.

"2683","An excellent product. It arrived on time, in a new box, unlocked and worked very well. There were a few small blemishes, but that is to be expected with a refurbished product. The home button sticks on occasionally that was easily fixed with rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) on a cotton swab, applied to the home button with the phone turned off, lightly tapped for 30 seconds, and then let sit for 5 minutes. I live in East Africa, and this phone works perfectly well using the local cell phone carrier.

"2693","Received this phone, got it activated and loaded with all pictures, contacts, videos, etc.  Stopped working after 2 days.  Took it into Apple hoping to restart it and was told the hardware was faulty and could not be fixed. Returned for refund.  Also realized we could purchase a brand new phone for only $30 more.
            "
"2694","Disaster.  The phone's reception was terrible and it had a short battery life.  On top of that, the charger broke after a week with the phone saying that it wasn't a certified charger.  The problem with cheap charger is that it kills your battery (or so they say).  So, all those suspicious glowing reviews may not be happy after 6 months.Ok, so after all that I return it and, using my tracking number, I see that they received it.  Then I waited for a refund, but it never came.  I contact them and they said that I have to give them a tracking number in order to get a refund.  That was not a part of the return policy.  At that point I couldn't find my tracking number so I had to beg my post office for copy.  Another waste of 2 hours.The worst part is that this phone isn't even a great deal.  I got a new brand model from Boost mobile for the same price.  If you want one on the Verizon network, then go with a Groupon deal - again, for the same price.  Don't risk a refurbished unless there is a steep discount.Lastly, if you want a free phone, just buy one from these guys and return an empty box.  Yes, they are so disorganized that they will give you a refund.  I didn't do this, but you certainly can.
            "
"2695","After using 2 new SIM cards it still does not stay connected to the AT&T network. And this was certified refurbished? Are you kidding me! Here comes your ZERO star review!
