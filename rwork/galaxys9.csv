"1","I will be utmost honest here. This is my first device review. I was hesitant to order a Certified Refurbished phone. Especially since it is...a phone. The meat and bone of daily life and communication. However, upon receiving the phone, everything was inside a white uniform box. Nothing special and nothing damaged at all. Simplistic and efficient packaging. The phone works great and no one can tell it isn't ""Brand new"". Absolutely no scratches or signs it has been touched by another human. 10/10 item and you save 100$ in the process by getting refurbished! I am switching from an iPhone 6 to this S9 on ATnT. Simply pull the SIM out and insert into s9 and you are ready to go.
            "
"2","The phone itself worked really well and was brand new and has no scratches. Unfortunately it was not truly unlocked and connected to the sprinit network and was not able to change over to verizon. I had to send back but again only because it was not unlocked.  The phone itself was good.

"3","<U+0001F52B>Note: This review will be updated numerous times as the phone ages. And be jealous of my green laser gun.Service Provider: STRAIGHT TALKApple only user (7 years)BACKGROUND: My iPhone 5s went to poo <U+0001F4A9>(For the second time in 7 years I lost an iPhone). Each time the ""geniuses"" told me my phone was not repairable and I had to buy a new phone.  AND both times it was the charge connector that just went completely crap one day.  Great.  Looking back I guess I was part of the many brainwashed sheep with the one track mind thinking Apple leads all.  But in reality, they are stuck in neutral.  Since they lost Steve Jobs, no one has stepped up to be that Willy Wonka of cutting edge ideas and showmanship.  And its blatantly obvious to me now.  Oh and guess what?  They now make the headphones use the same failure prone adapter on all new iPhones (meaning you cannot wire charge and listen to headphones), so I finally decided to stop eating rotten Apples.  And I decided to Hitchhike a Ride on a Galaxy S9.  Now I know you'll say a 5s is older and its comparing apples and oranges (that pun was unintentional<U+0001F92E>...my apoligies), but my friend has an iPhone X and let me try it.  It wasn't that much different of an Apple experience.  And it was 400 more than this phone. (I apologize for my overt digressions, but phones are a huge investment and I try to make my reviews thorough and whatever the perfect opposite of boring is...I hope.)Day 1:  I'm really $%@!$& nervous.  Did I make the right decision?  I'm a textbook overthinker.  I went without a phone for 9 days trying to decide.  And here I am.  Waiting on a refurbished Galaxy S9.  Finally Delivered.  First box is the typical smaller Amazon box.  Second inside is a small white box. Very simple worry-free packaging.  Inside that box was the phone, A/C adaptor, charge cord, and a paper with quickstart and APN help.  Also a card from Amazon saying contact the seller first with a problem blah blah Charlie Brown teacher voice blah blah blah.  So I have made a few certified refurbished electronic purchases in the past and they worked out great, so I was not as apprehensive as maybe a refurb greenhorn might be.  But listen.  Phone is in hand now.  And this phone is stunning.  Immaculate.  I went over it and it looks COMPLETELY brand new.  The screen is perfect.  Don't be afraid.  Jump in the water.  Buy refurbished.  Ok...so here is my first negative, but its petty really.  I bought the ""lilac"" colored phone because I love light colored purples like lilac and lavender.  Only this isn't really either.  I'd call this more of a pinker color with a hint of purple, but its still sleek and nice and can be covered up with a case if needed. Ok so physical condition out of the box I'd give a solid grade A+  Now for the SIM card.  Again I am a Straight Talk user (looooove them...4 years strong now).  My iPhone has been tanked and off for about 9 days.  I popped out the SIM card from the rotten phone, popped out the Samsung SIM tray and dropped in the SIM, pushing the tray back flush.  Powered the phone on.  Without going through every single step, the setup was so easy and seamless.  It automatically found my service provider, so I would say this is pretty much as close to plug and play as you can get.  So awesome.  I am falling hard like Pete for Ariana for this phone...Well...I've been playing with the phone for a few hours now.  I cannot put it down.  So many things are infinitely better than Apple.  I'm going to list a few and stop the review for Day 1.  And if you made it this far, peace and love neighbor.  Happy phone hunting.  You're beautiful<U+0001F31E><U+0001F31C><U+26F1><U+0001F31A><U+0001F31F>1. Customization:  THEMES! I can't stop trying these out. They change the sounds and wallpapers and App icons and probably other cool stuff I don't realize all at once.  They are so cool.  Text messages look different.  And the wallpapers can be animated.  Lock screens can be videos.  I am admittedly geeking a little. Android systems let you change soooooooo much.  And I am a customization freak.  Not only can you choose from hundreds of free and paid themes on the Google Play store, but you can choose from so many different fonts as well (and you can choose from tons for free and money the same way).  You can set the order of so many things, it's just the coolest.  Oh and here is a great one.  For the OCD users like me, who hated when you couldn't delete an apple app, you still have those on Android you cannot delete as well.  BUT YOU CAN HIDE THEM!2. The button clicks are addictive.  It feels like you are pushing a button when its the bare screen.  I have a screen protector on AND and phone case and it's still extremely responsive.3. The swiping motions aren't that different from Apple.  I'm navigating like a pro.  I'm sure there are how-to videos I need to watch to learn all of the shortcuts, but I'm doing just fine.Ok.  Enough for now.  I'm jonesing to play with the phone waaaaaay more.  Ask any questions you want.  I will answer all I can. I will update this review as I see the need.Peace and Love,The Muffin Man

"4","Phone was NOT unlocked and had a defective screen, which kept changing colors (as if the blue light filter was on).
            "
"5","I have not ever written a review but thought this would be helpful after I read the reviews and was a little wary of the unlocked feature.  Some have had problems when putting the SIM card in from a different carrier.  I had the same problem and felt helpless when the Sprint logo launched on my phone when I turned it on.  So after much searching I found sites to send me unlocked codes for a fee of about $50 and thought about it.  (The ""unlock"" feature can apply to international carriers but may still be ""locked"" to a certain carrier).  Sprint will unlock the phone for free if the prior bill and the phone have been paid as well as the phone being used for at least 50 days.  So I called Sprint to get the code and found out that the phone was unlocked on their system.  I didn't need to put in a new code.  I then called ATT and after setting up some menus, I was good to go.  The only hassle I have now is a notification that the phone cannot connect to the Sprint network.  It sits it the top bar when I scroll through the other notifications but is not intrusive.  So outside of doing the above legwork, I'm happy with the phone (4 days in).  It just should be made more clear about the phone truly being unlocked from the carrier and what needs to be done to get on to another network.  It makes it feel a little deceptive in the advertising without this information
            "
"6","About a month after the return window closed, the phone started to randomly shut down and restart.  I did a factory reset hoping that would fix it, but unfortunately, it did not.  There has been a slight improvement (i.e., less restarts), but I'm still having problems.  I'll be taking it into the Sprint store to see if there is anything they can do, but my advice right now would be to pay the extra money for a non-refurbished phone.Very disappointed.
            "
"7","I was kind of nervous buying a refurbish device. After taking a chance and receiving the device, I am grateful I took that chance. So I am posting this review to ease anyone's reservation you may have. My fiance love it!
            "
"8","I should have read the other reviews.  This is not a truly unlocked phone.  It works with my ATT simcard but I get an annoying notification that it can't connect to Sprint and I cannot access visual voicemail.  The charging cable provided looks like it came from a gas station and that it would probably harm the phone.  Although they said it may be a generic charger, i did expect one somewhat in the same neighborhood of quality as the factory charger.
            "
"9","Coming from the S8, it is very pleasing to hold!  It is thicker, so it doesn't seem to be slippery as much.  Truthfully, I bought it for the stereo speakers, but the Dolby Atmos just enhannces the overall sound experience
            "
"10","So I was under the impression I was ordering a completely unlocked phone...instead I received an unlocked Verizon phone with instructions on how to use it for ATT...however the instructions being quite self explanatory DO NOT WORK! I have repeated them to the best of my ability, the only inconsistency I see in the paper and the phone option is for the ATT ""mode"" there is one missing on the phone that is listed on the paper instructions sent with my phone...regardless I feel this is bad advertising...this is not a completely unlocked phone.
            "
"11","Phone came with a cracked screen. Otherwise works ok. About to contact them about it. Will update with the customer serviceCustomer service was good I got my money back for the phone.
            "
"12","Arrived super early, before tracking could even report it's movementsAppears to be perfect; minor hair scratches on the screen, seems to have a screen cover on it already, minor charging port scratches, crystal back, truly a gorgeous color even if I'm just going to put a cover on itNot sure if this is an s9 thing or not, relatively heavy pressure needed to engage the touch screen (like typing or moving tiles). Changed the sensitivity to ""screen protector"" setting, MUCH better.Came in a plain white plastic envelope with a bubble-pack USPS flat-rate envelope inside that with a plain white box inside that. Wrapped in a bubble sheet inside the box. Very protected!Not the original charger. EDIT: Makes an alarming sound, will be purchasing a safe charger.Will be trying the new sim in it later (AT&T). EDIT: Woohoo! It works with AT&T, unlocked.
            "
"13","I was hesitant before buying a refurbished version based on some of the reviews. However, the price was a huge deal and I decided to give it a try. I chose purple version as it was a cheapest one. The device came in fantastic condition! Looked like new! I use US T-Mobile and it works smoothly. The only thing I did was to switch the SIM card from my old device. No need to call anybody, configurate anything, etc. There was also a manual attached with info on what to do if you have a problem with connection to your provider. The cable and charger included weren't the best, so I would advise to get a new one. It's still worth it anyway as the price is much more affordable than what is offered in stores!
            "
"14","The S9 I purchased specifically for AT&T support was not cleared of the Sprint network the previous owner had subscribed to. AT&T set their service up to the phone, but could not clear the prior Sprint network, creating issues such as calls from my saved contacts showing the number only, international call errors for inbound and outbound domestic calls, not receiving texts, location identified to be in Chico, CA (not Dallas Ft Worth, no voicemail accessand apps not opening or available for install/refresh. The only way to clear the Sprint Network is to obtain the prior owners social security, passcode, and other personal info, which I or Electronic Deals has or can obtain. The phone is being sent back today, and Electronic Deals has been great in allowing for the return. Hopefully the replacement phone is actually cleared and supports only AT&T. 3 generous stars for hoping Electronic Deals replaces the phone with an S9 that is ACTUALLY UNLOCKED, for an overall frustrating and time consuming purchase because of a lack of diligence in advertising a phone as unlocked and compatible with AT&T when that simply isnt the case. Hoping to have positive feedback for Electronic Deals on the replacement phone.
            "
"15","The phone is in good condition, works well, works with GSM Simple Mobile (TMobile towers) but there's all kinds of settings and things running in the background that show it was associated with Spring, annoying stuff. PLUS the biggest issue is that we took the phone to Mexico and Data Roaming (Under Mobile Networks) is not available which is crazy as we had that feature in our previous Galaxy A5. That is a deal breaker as we have prepaid plans and with Simple Mobile plans Mexico is covered, but not being able to turn Data Roaming is not acceptable. I believe the issue is associated with the fact that these certified refurbished devices are truly NOT UNLOCKED, they must come from different carriers and in this case is Sprint. Fix the problem, replace my device, and I will change the rating to 5. Otherwise, DO NOT BUY.
            "
"16","I was worried after I ordered and the item shipped. Because I saw after that it would not work on metropcs however I checked the IMEI on metropcs website and it said it would work. I placed my chip from the old phone in but it said no network so I could not make calls. But I remembered that the last time I used an unlock phone on Metropcs I had to call them so they could switch over the network so I called and they said just inserting the chip doesn't register the device with them you have TO CALL from another phone and give them the IMEI number so they can hook it up.The phone looks great came a day early and I love it. No scratches looks brand new only the charger is slow charging so I want to get an OEM from samsung as I fear the generic charger may cause damage to the phone if used to long.
            "
"17","Phone has a minor but very annoying glitch.  When I open my email, it closes the app and goes back to home screen so I cant even reply to emails sometimes. Same thing with spotify, it shuts it down whenever it feels like?
            "
"18","The phone wasn't unlocked, save yourself the trouble and buy from somewhere not scamming you.
            "
"19","The phone was not like the picture
            "
"20","Overall I am very satisfied with this phone.Visually, the phone looks great and is in amazing condition. There are miniscule scratches in two of the corners, but it cannot be seen unless you are intently looking for a flaw. Either way, a case will cover the already unapparent blemishes. The rest fo the body of the phone looks like new, and it came with a thin protective film over the screen for temporary protection.In regards to software, it runs smoothly and is easily updated to the latest software available for the S9. I appreciated that there are no carrier-related bloat apps. I had to manually download MyMetro because I use it to pay my montly bill, but that's the only carrier-related app it came with. It also allows me to uninstall many of Google's bloat apps, so more internal storage for me.The phone arrived snuggly in a box along with a generic 3ft charger. This phone uses an USB-C type charger, so micro-USB cables won't fit.This phone came fully unlocked and I was easily able to get it activated through MetroPCS.
            "
"21","My phone arrived packaged well and on time. Unlike some other reviewers, my unit was truly unlocked and activated smoothly with Sprint. Everything on the phone is in good working condition, with no functional issues with the camera, ports, sensors, or screen. The reason I'm giving it only three stars is because the phone shows some minor flaws due to being used. The screen and back have multiple small scratches, and the speaker grill was very dirty. The battery life is good, but definitely below that of a brand new unit.  The phone is listed as refurbished, and priced accordingly, but it comes off as more of a ""used in good condition"" product than a ""factory refurbished"" one.
            "
"22","Nothing to worry about. Seems like a trusted seller. Has 90day warranty and phone came in Amazom rewards box with charging assecories. I try avoiding contracts and paying double the phones value and just purchase it cheap, slap my sim into the phone, adjust apn settings and keep rolling. If you have straight talk look up Gs9 apn settings to activate data. And goto apps manager in settings, click 3 dots goto system apps and force stop ""sprint omadm"" to get rid of pesky alert.
            "
"23","The phone came in perfect condition. It came with a Samsung charger, but not the right one for this phone model, haha (the charger is for old Android devices). It also came with a SIM card remover, a supposed 90-day warranty with the seller¡¯s contact info, and a Mint mobile 7 day free trial. I¡¯ve used it for a few days so far and there are no issues with battery life, screen, nor sound. If I ever encounter any problems, I may update this review. I love it so far!
            "
"24","As others have said this is a really nice phone. However it does not come ready to just put in your sim card and use. I have T-Mobile and this phone came programmed to us cellular. I tried all of the quick fixes to no avail, the seller sent me some instructions that were very difficult to follow and this didn't change the network. I was about to return it and then ended up trouble shooting it online and about 3 hrs later I got it to work. This really isn't what you expect when buying an ""unlocked"" phone.
            "
"25","Just as advertised. Feels like brand new; you can't even tell it's refurbished. It's unlocked and mine is working with Metro PCS.
            "
"26","Beautiful and in perfect condition.
            "
"27","Bought this phone for my wife upgrading from the S6. The 3 generation difference is huge as the screen resolution, battery life, and camera functions have all been upgraded to the top of its class. Just keep in mind that the USB charging wires have been upgraded to the 3.0 series so the old charging cords will not be compatible with this phone. Having had the phone for nearly 6 months, I can say with conviction that I would purchase this phone again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a top notch phone.
            "
"28","1/1/19, just set the phone up today. The phone was previously a T-Mobile phone. I cannot speak to whether it is truly unlocked, but I can say that it works perfectly with Straight Talk service. I purchased the refurbished S9 in Coral Blue to replace an S6 that was also on Straight Talk. The phone required a new SIM card, which I purchased through Straight Talk. I did use the T-Mobile compatible SIM that was in the activation kit. The Straight Talk website did not successfully complete the port of the phone number from the S6 to this S9, but a phone call to their customer service was successful. No additional settings had to be changed in order to use mobile data or send/receive MMS.Accessories: The screen cover that came on the phone kept falling off, so I simply removed it. I wasn't expecting one to come with the phone anyway, so no harm no foul. I'll buy another to replace it. The charger was, in fact, a Samsung brand charger. The cord was wrapped in plastic as if completely new, and the brick was still sealed in its original bag. The phone did not come with any audio devices (e.g., earbuds/headphones), which is par for the course with refurbished phones.Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase.
            "
"29","the phone arrived in a timely manner and was properly packaged but didn't function properly. the screen did not allow me to press certain  buttons in the center bottom part and it kept glitching with certain apps. All of this was discovered the day it arrived so safe to say it did not perform. The most annoying part is that when I returned I had to pay to send it back. the phone did work with my cell phone network which is T-mobile in case you value that info.
            "
"30","The phone is in perfect condition.  I gave it 5 stars because for what I was buying it was perfect.  BUT what I failed to read was the product description in which it says ""It will NOT work on Verizon, Boost, Virgin Mobile or any other CDMA network besides Sprint.""  Bummer.  I returned because I am on the Verizon network and the phone will not work for me.  =(
            "
"31","My phone arrived and I am pleased with the added security features and how the phone is performing. It is taking a bit of a learning curve to learn the features as I switched from a Galaxy S6 to this Galaxy S9.  But so far, so good!  I am happy with this purchase.
            "
"32","The phone had sprint apps and had a defect in the camera.
            "
"33","The phone came in an original Samsung S9 box.  If I didn't know it was refurbished I would have thought it was brand spanking new.  Not a scratch, mark or smudge on it.  Its unlocked as advertised. I don't live in the US and wouldn't be able to use it if it wasn't unlocked. It was easy to set up my mobile network. The features on the S9 are awesome. Camera's are crystal clear.  The speaker is a good volume as well.  I have only had the phone for about a week but so far so good.  It charges super fast and the battery last for hours, practically all day.. It came with the Samsung charger and some headphones that were not Samsung. The left speaker on the headphones doesn't work.  But that's not a big deal for me.  I am just glad the phone is in perfect working condition.. hopefully it stays that way.  If anything changes I will provide an update.
            "
"34","This is, quite simply, the best smartphone currently on the market. It fits in the hand much better than I expected, is blindingly fast and its svelte form is very attractive. Though it is ""Certified Refurbished"", it is virtually new. There is no difference.
            "
"35","I was wanted a new galaxy s9, after shopping around I realized fresh out of the box brand new was too pricey for me. So I decided to look on amazon for refurbished.This is my first time buying any refurbished product and I have to say I'm amazed! It looks, sounds, and operates like brand new! There were no scratches or issues.It was an easy 1,2,3 to activate this phone. I have metro PCS.I would also like to add I was a previous iPhone user. It takes some getting used to initially and you need to set your preferences. In the end it works amazing! I will buy my next phone from this seller!
            "
"36","Loved the phone as soon as I received it. But that didn't last long. I was able to start logging in my information. But when I went to log in I was unable to. Because I'm now Locked Out!!! I didn't know what to do! Trying to find out where & what I can get it fixed so I can use it.
            "
"37","The phone I got was supposed to be compatible with ""METRO"" but wasn't.  After some investigation, it turns out this phone was formerly ""Sprint"" and won't work properly on Metro.  After contacting the vendor there was no hesitation, and they sent me a fully compatible ""METRO"" phone which works perfectly.  I have no complaint, though it would have been great to have gotten it right the first time.......  Vendor Support Very Good.
            "
"38","Truth is your chances of landing a good phone are 50/50. Lots of bad reviews doesn't mean you'll strike out. I spent $400 on this phone from a place called D'Tech Mobile out of Florida, and I'm on cloud 9 right now. Perfect condition and unlocked. The battery life is noticeably lower but that's expected. A+++ JOB!
            "
"39","Unfortunately the phone received was not compatible with the Verizon network. Be careful.  Call the seller to confirm. Too bad none of the sellers make this clear. Other than that, the phone looked new, turned on etc.

"40","This phone is not only not unlocked, it is also a branded att phone with crap applications you cannot uninstall.Turns out that it will take a week to get an unlock code, the phone is going back...

"41","Outstanding phone. Transfer from old to new was a snap. Bought to replace older phone
            "
"42","Great phone, but it didn¡¯t work with straight talk. Luckily I had Tmobile, so I just added my boyfriend to my plan.
            "
"43","I've had this phone for about a week now and coming from a 3 year old Galaxy S6 Edge it feels great. Just took my AT&T SIM card out of my old phone and into this one and it worked flawlessly. Apart from the packaging you could swear this was a brand new phone. Really quick and snappy, I haven't had any lag on this phone yet.Only nitpick is that it doesn't come with the latest Android firmware. I had to do a 500 MB update to Android Oreo followed by a 1700 MB update to upgrade to Android Pie. It was time consuming but very worth it as Android Pie makes this phone a lot better.
            "
"44","The information on the page reads, ""The products will have minimal to no signs of wear, no visible cosmetic imperfections when held 12 inches away""  I think we can all agree that this phone does not meet that requirement.

"45","Phone arrived, could not be used. Water damaged and never should have been sold.
            "
"46","This was a Amazon refurbished phone(can't remember the technical name of the program)  Works like new, no issues with it so far. Battery will make it about 2days before recharging. I don't use it for very many videos/games. Mainly work, texts, emails, banking, etc.
            "
"47","Everything went good switching over to this phone was no problem. All features worked great. The phone looks brand new.  I can't tell it's a used phone. Its fast, screen was perfect. Camera works like new. Great picture,and lots of options. Battery seems kinda worn a little. Goes low a little sooner than I thought it would. Takes about 2 weeks to get everything going good. This was my first smartphone, and easy to get use to.
            "
"48","This phone was not truly unlocked, and customer service was very poor. They really should advertise it differently. The phone itself was fine.
            "
"49","Its been 4 days since the phone arrived and it just brought me headache. I put my Straight Talk chip and didn¡¯t work. So I bought a new chip bc I had an intention to change my number, tried the AT&T chip and again didn¡¯t work. I spent more then 5 hours on the phone with the costumer support and nothing.On the next morning went to T-Mobile, it does work, when I¡¯m at the store! As soon as a leave the store stop working, get the signal and loses all the time.It¡¯s just frustrating. Returning it.

"50","I was worried about buying a refurbished phone but this phone has been wonderful and everything I hoped for! It works perfectly, pictures are amazingly clear, the battery life lasts the entire day (my old phone I had to charge throughout the day). This was a great purchase.
            "
"51","The best feature about this phone is how fast it responds. No delay when you make a selection. The photos it takes are very sharp allowing extreme cropping. It was easy transferring data from my old phone to this one. I find myself using the phone more and my computer less because of the phone's speed.
            "
"52","Recieved this phone yesterday and I'm loving it! A couple small cosmetic scratches but nothing that noticable.  Phone was unlocked and easily switched my Straight Talk SIM from old phone to this one. Smart switch transferred all of my info from one phone to the next quickly. Battery life is good. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase!
            "
"53","The phone I received still had the previous owner's Google Account synced to it. I couldn't do ANYTHING with the phone that I was so excited to have because of this. I looked up many ways to try to bypass the sign in and also messaged Breed (the company that sent me the phone) but their customer service told me they ""don't offer technical support."" After contacting Samsung their CS told me the only thing I could do was send back the phone. Such a waste of my time and money.
            "
"54","Last S9 I bought was still locked and had to be returned. This one, didn't even come with the correct plug. Now I have a dead phone with no means of charging it, so now I need to go out and buy a new plug for the S9, charge it, and hope it is not still locked. The one positive is that I have one more plug for my broken phone.Do I have bad luck or are they playing games?
            "
"55","It had scratches on  It  and the batteries not that good and it didn't come with any instructions.  The phone gets real hot when it's charging the cable charger is generic.. When listening to music to phone gets me your hot. I think I'm going to returning it back
            "
"56","I was super nervous ordering this phone after reading several reviews stating the phove was not unlocked.  I did however notice those who noted that did not have AT&T.  I had contacted the company and while it took a few days to respond, they did and were able to easy my concerns.  I will buy from this company again if needed.
            "
"57","Honestly this was a great phone and it looked brant new. The only issue is original phone started working perfectly fine hence we didn¡¯t need this one anymore. I was very impressed with the product and the price tho. I would totally recommend it. Not a scratch or dent anywhere.
            "
"58","I haven't had a chance to turn it on yet or play with it, (I'll edit my review after, if there are any changes...) but I'm EXTREMELY impressed at how fast it shipped to me! And the appearance is Fantastic. Looks completely Brand new! (I am waiting for my protection package for my phone before transferring my sim card and using my phone... Otherwise it might look like my current shattered faceplate phone I'm using!.... Butterfingers I am!)

"59","The phone came in perfect condition however after using it for about a month out of nowhere is stopped working with my cell phone provider when I went to Metro PC to see as to why they advised me that the phone has either been blacklisted by carrier or the previous may have reported it lost or stolen
            "
"60","The phone came looking good, no scratches, clean, and no fingerprints. But when I started using it for typing I began to realize the screen is faulty. On the edge parts the phone cannot register touch correctly. Don't buy this phone unless you want a pretty paperweight.
            "
"61","I got this product on time and in good looking condition however the first night I had to fiddle with the charger to get it to work and it only got worse from there over the past month and 20 or so days of having this phone the charging port has work randomly and at this point it won't work at all, I'm sure in the morning that it will work again with enough fiddling but I am going to try and get another phone through amazons 90 day policy
            "
"62","The phone worked well, no scratches fairly fast. Only problem was the phone was locked to T-mobile and the seller put me off with his ways of resolving involving 3rd party shipping through fedex
            "
"63","The phone itself is great. Came with one minor scratch on the screen that is so small it's virtually unnoticeable. No software issues or anything. It is however a sprint unlocked phone. I have metro and managed to get my carrier operating on the phone just fine with no issues however. Simply put in the sim card, called metro customer support, and they switched the phones for me with no issues. Extremely satisfied and glad I saved all that money.
            "
"64","PHONE IS UNLOCKED BUT NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MOST CARRIERS.
            "
"65","I just got my package today and I'm in love! It arrived 4 days before the planned delivery (How awesome is that??). The phone looks like it's brand new (even though it's refurbished) with not a scratch in the sight. I've checked everything, from camera to speakers and it seems to be in a perfect condition! I will be back after a couple of weeks to update the review. As for now, 5 stars!
            "
"66","I received my phone unlocked and it switched to my carrier with no issue.  The phone arrived in a generic box, but it came with no damage and in perfect working order.  The phone doesn't come with headphones, and it is a standard charger, but that is to be expected with a refurbished phone.  If I somehow break my phone and need a replacement, I would definitely reorder this.
            "
"67","My 'refreshed' Galaxy S9 arrived quickly and professionally packaged. Works great, no problems.
            "
"68","THIS PHONE WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK ON VERIZON AND IT DID NOT. This was a Sprint phone and would Not work on a CDMA network. I had to return it.
            "
"69","I love Amazon refurbished electronics!! A good deal gets even better!  I'd give this 5 stars except for Bixby button and the fact that it's so slick, I'm afraid I'm going to drop it (no case yet).  Samsung S9 is a really nice phone and for this price, huge value for money!
            "
"70","Not really unlocked for tmobile.  Video call and opting to turn wifi call on at will missing. Icons are odd and kid like design.
            "
"71","This phone works great for Sprint service, I bought a 3 dollar chip and it activated right away. Updated fine and Sprint allowed the device to be covered by the 15$ month warranty. Just as good as a new phone.
            "
"72","Would never know it was refurbished. Just slid my sim card(Straight Talk) in and powered it up. No issues in the 3 months I've had it.
            "
"73","I have been searching for a new phone and wad stick between iPhone and Galaxy.  I am so glad I chose the Galaxy.  Great quality,  fast,  and exactly what I expected and more from Samsung.
            "
"74","The phone itself is great.  After I inserted my Straight Talk sim card, the phone asked for a network code.  The phone wasn't unlocked so had to return it.
            "
"75","bought the phone everything seems to work fine, besides sd card tried multiple sd cards, even an sd card that works on my other phone doesn't work on this, prior to all this bought a 2nd phone for my mother in law, not sure if that one works, however seller wants me to send back the phone before they send a replacement, which means I would have to be without a phone till they send the new phone, spent all this money and the phone doesn't even work perfectly......disappointed
            "
"76","This phone is not unlocked. I should have trusted the other reviews, but was hopefully my T-mobile SIM would work. It did not and I am upset the seller is lying to their customers.
            "
"77","It came in a good condition. Started using  it last night.it also has a 90 days warranty. Will  make an update  after 90days. Came with a charger. Pretty much looks new to me. Hope I do not find any faults.
            "
"78","This phone showed up with cracks all over the front and the back of the phone.  I had to order another one before I could return the defective one.
            "
"79","Phone had slight damage on corner and delivered package was missing accessories such as the USB connector, micro USB connector, AKG earphones, and additional earphone gel tips.
            "
"80","Awesome refurbished phone! The only slught scratch I found was on the front which I couldn't even tell until a few days later. The phone works as brand new. Happy with the purchase and worth the price.
            "
"81","Great phone, perfect condition, but it did come tied to AT&T rather than unlocked as advertised. I thought it would be more of a hassle to get it unlocked, but all I had to do was send an unlock request to A&TT and they had it done in a day.
            "
"82","So far so good. Phone was just like new, had Samsung accessories, and no bloatware from a specific carrier. Setup was easy at my tmobile store, and the guy who helped me said this was a great price for an S9.
            "
"83","no me llego ningun accesorio, aunque generico, ni cargador,ni audifonos ni la caja siquiera clml indica la descripcion en la pagina
            "
"84","The phone was not truly unlocked. It had a bunch of built in Sprint apps that could not be uninstalled, the phone kept trying and failing to connect to the Sprint network despite being connected to a different carrier. It would restart at random.
            "
"85","It arrived on time I only received the phone charger and charger cube I have been testing the phone for a couple weeks now there  was no scratches cracks  or scrapes the battery life didn't last as long as it should but still a decent 7 hours for a 100% Great Picture Quality super clear and High Resolution Over all For the price its a Incredible deal
            "
"86","Haven't had an issues as of yet. Works great.
            "
"87","I was a bit apprehensive about ordering this galaxy s9 after reading some of the reviews. However, the phone was better than expected and even though it isn't completely unlocked through Sprint, I was still able to activate it and use it through Metro PCS which is my carrier. I couldn't be happier.
            "
"88","It is not fully unlocked from Sprint.But it is fully functioning well with all other mobile carriers.  I was a little bit upset because a page of Sprint keeps pumping up. But later I found out you can block that page most of the time.  Thus, I think with this price, it is an OKAY deal. I would say, Thank you for your business, but be faithful with your goods title.
            "
"89","This is a great phone for a great price. I had this phone for 1 month, no issues. I would definitely recommend the product to my friends.
            "
"90","This phone was not satisfactory. The screen was buggy from the start, and it came with a deep crack on the left side, large enough to become a much larger crack later very easily. The battery also drained super quickly. I sent it back and did not have my return processed until over a week later. I bought the same phone, brand-new, from Best Buy for $100 more. The best I can say is that the company took accepted my return..?
            "
"91","I was a little hesitant because of some reviews saying their phone was not unlocked, but mine was delivered in perfect condition and I was able to add my old SIM card and transfer service to my new phone easily.
            "
"92","The phone came without a sim card slot opening pin. It also did not come with earphones. The charger was not original either. I called them thinking they just forgot to pack them. I was told the phone does not come with those items. How am I expected to open the sim card slot? oh well
            "
"93","The phone worked as expected seemingly new with no issues until a few weeks in when it started shutting off every few minutes by itself. This was frustrating because it would turn off in the night and the alarm I'd set wouldn't sound. The only fix for this I've found is keeping the phone charging and on the home screen or in an app while enabling the developer setting that prevents auto-sleep.
            "
"94","There was a question about can you get updates the answer is yes I went to updates and downloaded it.
            "
"95","I was sent a Verizon locked phone. More scratches on phone than anticipated and finger print scraner is cracked. I would still keep it if it was unlocked, but I will have to return. Sad face!!!
            "
"96","Thought it was Verizon compatible. Unfortunately it will be returned.  I have reordered the same phone.
            "
"97","I could not be more satisfied. I found no blemishes and it worked with my service right out of the box.
            "
"98","No hiccups at all with this refurbished phone! I've had it for months and it's working great!
            "
"99","Overall - this phone is good and consumer reports rate it near the top for value.  One caveat though, I foolishly reclined horizontally on a park bench and it fell from my pocket about 2 feet & the screen cracked immediately - despite having  the worthless protector.  For $500-$700 smartphones, you'd think they'd have figured out how to perfect shatter proof screens by now!
            "
"100","The price was good, quality was very good, like new... the only thing was that there were no instructions on the functions of the buttons or the icons to navigate the system... so I had to 'play' with them... still ""playing""... would rather know what they all do... right? before all the 'trial and errors'... but, in general, a very good, value for the money and quality... I am not yet disappointed in the Samsung Galaxy S9...
            "
"101","Got the phone two days early, it was fully unlocked, got started immediately. Came with original charger, minus the two USB adapters. Screen has one tiny but deep scratch at the top
            "
"102","Was a blacklist phone. Couldn¡¯t activate
            "
"103","The phone came on time and it works fine. Almost brand new. Unfortunately, its still locked to At&T. Hopefully, AT&T will be able to unlock the phone. If not, then I'll need my money back. That's how it is.
            "
"104","Phone did not come unlocked, spent money unlocking it, phone is also turning on and off by itself.
            "
"105","Phone looks as it should. It doesn't obtain signal like my other att phone. I have to have it hooked to wifi to work.
            "
"106","I absolutely love the phone. It looks like a brand new phone with no visible flaws. The only downside is the battery life.  The battery percentage drops very quickly even when it hasn't been used. Not sure if I can purchase a new battery or not but I will be looking into it.  Other than that I would definitely buy again from this seller.
            "
"107","The problem with phone is camera, when I tried to take pics the phone shuts down
            "
"108","I opened the box to discover the screen had a huge crack that went all the way down the screen. Very disappointed.
            "
"109","Trying to update the software I got the phone locked for unauthorized software. Now I'm concerned about returning it as all my data are uploaded and I can't reset or delete it!
            "
"110","Excelente producto, llego el dia indicado hasta el momento todo va bien
            "
"111","I wasn't expecting a top notch phone for the discounted price I paid, but this phone exceeded my expectations. Very minimal wear, and battery life is higher than expected.
            "
"112","I love the phone! Haven't used all the features yet. Only 1 issue, certain pictures in the gallery Become corrupted. Thats extremely frustrating. Maybe its the SD card
            "
"113","Only giving 4 stars because my phone charging cord did not work. The wall adapter was the fast charging one but apparently the cord did not work. Everything else was great. It arrived on time but I had to sign for it which I did not know and the mail carrier did not ring the door bell. Phone has no marks, charges just fine n easy to use.
            "
"114","The phone kept shutting itself off and on by itself.
            "
"115","But it a month agoNo problem as of nowCome as a newWith chargerNo ear plugs
            "
"116","Me ha fallado el cargador o el puerto USB de carga y mande mi mensaje de texto para garantia y Un estoy esperando respuesta llevo tres diasEl telefono muy. Bueno pero eso paso
            "
"117","Got it at a good price. $439. Current price is now showing $455. So what if it doesnt come in a Samsung box. Showed no wear and works great so far.  Only draw back. No headphones.
            "
"118","Thought the facial & iris scanning take a little while it is still super nice and it still works with my glasses. It is much faster when I am not wearing glasses. The fingerprint scanner is super fast screen is great quality and the battery life lasts a full day and a half with my usage.
            "
"119","Very locked to Verizon.
            "
"120","Es un celular usado que cuesta igual que un nuevo y viene sin cargador original ni audifonos ni llave

            "
"122","I had a galaxy s7 and it needed a new phone. So i decided to buy a refurb one to save money. The phone came with third party charger and cable. Which worked fine. I have verizon, dropped the sim and used samsung smart switch and everything went well. Will update if anything changes.
            "
"123","This phone takes great pictures, love Bixby feature, charges really fast. Good sized screen. Extremely pleased so far.
            "
"124","Phone is definitely not unlocked, spent 3 hours in Sprint yesterday for them to tell me this phone is stuck on AT&T network.

"135","Amazing quality
            "
"136","This phone works pretty well, but it didnt have a sd/sim card remover. I would have to gain one from the store. Was kinda a bad side to it.
            "
"137","So far I absolutely love the Samsung Galaxy s9. I can't tell it's refurbished at all.

            "
"142","It worked great for the first 2 weeks I had it then the fingerprint scanner stopped working. Everything else still worked fine but that was a dealbreaker for me. Everything else was fantastic though
            "
"143","The phone seems to be working just like new so far. It came with everything necessary in basic packaging, minus a phone guide. Other than the phone not being in original packaging, I could not tell that this phone has been used before.

            "

            "
"146","I'm overall impressed with this phone. Looks as good as a new phone, no scratches or dents. Set up was a breeze, and had no problems with metro adding this phone. All it took was a phone call and the phone was up and running.
            "
"147","I was a lil skeptical at first buying a certified refurbished UNLOCKED phone BUT....i have to say im shocked!

If your thinking of buying this amazing phone buy this and save yourself some extra money since it's cheaper than buying it at the store. Also the camera quality is amazing and I love it.

            "
"254","I should have read reviews before buying. It seems the sim card key isn't included, as stated by other reviews. How am I supposed to use the phone if I can't open the tray. Ended up having to buy a pack of safety pins. Also, doesn't come with headphones.
            "
"255","UNLOCKED YES, BUT... SELLER FAILED TO STATE THAT IT CANNOT BE ROOTED. THIS IS THE ONLY VERSION OF THE SAMSUNG S9 THAT'S SO CLOSELY CONTROLLED THAT IT CANNOT BE ROOTED, JAIL-BROKEN, ROOTED OR OTHERWISE CLEARED OF THE USELESS SAMSUNG BLOAT-WARE (LIKE BIXBY) THAT I CANNOT DELETE OR UNINSTALL. THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THIS PHONE IS BECAUSE IT WAS IMPLIED THAT I COULD ROOT IT... MY BAD> IT WAS SIMPLY UNLOCKED... DO NOT BE FOOLED. THIS PHONE IS NOT WORTH AS MUCH AS OTHER SAMSUNG S-9 PHONES THAT ARE UNLOCKED AND CAN BE ROOTED...
            "
"256","Well, I've been considering an S9 for about six months and am on Verizon. Our S5's were starting to suck for air. I leased an S7 about six months ago and it is pretty much an S5 on steroids. But finally, my wife's S5 has pretty much given up the ghost so I was forced, yes forced to get something. Every time I look at the lease price or unlocked prices for the S9's, 9pluses, I just gag however...until a week ago and Amazon put a 20% off open box/used ones. I got an unlocked S9 (purple one) for 352 bucks. I was very nervous about buying a ""used"" one and read the horror stories from others on this type of purchase but decided since it was Amazon and not one of the other purchasers that I could return relatively easy if it was a pile o pooh. Well, surprise surprise, it came and looked new. No cosmetic dings and maybe one or two smudges on the phone but it had been put back in the box so you could hardly tell from new including the accessories that had NEVER been touched obviously.  I did most of the work online with an excellent Verizon rep on chat but ended up going to my store. The guy there activated without the activation charge and asked me where I got it.  I told him about the 20% off deal and he stopped and said that was the best deal he had ever seen on a new one (as of Jan 17, 2019). He asked about it and was sad to hear the 20% off was over but noted the 450ish price was decent. So, thumbs up Amazon big time. It works like new, looks like new. The new clear covers now allow your phone to shine through.
            "
"257","I should have took the other reviews seriously because they were right; this is NOT an unlocked phone. It is a locked phone that comes with instructions on how to unlock it. I emailed the seller as soon as I tried to follow the instructions to unlock the phone, which did not work. I received a reply with a new set of instructions, but with a new SIM card from Tracfone which is my carrier, it still would not unlock. I am very disappointed that a seller would advertise as unlocked when the phone clearly indicates it is a Sprint phone and the instructions do not work to unlock the phone. I was hoping to save money by purchasing a refurbished unlocked phone but I will spend the extra money to get a new phone that is actually unlocked.
            "
"258","It states that any SIM card could be used because it was unlocked,  but I've tried 3 different SIM cards, 3 different services, and none of them worked. Wasted money on those plans that I cannot use, the hassle of sending it back, trying to find a printer to print the return label, not to mention. It's a holiday Monday.  I have to wait for my refund to order another phone while my old one is going out, then I will be without.  I am livid right now!!!!
            "
"259","I must admit I was a little hesitant to buy a refurbished unlocked phone from Amazon - but so far, I am glad I did. Amazon have included a 90 day warranty. The phone came in a generic blank box and came with an outlet and power cable. No instructions. There were no scratches or marks on the phone.I was able to transfer all my apps and settings from my S6 to the S9 using Samsung's amazing Smart Switch app. My T Mobile SIM card worked and I am good to go.The only downside (which I dont believe deserves to lose a star) is that all the Sprint stuff, including the Welcome Screen when you power on the phone, is still on the phone and I cant figure out how to turn it off even though I have a TMobile SIM installed. But for $400 less than buying new from a store, I can live with that.I am travelling internationally in a few weeks and hoping the phone still works - but I have confidence that it will.
            "
"260","It's been a month since I had the phone and so far I've had no problems at all.  It was a bit annoying to setup with AT&T at first (It kept telling me the network was not registered, was stuck on Sprint, but I solved the issue by disabling Sprint OMADM) but besides that it works like a charm.  Awesome phone, with a great deal.  It was pretty much like new besides one tiny scratch on the right bottom side that's only noticeable if you look super hard for it in the light.  Very satisfied with my purchase.
            "
"261","Update: I had to pay another $55 to have my phone unlocked. I would definitely not recommend buying. All they told me when I contacted them was to return the phone. I shouldn't have had to return the phone. The description specifically stated that the phone was unlocked. I will never buy from them again.I cannot access this phone. If anything changes then I may change my review. But for the time being, if I had to do it again, I would not purchase this phone.
            "
"262","Received phone, it was in good quality, no marks or scratches. But phone was registered to sprint, not unlocked. I am returning the phone.
            "
"263","Great phone. I updated to this from the Galaxy S6, and I'm loving it. Much better battery life and I really like the quick access for apps and contacts
            "
"264","You will regret purchasing this phone. It¡¯s performance and build quality is nowhere near worth the price. Save yourself the time and money and just buy an iPhone instead. Trust me you will not regret it. An iPhone 7 (which is better than this phone) fully unlocked with 128 gb of storage only costs around $310. I would personally recommend an iPhone X, refurbished 64 gb is around the same price of this phone.
            "
"265","Received the phone but charger was broken.

"271","The phone looked and worked great except that it wasn't unlocked.  It wouldn't register with my carrier and would give these Sprint OMADM errors.  I contacted my carrier and after some troubleshooting, they said that the phone was not unlocked and that I'd need to contact the previous carrier.  I explained that it came from Amazon and not a carrier and they told me to go to Amazon.  Amazon tried to help but even though they spent an hour with me, I could tell that they weren't going to be able to do anything about it aside from helping me process the return.
            "
"272","Phone came with some type of spyware that hijacks 800 numbers and reroutes it. Will not be putting any c/c numbers into phone. Uber card was already stolen.
            "
"273","The phone is ok overall and exactly what you are paying for. This is not a review of the hardware of the phone, it's about the quality of being ""renewed"". It came from the supplier Hybrit it for 370 dollars.It comes in a white carboard box without any brand. The phone itself came wrappead with a bubble wrap that it's ok.The phone in the exterior looks like new, it had a tiny little scrath that I didn't notice it until a search for this things that I had.Rear camera working perfectly but the selfie one is weird, I compared it to a new one mine was a little worse, display is just new, the performance it's excellent with games and media apps. It has a face detection with iris scanner combined and that's the way that I use it to unlock it but the fingerprint it's also great.Some other things that I see that people are complaining about are:1. That it doesn't come unlocked, mine did, I use it in Dominican Republic with Claro perfeclty.2. The battery is the biggest complain that I have because I downloaded an app to see the how used it was and mine came with 88% that is not so bad but they could change it because one battery costs 15$.With normal use it gets a little warm and i don't know if it's the battery or the processor but a new phone wouldn't get that warm, I will change the battery to see if it's that the issue.3. The accessories are just the charger and that's it, the box for the cable I think it's original, but the cable it self it looks like from a gasoline station, you will need to buy a new one because I have to push it hard just to get the phone charging.Would recommend if you don't care that of course it is used and it's a risk that you are taking for a better price.The pictures in the review are from some days later that I had actively using the phone.
            "
"274","Contrary to all the reviews about this phone not being unlocked for verizon, it definately was.  It will take quite a few extra steps.My process, some steps might have no impact-I had the SIM card in the whole time, I'm not sure if that made anything easier or harder than it needed to be.-Call sprint(or who ever your phone says it's carrier is) to unlock your phone.-They will say it's already unlocked.-Connect to wifi and update android until its fully up to date (in settings)-Change APN settings (settings/connections/mobile networks/access point names) to verizon-I made a custom setting by googling ""Verizon apn settings"" and following a tutorial.Since then, my phone has worked perfectly with no signs of previous damage.  A ""New phone"" at quite the discount.  Very satisfied.
            "
"275","I love my phone. It looks brand new. I was able to activate on Verizon network without any issues. I switched from the Iphone 6 to the Galaxy S9 and I love this phone.
            "
"276","Works seamlessly for metro pcs. Used the smart switch and called metro pcs had all my info in the phone within an hour of turning it on. Highly recommended. Looks new and no damage that I seen. Going to upgrade the cord soon to a longer one. Charges good so far and holds the charge better than the old s6.
            "
"277","Ok, I was sceptical after reading reviews.  I expected to get some Mickey mouse packed phone etc.  Let me describe what I got.This looked new, in the factory box, factory charger, all still had wrappers, stickers, labels and packing protection on it all even front back and edges of phone.  If this is a used phone, you wouldn't know it!! Extremely surprised and very happy!
            "
"278","I was so scared to order a renewed phone, but boy am I happy I did! I got an amazing phone for a really good price! I bought the lilac purple S9 and you won't believe how NICE it is! Didn't come in any fancy packaging, and only had a charger with it, but it works great and I'm impressed. I've never enjoyed shopping for these kinds of things online, but I did not regret this purchase! Battery life is wonderful! My screen adjusting is nice quality! No cosmetic issues, no glitches so far, and I was able to put a Straight Talk micro SIM card in and had no real issues with activating it! The only reason I had any difficulty was because I bought the wrong sim by mistake in the beginning. Overall, a wonderful phone. I'll update this is anything changes!
            "
"279","Came as advertised.  It was unlocked and in great condition.  I did have to go get a new SIM card because my old one didn't fit.  It's also important to know that this is a USB c device.  I have to get a bunch of new cables now, but it did come with a cable and charger.
            "
"280","The first thing I want to point out is this phone works with AT&T. When I first booted up it displayed the  ""T-Mobile"" logo. After logging into my Samsung account I installed Samsung Smart Switch and started the data transfer. After 30 mins the transfer was done and I was instructed to insert my SIM and reboot phone. Phone booted up and now displayed the ""AT&T"" logo. Phone works flawlessly, looks brand new, good battery life, and came with OEM Type C charger. Good buy, highly recommend.
            "
"281","I didn't have any issue turning on the phone with metro pcs and the phone is great so far but this is day one .. it didn't come with the right charger but I brought one ahead anyways and it came with a case and pin to open sim . Once I put my sim in the phone ask me to restart and when it came back on it had metro pcs in the beginning and downloaded all the metro pcs apps by itself which was awesome but I still had to call to switch phone which you have to with metro anyways . I'll update if anything happens.

"282","Good unit if you don't cheap out for the refurb.  I initially bought the refurb, and returned it pronto, it was still locked to Sprint.

"287","I have Verizon, and one thing annoying about this is that you can't uninstall some of the Sprint software on it, and it is always in Roaming mode.
            "
"288","Everything was perfect and is brand new looking. The only thing that threw me off was the Box it did not come with the Samsung original  Box. Other than that this phone is very good quality and will probably buy from these people again

"323","I was a little hesitant to go with this, but as of today (April 15th), I'm satisfied. My phone came quickly and seems to be free of any major defect. The phone runs smoothly and I didn't find any scratches or obvious problems with it. I think this is a pretty decent deal for being only one generation behind the current Samsung Galaxy S10. The brand new S9's go for at least $200 more than what I paid for this. If anything changes I'll update this. So far so good though. Also, fwiw, I have Straight Talk.
