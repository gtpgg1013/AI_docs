"1","This is my second s6.  Ruined the original last summer while submerged in the Bitterroot river.  Hot phone, cold river sucked the water into the phone.  Replaced it with a used S5.  Got a good deal(this one) on a refurbished phone.  The phone looked brand new, no scratches and works perfectly.  The S6 is the ultimate smartphone, a finished product.  I enjoy being outdoors and running long distances while listening to music.  The display is excellent and you can see it in direct sunlight.  I use my Garmin 235 with the Garmin Connect software on the phone which turns out to be the perfect combination for outdoor sports.  The camera takes great photo's and it is fast.  Video is excellent.  They have an improved sensor for heartrate, oxygen and stress. Unlike the prior S5, the sensor displays a sine wave and seems to be consistent and accurate.  The glass and metal is a beautiful combo and feels expensive in your hand.  I used an Otter Box on my destroyed S6, while it provides excellent shock resistance, it is not water proof.  Water will destroy this phone, more so than any electronic device I have used in the past..  I purchased a S6 Waterproof Case, Caka [Newest Version] Full-body Underwater Waterproof, for my S6 when I am near water or when it is raining.  the battery seems to last a long time depending on how I am using it.

"2","Save your money and never buy from this sham of a company. I purchased this phone after doing extensive research on what kind of phone I wanted, and this one fit the bill best, so I was excitedly waiting for it to arrive. Activating it on my network wasn't a problem, but I had nothing but problems from then on. For starters, the battery must have been bad because the battery died at a rate of 20-25% per hour during normal use texting and browsing Pinterest. There was a hardware defect in the camera causing permanent blue confetti-like lines in all my photos. When the phone was on the home screen, it would at least once a day vibrate harshly and make a loud noise reminiscent of tuning an old tv to a static channel. I was worried it was going to explode, honestly. I emailed the company around 3pm the day I received the phone about the camera issue and got an automated message saying they were unavailable and to try back during normal business hours. A few days later (around 1pm on a week day) when I had discovered the other defects, I called them. After being put automatically on hold for literally 5 minutes, I got an automated ""We're busy or you called during non-business hours. Call again Mon-Fri, 9-5"". I'd be flabbergasted to learn they actually employ people for customer service because I only got repeated automated messages. There is nothing ""Certified"" about this company's products, and the only thing that might be ""Refurbished"" was the packaging. Take your business elsewhere. I bought a new device from a different vendor after returning this one and am much happier.

"3","Phone freezes all the time, screen goes black and is unresponsive to anything other than a soft restart. I can't go more than an hour without a freeze. Also the charger came broken.
            "
"4","So far so good.  I was a bit hesitant since it was refurbished but it came looking good as new. Easy set up; I am using this phone outside of the US so I had to put my own data network provider in manually, but it was effortless.  The back of the phone doesn't open so the batter can't be changed, well not by you.  And the sim card goes in the side of the phone, no memory card slot, but it has 32 GB of memory.  The only negative thing I have to say about the phone is that it doesn't hold charge for too long it seems.  At least not for a full day.  I definitely have to charge in the morning and afternoon to full power. The camera/picture quality is GREAT!  Crisp and crystal clear, the video zoom is clear also; that was the whole reason I wanted a Samsung.  Oh and I dropped it face down already, day 1 from a good height, ! was certain it was shattered, not a scratch! I do have it nicely protected now.
            "
"5","I bought this phone as a gift for my mother in law because I purchased two last year for my wife and I,  they were just great. It came. Well packed.
            "
"6","My wife and I love this phone and have owned two of these over the past 4 years.  The updated functions you get with a new phone IMO are not worth the extra cost.  I can get 4 of these for the price I would pay for a flagship phone with similar functionality.  Plus I don't have the same level of worry about dropping/losing my $800 phone with this phone! The only reason why we ended up getting new phones were due to cracked screens or drops which damaged the phone.  We have since learned and purchased cases for our phones which should extend the life.
            "
"7","Another refurbish fail.  The battery won't hold a charge, and this phone was not restored to factory settings.  Battery should be replaced with new as part of a refurb.  Very disappointed.  Will never purchase another ""certified refurbished"" item through amazon.  Ends up being more hassle for not much savings.
            "
"8","Unfortunately the phone didn't work as expected. Battery charge didn't last very long (approximately 4 hours on a full charge) and phone got hot when in my husband's pocket and it was not even on. I didn't realize how bad it was until I bought him a different phone. We are past the return date. Would be great if I could exchange or see if it can be fixed, not doing us any good if we can not use it.
            "
"9","This phone arrived quickly and looked great.  I began having weak signal problems right away, however.  I tried changing the SIM, reinstalling the software (including all the updates) and nothing worked.  I had my old phone right beside this one on my desk at work, old phone had 3 bars on 4G, this phone had 1 bar on 3G.  Inside the Verizon office was the only time this phone ever went to 4G and it was only 1 bar.  In my research, during the hours I spent downloading and installing new software, I discovered that some of these phones had an interanl antenna issue.  I decided not to exchange as I thought the odds were high that I might get another one of these.  I decided to shell out the dough for a new S7.
            "
"10","Just got this phone in today and can't even use it, it is signed in to the previous owners Samsung account and completely locked out. Have never been so frustrated with a phone purchase. Now I am sure I will have to pay shipping to return it.Update: Returned the phone and am waiting for a new one, will change my review when I get the new one, hoping the last one was just a one time mistake.
            "
"11","Well I'm glad I didn't write another review.  Would not want others to know I'm having a problem because I really like the phone.  Now I have problems.  I was afraid of that by getting a refurbished phone.  Here in the last week or so when I am texting, the phone will just reboot on me.  It goes to a red Samsung screen.  I lose everything.  I didn't mind at the very beginning because it only happened once or twice.  Now it is happening quite often.  I plugged it in this morning to recharge and when I went to get it and use it, it would not come on.  The blue light was blinking.  I held the ""turn on"" key down and still nothing. I tried 3 different cords.  I only have 90 days to get this resolved, well 6 weeks now.  Can you help me?  I had problems when I first got the phone.  Called Mango and should be on record.  Took to Verizon for help.Thanks, Sandra H Tatum (7/19/2017
            "
"12","Strange why the 32GB version was more expensive than the 64GB version. However, I have no issues with our phone whatsoever.The only downside is the preinstalled Verizon bloatware, but an amazing app in the Google Play Store, the 'BK Samsung Package Disabler' helped stop the Verizon bloatware that's known for installing apps on your phone silently and without permission.After handling the bloatware, the phone is amazingly fast and it's battery lasts for a full day on end.Even though many believe that the battery is non removable. It's easy to get inside the phone by using specific items such as a heat bag and such to slowly pull of the back panel and to get a battery replacement. Just note, I never had to do this with my phone yet; as the battery still seems perfectly healthy with use.I recommend all cell phone users to at least treat their phone battery with the least wear by using a beefy battery bank. Draining your battery daily to around 25%-45% is a way to slowly harm your battery quicker.It's better to drain a battery bank with wear, than a phone battery.
            "
"13","**UPDATE**After having this phone for 7 months, I have to reduce it to 1 star.  I would not buy again.  The charging port has been flakey (as noted in my original review which is in its original form below) and finally gave up.  Now, something I did not know about this phone is that you cannot replace the charging port without replacing the screen as well.  That's not good, because it's $150 to fix it, and even more if I want to replace the battery.I would definitely look elsewhere for a refurbished phone knowing this now.  Lesson learned - know what repair options are available for the phone you are buying refurbished - assume you'll at least have to replace a battery and charging port (and possibly headphone jack) and make sure they don't make your phone a throwaway if you have to do that.** Original review below **This device looks like new, was unlocked and easy to add to my carrier (Verizon) and I have been using it since the day I got it.  The cons:* Battery is not great, pretty good but does not last more than 1 full day, if I don't charge it at night it's dead the next day* Charging port is a little sketchy, you have to be careful putting it down after plugging it in or it will not make a good connectionAll in all, not a bad buy for a decent phone.  Sure beats buying a new one.

"14","Ordered this product on December 30th 2018, received the phone main home button was dirty and had what looked to be brown crust stuck in it. Buttons Alomg the side of the phone had dirt stuck in them as well. Phone was dingy, did not receive a Samsung charger in it, but rather a charger you would buy in a gas station. Battery life was well the biggest downfall. Phone would only charge to 60%, once I take it off the charger it¡¯s at 5% in about twenty minutes and then dies. Doesn¡¯t hold a charge. Purchased a Samsung charger for it to see if the charger they provided was malfunctioned and it¡¯s definitely the battery. Waste of money. Please take this product down !!
            "
"15","Bought the refurbished white S6, looks and operates like brand new. It seems like a new smart phone model comes out every year, but for someone like me who just wanted to upgrade from a flip phone to a smart phone, this was like going from a beater car to a Mercedes. I'm still impressed by it, it has crisp response time to everything I do, has decent audio level for listening to audiobooks while driving (maybe not with the windows down), and has a good battery life, about a day with normal use. But really, I charge in my office and at home, so it's never been an issue. Doesn't have the battery life of an iPhone maybe, but hey I paid $178 for this baby, and I don't think I would have even noticed the difference between this and a $1,000 phone. The difference would have been lost on me completely. I use the phone for light mobile gaming, music, calls/texts, snapchat, etc. and it does everything fast and reliably.
            "
"16","So far it seems ok. There's a few blue spots on the front cam that I think are dead pixels.The battery life isn't the vast either.But it doesn't freeze like my s5 did.
            "
"17","Battery life is extremely short!
            "
"18","Was worried Id receive a phone that wasnt thoroughly tested but after a week Im happy.  Within 15 minutes of getting the phone I had it connected to walmarts total wireless network.  Another half hour later the data was working.  I did have to call total wireless support to get the APN pushed to the phone correctly.  Battery life is average.. the s6 isnt known for a great battery.  I bought the gold phone and it didnt even have a scratch on it.  The only issue I had is there was a day delay in shipping.. no big deal, amazon communicated the delay and all was well.  I refuse to pay over $200 for a phone and this worked out perfect.. the s6 is a great phone for the money... unless you are one of those who has to look like you have the best in front of your friends.  Oh, I charge the phone in a wireless charger and no heat issues.. just a great phone.
            "
"19","Very good phone for the price since it works so much better then the galaxy s5 in speed and multi tasking. I am able to use things like messagneger, YouTube, and the internet app at the same time all running well with multi split screen. The charger that comes with it is 3rd party wall plug but 1st party in the cable, making the claim it is just like a new phone not as close. The phone it self is like new with no damage on any side of it with every feature working like new. The lack of a sd card is not that big of deal if you back up photos and songs and don't have huge games or way more then a few apps. The battery is good enough to last the whole day if it starts out at 100 and is not used hard. The ultimate disadvantage this phone has for my old s5 is the lack of just putting a new battery in since it is now sealed.The wireless charging works great even in a defender case that had plastic under rubber. I never really notice the phone getting really hot with the case on it so holding it is comfortable.Overall if you are looking for a phone that can do everything you need to do under $200 and won't break or lockup easily, pick this phone up with a defender case form otter box, a glass screen protector if you drop your phone a lot , a battery pack and a fast charger if you are a heavy user.
            "
"20","I purchased the phone and the SIM would not read. I even took it to Verizon to get help but was not able to get it running. I returned it for another one and same problem occurred. I could not, in good conscience, recommend this vendor. Sorry.

"21","This was a Sweet Deal!!The S6 is a great phone for all.Smooth operation. Great camera. Split-screen.Everything about Samsung S6 is beautiful ly laid out for the user. Quick action. Great design also.The phone you can count on. At an amazing price,under $200!! Certified refurbished. Don't miss out on a tremendous deal!!Get one Now.
            "
"22","I bought this in August and by November it started shutting off. I turned it back on by holding down the three reset buttons.  But by December it started shutting down and not turning back on even after hitting the reset buttons.  The battery would also drain quickly and the wifi/mobile data didn't work as well as my previous Samsung Galaxy 4 or my current Galaxy S7. Maybe that's the problem with used phones.  The only reason I kept it for this long was because I had another phone through a local low-cost store and that phone has unlimited data and I had very few problems with wifi/mobile data. I wasted $200.
            "
"23","I love the phone and it's been very reliable. The camera is amazing! There were no marks, scratches or blemishes on mine. I held off for a while before I reviewed it to make sure it wasn't going to die on me. So far, so good... :)
            "
"24","I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S4, and the improvements are quite noticeable. This refurbished phone shows no wear. The battery seems adequate, although I do not spend much time on it. I had one minor problem with the charging port--the fit was loose and I had to push the connector in with some force to get a connection. Because of this I could not charge the phone when it was hanging on the dashboard in my car. I called Amazon and they said to take it to a repair shop and they would reimburse me. I did and all it needed was a clean out of the port and a new charging cord which had been damaged by the condition of the port. Amazon was true to their word. The phone is like new and I'm very happy with it. UPDATE: After about six weeks of use the phone began to shutdown and would not come back on.  I found instructions for turning it back on with alternative reboot methods. It was shutting down about once per day which was tolerable, but at about two months, it began shutting down after only minutes or seconds. I'm happy this happened within the Amazon 90-day warranty so I mailed it back to Kiss Electronics who accepted my return with no questions asked.
            "
"25","This phone is amazing! I was initially very scared to order this because when it did it had no reviews for it but I'm glad I did! I've had it for about two months and it works amazing. I can honestly say this is the best phone I ever owned. It was easy to connect it with straight talk and I definitely do not regret my purchase
            "
"26","This phone is okay.  I bought this one to replace my Galaxy S5.  I also bought the same phone for my husband.  He has glitches where certain programs and built-in apps do not work at all or do not work properly.  Same goes for mine.  The screen on my phone has a ""background"" where it looks as though there is another screen behind it constantly.  It's just enough for me to notice that it is there. It's not bad enough for me to go through the hassle of replacing the phone. Guess that's what I get for purchasing refurbished phones.  It's always hit and miss.
            "
"27","The phone came in a weird package but I have to say the phone looks flawless. It works great and I had no problems getting it set up with Verizon.  I was worried by some of the reviews but I took a chance. I gave it 3 stars because the charger it came with isn't the original one and it takes forever to charge. I had to purchase a different one.
            "
"28","Works great, it came in pristine condition. I've used it everyday for a year. Only complaint is after I bought it I got spam calender notifications (which I later found out that anybody with your email can create because Google made it that way, very insecure on Google's part). I disabled the setting in my email that made this possible (which was on on my previous phone with no problem). I recommend factory reseting any phone you buy online yourself, just to make sure it's 100% clean software wise.
            "
"29","So I decided to upgrade from my s4 that I was holding onto due to the power button trying to give up the ghost on me. I found this unlocked Samsung Galaxy S6 in GOLD and was intrigued.When it arrived, I added the SIM Card, got it activated with my carrier (pagepluscellular.com) and started adding my info to it. It was that easy. So far I am very pleased. I haven't had to charge it yet since I got it. I will probably do that this evening.It comes with the phone, the charger cord, brick (for the wall) and the little device to access the card holder.
            "
"30","Ordered from 3rd Party Seller so I was a little worried. Product looked find upon arrival.  I'm not a ""Techy"" so I asked a friend check it out. He opened all the settings and confirmed it has latest security and updates. I  downloaded apps and made a couple of phone calls; no issues.  This is my first ""smart"" device with all the bells and whistles so I really don't have anything to compare it to. Thus far, it has exceeded my expectations with ease of use and function-ability.  I'm huge fan of Amazon, so I will probably always be an Android guy
            "
"31","So far so good! This refurbished Samsung Galaxy 6 arrived in pristine condition.a. The display is sharp and clear, as expected.b. Initially, I was a bit concerned about how quickly the battery got hot. I turned on ""Medium power saving mode"" and it has seemed better ever since.c. I like the 16MP camera, with features like slow or fast motion and virtual 360-degree photos, as well as the capacity to apply ""Pro"" settings.c. No possibility for additional memory card, but I hope 32GB will be enough.d. I purchased it for use in New Zealand, as an unlocked phone. I wasn't sure how to set it for use with my mobile provider, but eventually I got it up and running. For anyone with similar concerns:Under Settings, choose ""Mobile networks"" --> As preferred ""Network mode,"" my local service rep picked GSM (specifically, ""LTE / GSM / UMTS"")  However, at some point, the device automatically reset itself to ""GLOBAL"". Not sure what's optimal?--> Under ""Access Point Names,"" choose ""ADD"" and manually enter the name of your provider. I only filled in the ""Name"" and ""APN"" fields, leaving everything else as ""Not set"" or the default. It seems to be working fine. ?__?However, I think I probably need to refine these settings further, at some point.All in all, very happy with the purchase, especially after adding a tempered glass shield and rubber case so I don't break it, like my last phone.
            "
"32","Battery bad, only lasts an hour or so.  Takes 8 hours to charge with the supplied charger.  Micro usb port is loose so most cords just fall out.  When I complained, the seller said it would cost $20 to replace the battery.  He was off by a lot it will cost $70-80 to replace the battery and I have no idea how much it would cost to fix the USB charging connector.  I really want a replacement, but the only option is to return.  Then my daughter would be without a phone for too long.
            "
"33","I actually love this phone model...however, though it was certified refurbished, it did not update APPS or did it update or show updates available for the systems operation.  It also did not back up properly.  In addition, after shutting the phone off and restarting, I could not receive calls or texts until I initiated a call.  I discovered this after numerous tests to confirm.If the new models work properly this is a good phone, I believe.
            "
"34","The phone came and looked great. I kept it packed up for a couple weeks to give to me daughter for her birthday. Turns out the battery life is only approx 5. hrs and the aux. port doesn't work. Saw my 'return window' was closed, so not thrilled with my purchase. I have bought refurbished phones before with great results, but got burned this time.
            "
"35","The phone arrived in good shape looks like new, works well but the battery does not last a day. I removed many apps, I did not download Facebook because I thought it would make things worse, there's no reason the battery shoulbd not last longer than it is. I'm assuming the battery is bad I have contacted their customer support we will see what happens?Update... Seller responded almost immediately and offered several options, one was to send another phone. Once I receive the new phonei will update my rating.
            "
"36","The phone came a day early which was wonderful. The SIM card we had did not fit. No problem. We went to the Verizon store to get a new SIM card and activate the phone while we were there. Turns out the phone is not unlocked. It was very disappointing. Right now I am waiting on a request to get it unlocked. If it doesn't work, it will obviously be going back. It specifically said Verizon and UNLOCKED so I figured there wouldn't be an issue. Phone looks like it's in great condition so if I can get it unlocked, it was worth it. I just dislike the extra hoops.**Update** Since the phone is an AT&T phone even with the unlock code it still will not work with Verizon. The extra trips to the Verizon Store were frustrating and inconvenient. The Amazon Tech I spoke with was friendly and helpful, but still without a phone and not sure I want to make the gamble of ordering another phone. All around really disappointing.
            "
"37","I am very pleased with the phone. It is in near mint condition (just minor scuffing on the hoe button) and works well. Would definitely recommend!
            "
"38","Got the phone back in May, it came in good condition. Worked fine. Battery life is crap but that's to be expected of the galaxy S6.  Then last night I left it plugged in laying on my nightstand, and come morning the screen wouldn't turn on. Phone still buzzes and gets notifications and stuff, but the screen just stays black. Tried just about every fix I could find online to no avail, it must just have a faulty screen that was overlooked when the phone was being refurbished. Purchase at your own risk.
            "
"39","Had to finally change phones from my Iphone 5C to this as I was just about done dealing with apple nonsense and terrible operating system and over priced phone.I will say there is an adjustment coming from apple IOS to droid. Lots to learn and somethings are not as intuitive as the Iphone but the droid is more customizable and operates much better than the iphone even years after this model was new. I'm not the type to get a new phone every year just because I don't care about having the latest and greatest thing. I like my stuff to work for years. Its also nocibly bigger (screen size) lighter and thinner than the 5C i had. has a one hand function which is nice because of the bigger screen its harder to use with one had but there is a function to down size the display for one hand operation.There's a nifty feature I didn't notice but I eventually turned it off as it became annoying. Basically it has a sensor that assumes its in your pocket if its dark and turns off the display which is frustrating in dark rooms/areas/cars when lighting is minimal. Just turn it off, its meant to save battery and stop you from activating apps while in a pocket or purse I guess.4 Stars because a perfect phone wouldn't need a case, would be shatter resistant and shock proof as well as water proof absent of a case. Its annoying that guerrilla glass exists and sealing off the phone from water is possible yet a big company like Samsung doesn't automatically do it, at least not on this model. I got it refurbished and it was like new. I don't believe in 5 stars unless there is nothing that can be improved upon but there are some things that could be and that's why it loses a star. Otehr than that great phone and very customization down to battery saving features.
            "
"40","The phone works and seems ok..its a bit glichy and the screen has an image burned into it.  I tried contacting the seller about it to no avail.  No response. Its not worth the hassle to raise a big stink..i just live with it.  I have bought refurbished phones before, and been very happy.  I am less than impressed with this one.
            "
"41","Phone does not keep charge keeps freezing and shutting down this seller is selling bad refurbishing phone's that are not working save your money and headache DO NOT BUY  gave this phone as a gift and im seriously embarrassing for me
            "
"42","arrived on time, setup went perfectly. the phone itself was in near mint condition (and it was the ""good"" condition option) the only thing that pointed to it being used was slight scratches around the charging port but nothing very noticeable at all. super fast, great camera, clear screen, etc. all around great phone. this particular one was from ""BREED"" btw
            "
"43","returned the phone the day after receiving it because you could not hear out of the earpiece. it has been 4 weeks and still no reply to emails or refund. unable to find any working number!

"44","I recently switched from AT&T to Verizon but my current phone was an AT&T exclusive phone so I needed to purchase a phone that was supported by Verizon. I read the reviews and decided to go with the ""certified refurbished"" Galaxy S6. The phone was delivered later than expected. When I took the phone into Verizon, they could not find the phone in their database. They told me usually with certified refurbished phones, they'll have a barcode that can be scanned to find the phone. Even though this phone had Verizon written on the back and when you turned it on, Verizon could not locate the phone to activate it on their system. On top of that, when the Verizon representative researched the phone, it came up as an S5 not and S6. I am definitely returning this phone. My fiance bought an S6 as well, and even though they were able to find his phone in the system, the phone went into an infinite loop and would not go past the start up screen. He didn't even get to use the phone at all so he'll be returning his as well.
            "
"45","Not at all disapointed with this product. Received in very good condition; hard to tell it's used. Easy to set up and once I switched frequency, SIM was recognized and registered to local network without a hitch.
            "
"46","recieved this phone and right out of the box it had loud camera sounds from the lens when it automatically focuses. I called support they told me to turn off shutter sound. didnt fix the problem. then the next day, with full battery, ten min later It was down to 17%. now the screen keeps flickering and going from 100% to 3% in a matter of minutes. putting it in the box to return. waste of money
            "
"47","Cosmetically in great condition I bought a refurbished Samsung galaxy S6 phone just 3 months ago. It worked fine until today.  It has a frozen Verizon screen and will not shut off or reboot though I tried 3 times following instructions on line. I removed the SIM card and put back in several times. I took it to 3 phones stores and 3 people tried to help me but it is unfixable. Everything is lost and locked in my frozen, dead phone. I spent 200$ on that phone and it only worked for 3 months. It was not worth it at all.!!  I am out of my 200$ and have no phone.
            "
"48","The center/home button stopped working after 30 days, the blue notification light does not work, and the screen has a glitch when scrolling through text messages, also has a glitch when you look at the screen in the dark. The phone ALWAYS says extended network and i can hardly make/recieve calls/messages. Its not the carrier because this is the only phone that does this. Its as if its incapable of connecting to any signal. I've never had problems in the past but this phone is the worst refurbished phone I've ever purchased.
            "
"49","Exactly two days after the return date (30 days) it stopped charging wirelessly and within a couple more days it stopped rapid charging. Absolutely not worth the hassle to buy a refurbished device. I am now out a couple hundred dollars and I have to buy another phone.
            "
"50","It froze on me when I was setting it up. Couldn't do anything. Ended up having to do a factory restart on it and reset it back up again. The battery dies way too quick. I think if your on it just messing around it may have a battery life of about 2 hours? I bought it it for my son for his birthday. It shipped in about 2 days.Update just gave my son this phone for his birthday and I showed him how to change the background and it froze again. Why? This phone is crap!
            "
"51","Product is defective. I contacted the company but they ask me to send it back. Due to the fac that I need a phone and can¡¯t send it back is hard for me to get a replacement.The phone keeps on asking for updates even after you update the phone. My pictures always come out blurry and I¡¯m unable to swipe and look at the pictures I¡¯ve taken.The only reason I gave it a two is because it makes and receives calls pretty good.
            "
"52","Wonderful phone/mini computer!  My only complaint (hence 4 not 5 stars) is that in certain locations the phone coverage is terrible.  These are areas which I have used the same provider for years with never this bad of a coverage.  Most other areas the phone works great in though.
            "
"53","I was a little concerned about buying refurbished, but, so far, so good! I love this phone! I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 16GB, to this Galaxy S6 64GB, and it's wonderful! Thank you for making these reasonably priced phones available to the public!
            "
"54","I bought two, for my wife and for me, and all I have to say is almost a year after we still have them, great condition, zero problems so far. Very happy with this purchase.
            "
"55","You always gamble with refurbished, dont be fooled. I have returned more than 1 refurbished phone that wasnt quality checked.With that being said my S6 was fine, it's for my daughter. I love my S8 but wasn't going to drop the <U+0001F4B5><U+0001F4B0><U+0001F4B5><U+0001F4B0>. So, a GREAT phone for her, or anyone, but keep in mind it will NOT take a Micro SD to increase memory, I would suggest the 64GB version or an S7.
            "
"56","Good afternoon... The battery for the phone is faulty, so therefore the phone is not keeping charge, and I¡¯m really upset... I need a new battery right away... I need to know if this phone supposed to come with and ear piece, because I didn¡¯t get any... Please send it to this address... I would like for you to email me (careydannielle@yahoo.com), after you send it please.
            "
"57","Nothing but problems with the phone and it also said it was reported stolen.
            "
"58","I bought this S6 to replace my S7 that broke a week after I got it.  Although Samsungs tend to be fragile, this one is holding up fine.  The battery is weak though and is dead within 12 hours with average use.  Additionally, the charge typically goes from 15% to dead in less than 5 minutes, although sometimes it will stay at 5% for an extended period of time--very inconsistent and unreliable.  The charger that came with it is cheap.  Even when I use the factory charger, the phone sometimes doesn't charge properly.  I like the Android operating system, but the battery issues overshadow that.
            "
"59","I waited for two months after the exchange policy to set up the phone.  And it was dead..battery charge symbol comes up and that's all.  I'm screwed, of course, but if I can keep others from buying this phone, then I'll give it a shot.  Oh, and don't buy the warranty either. It's worthless.
            "
"60","Phone is garbage to say that every phone is inspected is a lie. Ordered this phone for my son for Christmas and when he opened it on Christmas morning he went to turn it on and the phone was completely dead so we went to charge it up with the supplied cord and it wouldn't work so we had to use a cord we already had. After the phone completely charged we went to turn the phone on and it is stuck on the Verizon screen.
            "
"61","This battery is so bad i dont think the energizer bunny could help it. Phone was pretty good but sending back because i dont sit at a desk all day that i can keep it charged
            "
"62","Great phone. Works well and was definitely a quality product for the price. We've actually ordered 4 of them in the last year because we've broken them (cracked a couple screens, went swimming with one) but liked them so much we ordered another.
            "
"63","I received the original S6 only to learn it didn't want to stay connected to the cell phone tower nearest our house. So I called the support line and got a replacement. The replacement work for a total of about 3 weeks before encountering the same issues. Now I am unable to return the phone for a refund even though the second one is still under its warranty and I am unable to get it replaced because the support link has been disabled. Do not buy an S6 it will not stay connected to your local Tower
            "
"64","This item stopped working about 10 hours after it was charged. The screen went completely blank and could not be turned back on.  The charger piece was used and barely fit with the charger.  I returned this right away and now more than a week later I have still not been refunded
            "
"65","Only had it a few days, but so far have been very happy. Arrived quickly, unit works. I took it to my Verizon store and had them do the transfer of information (no cost). It was a very simple way to get a new phone. No problems at all!
            "
"66","Set up was easy and quick and have not had a problem with the phone.  Seller description of product was dead on.only had phone about a week, all in all everything is great.  Should I have any problems will repost.  Very pleased.
            "
"67","So far this phone has locked up on me 4x ... So in my opinion it's a piece of scrap. And I don't believe it was completely refurbished, because there were still apps on that didn't come with the phone. And other things that the phone remembers that shouldn't be there.
            "
"68","It is full of ad software. Right in the middle of doing something on this phone I have to sit through a 30 second ad which I  can't get out of before returning to what ever I was doing. It i infected with adware. No battery life either and the local repair shop charges $80 for a new battery
            "
"69","I wanted a Verizon phone, not expensive, but with sufficient memory. This fits the bill. It works great but I cannot determine whether battery life/drain is normal or excessive. BT or Wi-Fi seem to drain it faster than a less capable phone. Refurbisher cannot comment other than battery is checked.
            "
"70","I've not had this phone a month yet. For some reason I can't use the charger that came with it. It will barely charge if I put it on a wireless charger and it doesn't keep a charge through the day when I'm barely on it. I want to return it but my only option is to return it and not get the money back until 5 business days after they receive it back plus be without a phone. I would not recommend this to anyone.
            "
"71","Although, battery life goes quickly due to how I use it, it has amazing camera quality  and settings I love with adequate photo editing!The screen quality ha bested most of the phones I've had. Thank you very much! ^_^
            "
"72","I ordered this phone to put it on my straight talk plan. Phone has worked great and I have had it for about 3 months. I have also ordered a second phone for my husband and he has also not had any issues with his.
            "
"73","This phone rock, had the gs4 and it finally melted in my pocket after 3 years of use, decided to buy a refurbished gs6 instead of the new gs7 or 8, this phone looks like brand new I'd never know if it wasn't refurbished.  Would highly recommen these guys thanks again!
            "
"74","Not great. It has had charging issues from the start. It will probably go into the trash soon
            "
"75","The phone is nice, but I have had repeated ""No SIM card detected issues. I ordered from Breed and the issue is intermittent  so it could have been missed in Quality Assurance. I am returning and have ordered a replacement.  I will update review after hearing from customer service.
            "
"76","I purchase this phone and it did not state anywhere that it was a locked phone so I'm very disappointed
            "
"77","So my old phone was dying by degrees, replacing it with a new one, now that the phone companies don't subsidize was not monetarily feasible.  This refurbished phone has made life so much easier.  It charges in a flash, and makes my work/on the go entertainment so much easier.  For some reason it took me a long time to think of getting a refurbished model, but no regrets.  Works as well as a new phone and isn't ridiulously costly.
            "
"78","NEW phone - same problem.  I spent over $200 on this product and it just decided one day that it was not going to work.  Now I have to come out of pocket again for yet another phone, since the Verizon store told me there was nothing they could do for me.  I've never had a problem with phones until this one.  Waste of money and very dissapointed
            "
"79","Great value for the price. Phone like new, only downside the battery life is poor...seldom can I go a whole day without getting below 50% down.
            "
"80","Works better than the one I lost, because it has a new battery. Can't beat the price and reliability.
            "
"81","Beautiful phone, horrible battery life and reception.
            "
"82","It worked like a top of the line phone. Lighting fast, run dreamcast emulators on it and in the process of getting gamecube emulator working. But I dropped it after delaying getting a case and I cracked the whole back side of the phone. It didn't work as fast and ok google doesn't always pick up voice anymore. It has recently started running a little faster though. 5 stars cause it's my fault it got hindered
            "
"83","Had this phone only 5 months and it completely died after fairly light use. Unable to even get it to turn on now. Even prior to this the phone was working terribly. Got locked up all the time and Would only respond again after a reset. Many of the basic functions (like the keyboard, camera, and email) would suddenly stop working mid-use. Terrible phone and a total waste of money.
            "
"84","Really pleased with the samsung s6 refurbished phone, have experienced no problems. Would highly recommend this phone for anyone searching for a goid buy.
            "
"85","Its a shame that products like this are up to sale in AMAZON. The phone worked for just 16 days until sudden death happened. My money was stolen by this provider and AMAZON for sure has he¡¯s amount of guilt by not supervising the product.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY IN PRODUCTS LIKE THIS. And more than that I won¡¯t trust AMAZON as I use to!!!
            "
"86","Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised! Looks like new. My 10 year old broke his $600 moto z droid and we replaced it with this! He loves it! Switched SIM cards and was up and working in minutes!
            "
"87","I'll never buy one refurbished again.... over heats will not call out or receive calls...¡¦¡¦¡¦. just a peace of -------.
            "
"88","After a lot of research and due to his limited budget, my son who is heading off to college chose this make/model and is very pleased with this refurbished phone. It looks new and he thinks it works great.
            "
"89","Perfect for teenager on straight talk.  No issues or concerns.  Good battery.
            "
"90","The phone looked beautiful but It had issues with person on the other end hearing me. I ended up returning it. I didn't have time to get it fixed, neither should I have had to since it was supposed to be completely functional.
            "
"91","I bought this phone in June and it's now November. At the 3 month mark it started trying to update and I would run the update for a half hour and when it was done, it would tell me to update the software. It also overheats and powers down and restarts itself 2-4 times a day and when it restarts it can take several additional restarts to actually function or run any apps. I've taken it to Verizon and was told i was scammed and sold a bad phone. Don't waste your money, it will barely survive the warranty.
            "
"92","If I could give zero stars I would. The phone did come quickly but it doesn't matter how quickly you get the product if it doesn't work properly. It took over six hours to charge to 98% then literally died due to low battery within 4 hours of less then minimal use. Every app or site I tried ran super slow and my phone was constantly really hot to touch. I'm in the process of returning now.
            "
"93","Nice phone. I have always used Samsung phones and had good luck with them. Hopefully this one will give my daughter a long service life.
            "
"94","The phone itself functions well, and I've never had an issue with it freezing up, being slow or anything involving the software.Only thing negative about this phone is the battery. If I'm on the phone a lot, then it won't last half the day. If I'm not on it much, it still drains the battery. Either way, the battery life is not good. Other than that, it did good. But still that battery though..
            "
"95","Great phone for the price. Charges crazy fast with the charger included. Camera takes amazing pictures.
            "
"96","This is a terrific phone, and for the money, you can't beat it.  Super clear pictures and the phone works flawlessly. Recommend purchasing this phone.
            "
"97","Very good just as described by seller. Very happy.  I wish it had came with new  earphones since  my daughter goes thru them like water.
            "
"98","Excellent phone have not had an issue yet honestly has so much space I've downloaded just about every app I thought to be entertaining and still have loads of storage
            "
"99","First off let me say I've been with Apple for around 7 years and it was finally time to go back to android.Needless to say I love this phone, I received it on Saturday (7/14/18) and I'm in love with it. My ONLY complaint is that it does not hold a charge. I can unplug it, not even touch it and it'll lose battery power. Example: My boyfriend unplugged my phone around 6AM this morning while I was asleep, I woke up around 8AM and checked my phone and it was at 97% without me even using it.
            "
"100","Dont bother buying this phone refurbed.  This was my second, the first crashed within 30 days.  This phone died in less than 3 months.
            "
"101","Shipped on time. Works Great! The phone looks brand new and works like it's brand new. Very satisfied with the phone and the price I paid. Well worth it.
            "
"102","Don't buy this phone. Literally 10 days after my ability to return this phone expired, the phone completely died. It won't turn on, charge or anything!! It lasted 2 months almost to the day. A lot of money to pay for a phone lasting only 2 months!! Buy new with a warranty, not refurbished.
            "
"103","Works great.
            "
"104","Waste of Time and Money. I bought the phone less than a month ago and already the phone will randomly die on me. Finally my phone just completely turned off and wont start back up even when plugged in. The tech team does not respond to you. Only buy this phone if you are looking to waste your money. In fact it would be more beneficial to just burn your money that way you will actually get something from it.
            "
"105","Works perfectly. Moved SIM card from old phone and restored saved info from cloud and it was good to go!
            "
"106","Dont buy from this seller. The phone will randomly go black and not be able to turn back on. It will show a light purple light flashing but won't turn back on or do anything. You have to factory reset it and lose everything you had on it including pictures and contacts.
            "
"107","Not the latest model, but very satisfied and cant beat the price. Does everything i need
            "
"108","Not happy with this at all. Phone would not ring when A call came in. Then when I saw one come in and could answer it I couldn't hear the person calling. I didn't like the phone even when things were working correctly. I did however receive it quickly.Thank you
            "
"109","Ordered this for a Christmas gift. Turned it on as soon as it got here and started setting it up so it could be used once it was opened. It shut off on me multiple times as I tried setting it up. And it will say it's fully charged while on the charger, but I take it off and it turns off and says 0%. Going to have 1 majorly disappointed person Christmas morning!!!
            "
"110","Phone only worked about 20 minutes until it froze up, was unable to do anything at all.  Finally got it to return to home screen, once there I was unable to open anything at all except phone keypad, as soon as I hit send to place the very first call, the phone shut down and would not come back on.
            "
"111","Phone is good, in good condition, runs current aps and has a good camera.
            "
"112","Bought this phone to replace my wife's old S3 so I don't see it much but haven't had any complaints from her yet.  The phone  was in excellent condition and restored to new factory setup.  Simply went to Verizon for a sim card and set the phone up later that evening when she got home.  Would absolutely buy from them again, obviously hoping for the same results.
            "
"113","Phone came in a standard phone box with a 2ft USB charging cord and 120VAC wall adapter. Called Verizon with S/N of phones (bought 2 for the kids) they sent nano sim cards, installed into phones, they work great.
            "
"114","Was it pretty good phone I got it as a secondary phone and it worked great until I broke it LOL. Typical Samsung product works like a top
            "
"115","The phone works however the screen has red blotches embedded in it.  Which is only an issue when I am on light colored pages, but I wished I had never bought it.  The bad thing is I use this phone or no phone.  It took forever to get my items moved from old phone to this one and then I noticed the bad screen, the battery life isn't very good either.
            "
"116","I bought two of these. One last year for myself and one this year for my dad. Mine works great, transition with SIM card was tricky. My dad's came as an S7 for some strange reason.
            "
"117","Got this product yesterday...very sceptical at first...coz it's refurbished but I'm pleasantly surprised...fairly new looking, no cracks, scratches, very impressed with camera. Only thing is takes a lil longer to charger but other than that I'm a happy camper...for now anyway
            "
"118","When I received my phone I couldn't believe what great condition it was in . I thought I received a brand new phone. Great buy.
            "
"119","Great condition; was a little worried about an error message regarding the fingerprints, but after restarting the phone a few times for other reasons, it worked just fine. After a quick call with my carrier to fix the lack of mobile connection, everything worked great! I definitely appreciated the directions for non-Verizon SIM cards, that was very helpful :)Now to see if it continues to act like a 'like new' phone!
            "
"120","Phone got very hot when charging and texting and during phone calls and battery did not stay charged at all had to charge every hour and a half.  The phone looks good but I need one that works.
            "
"121","Phone came and it seems to be very good for being refurbished. The battery isn't great, but I didn't expect it to work like it was 100 percent new. The only issue is I got one with a minor OIS problem with the camera where it makes a rattling noise, but it doesn't affect the quality of the photos. Overall I'm happy with what I got for the price I paid.
            "
"122","It was a terrible purchase and I regret a lot, because I bought it to use in Brazil and I can not change it before April 2018. The cell phone is not working as it should, it is locking, the screen darkens with each incoming call and done and when I try to watch the video on watsapp the screen keeps blinking continuously unable to complete the operation, because it does not give me the option to pause. In addition, I received the product missing the protective cover that was announced that accompanied the cell phone.
            "
"123","So Far I Am In Love With My Phone..
            "
"124","We like the Galaxy 6 very much. Good phone system. Easy to learn to use. Only down side with this particular one, is when she takes pictures(bought for my teenage daughter) there are small purple discoloration marks on every picture. Someone told me that means the camera lens is scratched. Not sure if that s accurate.
            "
"125","Quick delivery.  My son has been using the phone for 6 months and he is very happy with it.  Battery has been holding up well.
            "
"126","The volume on this phone doesn't work and neither does the vibrate function.  I purchased the phone for my dad, who doesn't hear well, so the non-functioning volume is a deal-killer.  Returning and getting another one.  Hoping the new (used) phone works better.Cosmetically, the phone is perfect!  Looks good, no scratches.
            "
"127","Not the sellers fault but this phone will not work with SIM cards from India
            "
"128","The phone was great but they sent me a generic charger and USB cord and every time I plug my phone in it charges slow and tells me to use the proper plug if I want it to charge faster
            "
"129","Like new condition you can tell it doesn't have the oem battery but it's not bad unless you watch videos all day update several months later still good
            "
"130","Seems as good as S7. I should have read more specifics. Didn't know sd card needs adapter like iPhone
            "
"131","Had this phone for a few months now and have had any issues.
            "
"132","Replacement phone for one stolen. Like this phone a lot.

"133","I bought this phone for my stepmom. She loves it.
            "
"134","Phone is solid and functions great.  It is much better than my old S4...  Looks new and performs as new...
            "
"135","Phone seems to function fine.  I liked flip phones but verizon does not allow to activate old style flip phone so money for this or a new flip phone was the same.  I am getting used to smart phone.
            "
"136","The phone came in good condition. However, the battery life SUCKS!!!! I would not recommend this product from this seller.
            "
"137","Functions very well and the battery doesn't heat.
            "
"138","Great phone for the price. The one I received is an unlocked world phone. Received in New condition.
            "
"139","Received just as it was described - very happy with my purchase and will try to shop with you again!
            "
"140","Love my S6 and very happy with my purchase.  Love that they called me to follow up with my purchase!!!
            "
"141","Phone keeps locking up and rebooting.  Had it less than 60 days and I've had to factory reset it twice.  We are no stranger to cell phones but there is something wrong with this one and it is going back for a replacement.  The volume isn't as loud as I would have thought it would be either.
            "
"142","Bought this as a development phone for our work.  It works great and it was almost half price.  Can't beat that!
            "
"143","phone glitches, battery doesn't charge. can't return because return window passed
            "
"144","Minor scratching on the frame and a lot of marks around the charging port. Also some strange glitch were my battery percent will change when I plug it in but it does not cause issues.
            "
"145","This S6 seemed to work fine for all of 6 hours as I backed up my info to it from the cloud. Suddenly it powered down, remained at 0%, no matter how much I tried to charge it and how many chargers I used; the light from the charger would never turn on and the phone recognized it was being charged but it never moved past 0% and never came back to life. Will be returning for refund. Disappointing.
            "
"146","for a refurbished phone I expected it to be acceptable yet not perfect. That being said the battery life went from a fully charged 100% to 50% within a few hours with very minimal next to no use. Item returned
            "
"147","Ok phone just what I expected
            "
"148","Very good upgrade for me, volume is awesome on calls and the camera crisp!
            "
"149","Im happy with my new, well used phone, but it feels new to me. One thing though, is sometimes when I try to slide up to open the lock screen it just seems turns off as if I pressed the power button, to be clear i dont mean power off just turn off. Don't know why that happens, little irritating but it doesn't happen alot and it's a small thing to me.
            "
"150","Phone works fine. Happy with it.  Wish it took a SD card for storage but 32 gb internal has allowed me to do what I want so far.

"151","phone was not compatible with my SIM card
            "
"152","looks nice and new
            "
"153","Had the phone for 2 days and now the screen won't stay on and goes crazy flashing white 210$ down the drain. No physical damage done to the phone
            "
"154","This is one of three that I have bought, great phones, going on two years service, they were all in new shape.
            "
"155","Just buy the 7 and thank me later.
            "
"156","Little disappointed the battery doesn¡¯t last enough even if I don¡¯t use it too much during the day, the stand by battery period is so short
            "
"157","Works great!
            "
"158","Older version, but works super well.  Will keep for as long as I can.
            "
"159","I was very happy with this phone.  It was factory reset so it was easy to set up to my own settings once I got it.  It came in the original box and with a charger.  I am very happy with the seller.  It was delivered promptly and in perfect condition.
            "
"160","I loved this phone. Unfortunately it fell out of my pocket into water like 3 months after I bought it and it stopped working. I had to switch back to my old phone.
            "
"161","I had to replace the battery immediately as it had a very limited life of only about 12 hours with not a high app or phone usage. I also had to deal with a lot of Verizon issues of unwanted apps that would not in any case work here in South Africa. I will not buy an american sourced used phone again, very disappointing.
            "
"162","Received the phone within a few days of ordering and was very pleased to see the phone look as if it was flawless. I mean it looked as if it was new, no scratches or marks any wear on the phone. Did find that the charger it came with was not working correctly, emailed there customer support and without hesitation shipped me a new charger free of charge. Was pleasantly surprised with my order and would highly recommend them in the future.
            "
"163","Really like it. Old farts can learn too
            "
"164","The phone didn't work at all. The software installed on the device was no good. Would stay on for a few seconds then shut right back off. It was my first time purchasing a refurbished phone and i have to say this company ruined it for me. Never again.
            "
"165","Took a minute to learn all the great features
            "
"166","Phone didn't come with a oem charger but an aftermarket 1amp charger. Not even suitable for the phone.  1.5amp is what Samsung requires.  Then the phone is NOT unlocked.  I'm going to Verizon tomorrow and if they don't unlock it I'll be returnimg this and lowering my review stars.
            "
"167","got here on time and looked new it is amazing
            "
"168","good product, just as described
            "
"169","This phone is terrible. I don't know who refurbished it, but they did not do a good job. It constantly glitches, applications quit working, the voice to text just ignores prompts. The worst is the battery- I had a 4 year old Galaxy 5 that had a better battery life. Only reason I bought this was because my phone broke. Overall a bad purchase.
            "
"170","I bought this phone a month ago and it is not working anymore. The screen went black and has a blinking blue light on the corner.
            "
"171","I don't hate it. Just do love that I can do a lot on it. But tbat it is a referencephone and still has problems. I don't recommend this phone unless you want a fast dying phone that makes a terrible sound every time you use it and let's not forget that it over heats easily I have had it for about a month and I am not that satisfied
            "
"172","I love all the features of this phone and it has a great camera!
            "
"173","So far, the reconditioned Samsung is working as expected, just like new.  Very happy with it and all accessories we bought.
            "
"174","Bought for my teenager.... he loves it!
            "
"175","""no visible cosmetic imperfections when held 12 inches away"" is what the description reads.  There are several visible scratches on the screen.  It seems like a good phone so far but I feel that the description wasn't accurate.
            "
"176","Phone arrived in great condition. I can't tell that there's been any previous use. The headphones, and wall charger were still wrapped in plastic, and work perfectly.  The small metal tool to open the chip card slot was included too so I could put my own chip inside. My CDMA chip from RedPocketMobile works great in the phone. I look forward to getting used to a Samsung!
            "
"177","Purchase this phone last week,so far the performance of the product seems and operates as it is supposed to EXCEPT the battery only last 7 hours. Please let me know what to do. I do not wish to hear that I need to purchase a new battery as this product was advertised as RENEWED.
            "
"178","Phone appeared to have no issues at first, however after using it for two hours several issues became apparent-One, there is a crack in the glass next to the camera straight out of the box. It's small and hard to notice at first, but there is raised glass.Two, charging. Within those first two hours after having fully charged the phone it immedietly dropped to 56% charge and over the past two days has taken several hours (upwards of six) to charge more than 15% at a time.Three, constant restarts. In addition to the battery issues they are worsened by the fact the phone has been restarting constantly for the past two days and quickly drains the battery because of the obnoxiously long and bright Verizon screen. Because of the restarting using most if not all apps is all but impossible as anything you're doing can be lost at any time from calls, texts, games, to taking and saving pictures. Certain apps seem to prevent restarts for several hours for unknown reasons (usually games, such as pocket camp) While particular apps are open the phone usually won't randomly restart however this puts severe strain on the battery.Four- Hissing. Upon restarting, either as it is doing so or while rebooting the phone makes a hissing noise for half a second akin to something burning or an electrical static. Best guess is something to do with the battery connection or loose wiring, which I cannot fix without voiding the warranty.Five- Yesterday at work after taking off the charger the phone was stuck off for a total of twenty minutes and refused to turn on no matter what until it randomly reset.I would not of even taken a free phone that had this many issues, never mind paying over 200 dollars for one. I expected a fully working product to replace my old phone that finally broke after 4 years of use- this should have lasted more than four days before being virtually unusable.
            "
"179","Got the phone within 24 hours.  The charger did not work that came with it.  However, I had extras.  The phone was in great shape and had no issues getting it up and running.

"180","Refurbished junk
            "
"181","perfect,,,,,,,,, just like new.......
            "
"182","Says ""Verizon refurbished"" however we didn't even receive a Verizon phone. We received a at&t phone and Verizon said they are unable to put it under our plan.
            "
"183","Great refurbished phone - IF ONLY IT LASTED MORE THAN 4 months.
            "
"184","Very nice; just make sure to clear all background apps to prevent overheating while it's charging.
            "
"185","Bought this for my son. He has had it about 6 minutes, no problems. Looks like new.
            "
"186","Have only had this phone 5 months, and it just stopped working. Screen black and can't get it to turn on even using two different power cords in different outlets. Red light stays on at top. Have sent a note to seller to see what can be done, but this is my only phone and now I'm out of one! Should not have just died after only 5 months.
            "
"187","Bought this phone for my daughter. It stopped working after a few weeks. It would not charge. I tried many different outlets and chargers, but nothing worked. I am in the process of returning it.
            "
"188","I can honestly say that I was a little hesitant in buying a refurbished phone. I got the phone 3 days early and in excellent condition. Battery life is amazing! Much better than my old s6 on At&t. I have had absolutely zero problems with this phone so far. Well kept device.
            "
"189","This is a great phone
            "
"190","Battery crapoed out 1 day after warranty. Would not hold charge for more than 5 hours. Then the speakers started screeching randomly. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Ended up going to Verizon.
            "
"191","Phone died 2 weeks after purchase.  Screen went blank at 72% battery and could not take a charge. Never got it to turn back on so I sent it back for a refund. Return process was as expected.
            "
"192","Worked ok for about a month, then it stopped charging and wouldnt turn on. On the upside Product support was AMAZING and the return was simple. I did not get a full refund but I had cracked the screen but still felt my returned amount was fair.
            "
"193","Awesome phone and awesome service from seller.  Phone is in A1 condition.  Says refurbished but would swear its a brand new phone.  Love love love it.
            "
"194","Awesome phone, loses a star because there is no external memory slot.
            "
"195","I love my new phone! I was iffy about buying it from Amazon but I'm really shocked how week the phone works.  No scratches no lagging no nothing.  It was easy to transfer.... I'm with straight talk wireless and it's ready to switch over
            "
"196","Quality refurbish job phone operating like new.
            "
"197","phone kept freezing and ultimately stopped working altogether.  as a result, I was forced to purchase a new phone outright and wasted $172 on this phone which is now a brick.
            "
"198","Defective battery. Goes from 100% charge to 0% in less than an hour!!!!
            "
"199","works well  delivered in a timely manor
            "
"200","Good phone
            "
"201","Absolutely no problems with the Samsung S6 I ordered. I would definitely order from them again.
            "
"202","This phone barely worked. It would constantly just shut off and eventually just stopped working completely. Honestly a waste of time and money.
            "
"203","LOVE THE PHONE.  JUST  LIKE  NEW.  PRICE WAS GREAT AND I  GOT IT IN  JUST A FEW  DAYS  THANK  YOU
            "
"204","Works perfect, Very Happy with it., Thank you
            "
"205","My phone is just over a year old... has been maintained and abruptly stopped.  Took it to the Verizon store and they said there was nothing they could do for me.  For the money spent I am extremely disappointed. A dissatisfied customer
            "
"206","After 4 months the phone wouldn't hold a charge and the company was unable to help.
            "
"207","Phone just suddenly and completely died on day 112 after purchase.This was 22 days after after 90 day warranty expired.The ad says ""minimum 90 day"" warranty but I not able to return.Phone is now a brick.  Will not turn on.  My local repair shop said motherboard was fried??
            "
"208","The phone is pretty cool but very buggy and very annoying. It was working well for a bit before it kept randomly restarting and even after a factory reset it still does it and I'm not sure what's wrong with it. It has a few more bugs but I can't go into detail since it's just getting buggier.
            "
"209","Have had nothing but issues with this phone and nothing works as it should, the physical condition of this phone is good but the software and hardware inside are far from good and regrettable I had originally thought it was due to where I was staying for my job and by the time I got back hm it was too late for me to request a refund
            "
"210","In storage for 6 months ... 2 months into use, the screen goes wacky.
            "
"211","Me encanta  es muy buen aparato boy a pedir dos mas para regalarlos

"212","I LOOOOVE MY PHONE !!!! Came overnight before 12pm.
            "
"213","excellent!
            "
"214","Do NOT buy. Have had this phone less than a year and battery stinks. Just had 51% and it turned off and when I turned it back on said 0% and died. TERRIBLE.
            "
"215","Arrived looking almost new.  No issues after a month.
            "
"216","I've had this phone for about a month and everything has been running smoothly. I was suspicious about buying a phone on here and if it would work but setting it up was a breeze.
            "
"217","No problems so far! Looked perfect at the beginning, but at a closer look I could see some little scratches, so I wouldn't categorize it as a 'brand new product'.
            "
"218","Good
            "
"219","Bought this refurbished phone and was extremely disappointed. The phone had very visible scratches on the sides, the screen was literally loose on the top corners where it looked like it was gonna lift up, and front camera was extremely unclear due to fine fibers getting in the screen.
            "
"220","Love this phone it's easy to use and battery last a long time for me.
            "
"221","No issue works fine and I use it with Verison
            "
"222","Like the hr sensor next to the camera.
            "
"223","3rd one ive owned. A timeless phone in my opinion and you cant get much better at this ptice point.
            "
"224","I enjoy it
            "
"225","Love the phone except for the battery life.
            "
"226","Phone keeps over heating did it a couple times when I first got it but recently it's been happening more and more frequently. The phone gets so hot I have to shut it down.  Plus the battery dies super quick and I mostly just play around on Facebook or listen to music.
            "
"227","Excellent product! Phone arrived , with cable sooner than expected, looks brand new, no scratches,blemishes. I have had ZERO issues with this phone. Flawless. Great product !
            "
"228","Quit working the day after the return date. Incredibly disappointing and wrong.
            "
"229","really like this phone good sound and camera
            "
"230","working great so far
            "
"231","Good phone, but just remeber that the back is not meant to be removed. You can't add an extra SIM card for more memory, only the side port for a service activation card.
            "
"232","This phone keeps pushing the screen button over n over by its self while I'm trying to use it. Its very annoying  and I don't thing since I paid that much for the phone that its ok for it to already be messing up the day I received it
            "
"233","The charger plug has some issues, but I'm  wireless charging so its fine. Other than that Id think this thing was brand new. Very happy.
            "
"234","Great phone for a great price.  Can't even tell that it was used, so worth it to avoid the high price tag for new phones. I highly suggest going this route instead of buying a brand new phone up front. Saves a lot of money and still get a great phone.
            "
"235","<U+0001F601>
            "
"236","I was disappointed that this phone did not have a sd card slot , but that is on me. Great sound quality, Wi-Fi calling and cordless charging. I am quite happy with it.
            "
"237","Didn¡¯t say in the description that this is Verizon only & the phones locked. Verizon sucks & now I¡¯m paying for my current plan & have to go back to Verizon. <U+0001F644> not a fan of this at all. Battery sucks too.
            "
"238","Phone should not have passed the refurbishing process. It was overheating right out of the box. It has been constantly turning itself off and only soft resets are able to turn it back on.
            "
"239","Works wonderfully
            "
"240","great phone worked fine
            "
"241","As soon as I put my SIM card in, the phone went black. Shut down and powered up back to back continuously. Had to shut it down with the volume key. Very disappointing to wait for shipping all for a bad phone.
            "
"242","Excellent product exactly as described
            "
"243","Works great
            "
"244","The phone worked for one day. The battery malfunctioned and thought it was overheating and would not charge but the return process was super smooth. I am getting my replacement today so we will see how that phone works out.UPDATE: The replacement phone works like it's brand new without a scratch on it. If I had gotten this phone the first time. I'd give them five stars. They get four because the return, refund and replacement process was super simple and easy and more importantly it was fast.
            "
"245","Shipped fast. Phone works great! No issues setting it up.
            "
"246","too bad! I only use it 2 days and it no longer turns on, it is supposed that they are checked before being sold, it is better to pay a little more, this phone is garbage
            "
"247","Everything works and acts like a new phone. The only issue is the battery seems old.  It will just barely hold a charge for 8 hours of off-on regular use.
            "
"248","Bought this phone for my sister, she loves it. Everything worked perfectly
            "
"249","As expected ... Thank You
            "
"250","I am only giving a one star because you do not have the option to select none. This phone was awful. It screen jumped so badly that the only thing I could do was accept incoming calls.
            "
"251","I have had this phone for 6 months now. It only turns on when plugged in, and the battery meter doesn't work perfectly, but it does what I need it to do.
            "
"252","Purchased item in November. Less than 6 months later the speaker is not working.
            "
"253","Phone appears new and in great condition. However within a week of purchasing the phone the charger it comes with doesnt not work while the phone is on. Instead of battery percentage going up it goes down. The phone only charges when it off!!
            "
"254","The phone seems as good as new.  Great buy for the price!
            "
"255","Fantastic phone! It works beautifuly and was delivered right on schedual
            "
"256","I was so excited to get a replacement phone at such a low cost. Please don't buy this PHONE! The battery barely made it to lunch with hardly any use. I immediately felt like I wasted my money. I could have stuck with my old phone for the performance of this ""refurbished"" phone. Totally not worth the money!!!!
            "
"257","It¡¯s a good phone got it for my lil brother!
            "
"258","Item broke after 2 days screen went out and does not work.
            "
"259","My son was so disappointed.  The phone wouldn¡¯t charge.  My husband was upset that they would sell a defective product and charge us for return shipping.
            "
"260","Phone won't stay connected to our Wi-Fi, so is causing overages on our data plan.  Started doing this 3 months after we got it, so it's after the return window. Of course.  Not worth the risk...just get a new phone.
            "
"261","Love the phone, but the faceplate glass has an obvious bubble &/or imperfections in seal... contemplating return. I realize it is a refurbished phone, but something I've heard that repair places say is fixable? I will ask cs to see what they want to do?
            "
"262","It's been a few months since I purchased... I'm very happy with it!

"268","worked
            "
"269","It was a great choice of purchase. The phone works really well and I had it up and working with Verizon in less than 4 hours after getting it. It is in pristine shape for being refurbished. I am overall very happy with this purchase.
            "
"270","Total crap. They sell defects!  Will jot take video for longer than 3 seconds. Glitches every 3 seconds of use. Total crap. Seller should be banned!!
            "
"271","Stopped working after 2 weeks when I plugged it in before bed one night. Wouldn't even turn on the next day. They won't even respond to me to either exchange or get a refund either.
            "
"272","Should have returned it when I had the chance.  A soft reboot became necessary more often when screen freezing. 1st time out of 3 I've had trouble with a refurbished phone.
            "
"273","Received this phone in excellent condition although it  was refurbished overall great product for the price
            "
"274","I received the phone exactly when promised.  It came in great condition and works fabulously.  Thank you so much!!
            "
"275","Phone works great!
            "
"276","The charge port does not accept a charging cable because it is bent up the battery life is almost zero but then i did buy a cheap reused phone so partly my fault.
            "
"277","looks like new, i have the impression that the battery drains faster then my older Galaxy S6, not really a complain
            "
"278","The battery dies frequently And the charger port seems to be messed up. The charger always falls out of the charger port. I wish I had known about these issues before purchasing the phone
            "
"279","Good product
            "
"280","I feel like I'm on top of the world! It came as advertised and it was a day early!
            "
"281","Ordered phone and did not recognize my SIM. had to return the accessories at my own cost. That really upset me.
            "
"282","Oh perfect a Verizon phone that doesn't work on the Verizon network. Phone would not receive any signal bars. Half a day waisted trying to save a few bucks.
            "
"283","Phone was in great condition. Like new. Battery life not as good as I expected.
            "
"284","the phone bricked after a couple days but it was easy to get a speedy and full refund
            "
"285","I love it, but I wish the battery lasted a bit longer.
            "
"286","My 14 yr old really likes it. He is a typical 14 yr old so I didn't want to spend a ton. He is pleased in the phones ability to surf instagram and you tube and occasionally text his old man back
            "
"287","Had problems with a previous refurbished one but so far this one is perfect. Really happy :)
            "
"288","Phone does get hot pretty fast. I've had it now for about 5 months and haven't had any issues other than it getting hot. ( T-mobile pre-paid plan)
            "
"289","Phone works great, looks barely used. Would have gave 5 starts but One thing is that it did not come with the nano sim card holder that goes into the side. So I had to order a sim card holder so that I can use the phone for calling and mobil data.
            "
"290","The product had electronic defaults as the light was malfunctioning along with the charging port been defective as such the product was returned
            "
"291","When the camera is open it makes a weird static type of noise and the picture shakes even though the device is stationary. Amazon tech support was great and tried to help to ensure it wasn't software but it didn't resolve the issue, so it's just a defective device. This happened as soon as the camera app was opened right out of the box, so I think EMB-Phones doesn't know that ¡°A Certified Refurbished product has been tested and certified to work and look like new"" since they clearly didn't even open the camera. Would not recommend the seller. Also the device got SUPER hot, which I understand there's a lot going on inside while it's setting up but it was almost too hot to hold. Makes me think it wouldn't be able to handle video playback or other high demand functions without overheating.
            "
"292","I bought this phone two months ago, it's already dead, no matter how long I charge, the screen is completely black.  Will never buy a second handed phone ever again !
            "
"293","This phone is so amazing! Your paying an amazing price and your getting a Wonderful product! The camera is amazing and I only found a little scratch where you charge it but that is about it. I 100% recommend this phone
            "
"294","Worked ok but now it won't charge for me and they won't exchange phone
            "
"295","Phone looks new no scratches.  Works great.

            "
"299","I received this phone a month ago yesterday the screen got back out of the blue.I try to return it today I couldn¡¯t.It is not fair.
            "
"300","Did not work. I returned it. When I tried to insert the sim card, the space where it goes doesn't contains the proper equipment to hold the sim card, it's broken inside.
            "
"301","Biggest drawback to this phone was the retentless advertising that appeared when using almost all apps. The battery also seemed to wear out quickly. Otherwise good phone for the price.
            "
"302","This phone was refurbished horribly. After just a week or so of using it, it began to automatically hard restart or freeze, requiring a hard reset. It started slow, just once or twice a day, and soon it began to do that every time I used the phone. I tried to have it repaired, but it would cost more money than I was willing to pay. Unfortunately, my return deadline passed and so now I have a hunk of useless metal. I bought a refurbished S7 from another source and I've had 0 problems with it.
            "
"303","Great phone, and work perfectly!
            "
"304","Good phone... Battery in good shape (lasts about 20 hours between charges)... Works as expected. No complaints

            "

            "

            "
"343","There are a few glitches with the phone but it makes phone calls, it texts and no problems with taking pictures. This was better than buying a new phone, at-least at this point. I have had my new refurbished phone for a month or two.
            "
"344","Stopped working after 4 months
            "
"345","The battery life is the worst I have ever seen I charged the phone to full off and have not used it yet and left it on my bed with no WiFi or anything and the phone was dead when I got home from work.
            "
"346","Didn't work, would not recognize sim or stay powered on.  They told be to go to a repair shop
            "
"347","My phone did not come unlocked. I paid for AT&T and the phone only works for Verizon. Just wasted money.
            "
"348","The phone looks perfectly, but when I tried to insert the sim card, the space where it goes doesn't contains the proper equipment to hold the sim card, it's broken inside. I have pictures! So the phone doesn't work because if you insert the sim card it just dances inside...
            "
"349","I got my phone a few days ago and it works like a dream! But the only thing was the charger was acting funny so I had to use another.

            "

            "
"357","Great product came just as it said it would, if I ever need a new phone I'll buy it from these guys, by the way this is my legit opinion I'm not just saying this.
            "
"358","Features are all excellent, but battery life is much worse than I am used to.
            "
"359","It was bought for my son and he is happy with it

            "
"370","OK
            "
"371","So far, so good! I did have to get a new SIM card, only because the one from my old phone didn't fit. But that's certainly not the sellers fault. Also, very fast shipping!
            "
"372","Phone was better than my galaxy 5
            "
"373","Came smashed up
            "
"374","I must say that it arrived on time, I am very satisfied with the packaging and the delivery, it really looks in good condition, looks like new, but it has two serious problems, first after being using the camera for more than 1 minute, the phone reboots and the phone camera makes a weird sound using many apps and second it turns off when reaching around 20% battery, I thought it was a Software problem and I did a factory reset twice but the problem persists even after 4 factory resets.
            "

"397","Purchased this product 9 months ago...worked good at first, camera was a little foggy but I was just happy to finally have a ""working phone"" fast forward 8 months and my phone battery cant last for more than 4 hours. 9 months in and my phone randomly dies...I can have 50-70% battery and suddenly I'm at 0%. it wont answer phone calls, it dies if someone calls me. I contacted the seller they stated its after 90 days they cant help. I explained that I purchased a CERTIFIED REFURBISHED phone because they are supposed to last as long as a new phone, and function like a new phone...it you're looking for a refurbished phone that will last I do not recommend this seller! they make sure their phones are just good enough not ""like new"" or excellent condition to get them out the door and that's it...now I'm out 250 bucks and have to shell out more money for another phone!
            "
"398","I just bought this as a gift for my husband and it's great. We are upgrading his Samsung S4 and the process was really smooth except for one small hiccough, the SIM card on the new to us S6 is a nano SIM and in order to complete the transfer we had to go to the Verizon store to obtain a nano SIM.The new SIM was put in the phone by the rep at Verizon and after a brief delay,  the phone operates as anticipated.One of the downfalls of this phone is that there isn't a slot for an SD card, but with 64 GB, we're not worried about the storage.Given all things considered, I'd buy this one again.
            "
"399","I like how easy the was learn how to use.

"459","So a month ago I bought this phone and loved it! But one day it fell from my pocket and blacked out the screen :( but I loved the phone so I just bought another one. I charge it all night & turn it on the next day, put my sim card in it and all of a sudden it freezes and makes a loud screeching sound. Then the phone shut off and I haven't been able to turn it on since. Very disappointed since I liked the phone they sent me the first time. But why would you sell a phone that doesn't work? Isn't it suppose to be certified refurbished? I went 2 weeks without a phone, and when I got one I can't even use it because it doesn't work. So now I have to wait even longer to get a phone that does work. Very frustrating.
            "

"471","Fast shipping!  Device works good so far, only negative is the screen has some screen burn in which is probably why it is half the price of what you would pay in store.  Every function seems to work great so far.  Will keep you updated on battery life and other issues if I have any.  Can't beat the price though.

"551","I purchased this phone from Tech Venture. It arrived with a faulty processor. I took it into a shop that confirmed the processor was bad and that it would cost more to replace the processor than replacing the phone. I was in Costa Rica and could not ship the phone back to Tech Venture. Upon the completion of my trip I contacted Tech Venture who said that I was beyond my warranty period and they ""couldn't do anything to help me""A complete waist of money. Tech Venture does not stand behind their product.

"561","Phone didn't hold a call more than 2 mins. Phones looked perfect but was a complete piece of garbage. I'm guessing the antenna in the phone wasn't hooked up when they refurbished?  Either way junk.
            "
"562","First time with a refurbished, and I'm very happy with it.  Looks like new.  Only drawback is the quick battery usage. I downloaded the instruction manual from the internet.  I did noticed It charges faster in the car than when I charge with the brand new USB/a/c cable that came with it.
            "

"567","This phone is the wrong color and the condition is ""fair"" not ""good"" as advertised. There are scratch marks around the charge port. also this came with a sharkk charger and not a Samsung charger. the charger is poor at best. the phone loses battery power while charging if I use the phone while it is plugged in. to make matters worse the seller did not clear the previous owners data. there were several apps still installed on the phone that would not be there if they did a proper factory reset of the phone.
            "

"580","I am giving this a 3STAR rating- even though I returned the device. Out of the box it looked almost new, but the screen capture function would not work on the device. I use that function quite a bit and it became a nuisance for me. I think they should let you know if something about the phone could not be refurbished.
            "

"588","Its a really good phone i love it... only issue is because its refurbished it has slight issues.... i cant send picture messages through text..... my camera focus is blurry when i first launch the app, then i shake my phone, it focuses and functions just fine and my pictures come out really good

"591","Really is just like new! No issues with the battery or any of the wireless features. Phone didn't have any blemishes either that I could see. Was super easy to get activate by verizon. I bought this for my mom, and she can't stop talking about how much she loves this phone!
            "
"592","Third time was a charm. First refurbished had cracked lense cover. Second one from same vender was brand new but was wrong cell carrier. This one from a new highly rated vender looks and works perfectly. It has Android 7.0. This review was after 3 carefree days of use.
            "
"593","This phone came in great condition and good working order, it had a couple small dings on the casing (it now has more since I dropped it, whoops. Still works great though), but nothing obvious or beyond what you'd expect from a refurbished product. The phone works great and I like it a lot. The reason for a 4 star rating is that the battery life is not great. Even without heavy use I have to plug it in and charge it come the evening or else it will be in danger of having the battery die. That is my only complaint though. Good price for a good product.
            "
"594","ATT is my carrier. The unlocked phone was still pre-programmed with Verizon programs. ATT got the phone to function for calls with a new SIM card, however the voice mail and texting were a problem with AT&T due to the Verizon programming that ATT did not remove before they set up the phone.  I wasted time with several people at ATT before I found someone that knew how to solve the texting problem.  I got my voice mail to work via an internet chat after wasting a half hour with ATT and accomplishing nothing.This is probably more of an AT&T failure than the phone, but it is primarily due to the Verizon programming being imbedded
            "
"595","Im so glad I ordered this phone. I am paranoid with online purchases like this, but so glad I did
            "
"596","The phone is great except for the camera.  The rear facing camera does not focus on anything closer than several yards away.  This makes it impossible to use for most situations, and the seller has not responded to my messages over the last month.
            "
"597","Lost my 5 for a while this was a good replacement except you cannot replace the battery NO matter what they say....just need to use until it dies and the batter charge will not last the day other than that it worked great
            "
"598","For refurbished totally worth the price savings and works great. Only visible anomalies were at the charging port and it was just the shell that was scratched.
            "
"599","I am very satisfied with the phone. It looked brand new out of the packaging. I did experienced a problem with the lock screen. I was using a pattern to unlock the phone and suddenly the correct password was no longer accepted. I had to use my back-up to my PIN to unlock my phone and change the lock screen settings. I don't trust the pattern access anymore because too many incorrect attempts will wipe the phone of all information that is not backed-up.
            "
"600","It works for the most part. I keeps asking me to do a software updated every time I do one so after the 6th time every morning I postpone it for 24 hours. something that has just become part of my daily routine

"601","Phone was defective. Returned it.
            "
"602","This phone is a really nice phone. But I was really surprised that it made the trip to completely undamaged. When the package arrived everything that was inside was sliding around rapidly which was alarming and when opening it, just as I expected the phone and charger we're both loose and not supported by anything to keep it from getting damaged...
            "
"603","I would like my money back, I tried to activate the phone and it told me that I'm not able to because the phone isn't paid off.
            "
"604","Really good. I've been in need of an upgrade and this is exactly what I've needed, besides no warning that the phone takes a micro Sim card not your average card for the Galaxy S5 or S4. This product has been amazing.

"605","Charger did not work I had to use my
            "
"606","The phone was in very good condition with no scratches on the front glass. It will occasionally get stuck trying to connect to a wireless network and will require a restart to get it out of the stuck condition.

"607","Had to send it back in less than 5 days. The back button stuck and the phone kept clicking back. Couldn't stop it and therefore, couldn't see the phone

"609","Awesome phone.  Like new condition.  I'm very picky.  I'll never buy new again.  Not worth it.  Im beyond having to have the newest hottest thing every year
            "
"610","I bought this phone for my mother. Her phone was so outdated that it was no longer adequate. Being up in age she needed something easy to use . She simply loves her phone , even though it's not the latest and greatest it works well for her . I will definitely take advantage of this again on future purchases.
            "
"611","The cell phone is defective, it does not charge the battery, I would like to have my money refunded because I have to repair it in Argentina
            "
"612","This is my first time buying a refurbished phone. It is for work because I had lost my first company phone so replacing it was on me. Couldn't be more pleased. It came right on time, looks brand new, and works like it's brand new. I am thinking buying refurbished phones is now the way to go. I spent 1/4 the cost of the same phone new so as long as it doesn't break 3 times in a row over the course of me owning it it's totally worth it.
            "
"613","This was a refurbished phone.  Cosmetically it was like new but there was something wrong with the reception.  I had no bars showing as a signal strength where other phones in my house with the same carrier were showing 3 bars.  The signal strength was so weak it would make a call but drop it after a few seconds.  Also the battery must have been worn out.  it would last about 6 hours before it had to be recharged.  By refurbished  I had assumed the internal working parts of the phone would be checked and made as new, not just the appearance.  I returned it and bought a new phone from a different seller.

"614","Samsung Galaxy S6 (SM-G920V) - 32GB Verizon + GSM Smartphone - Black Sapphire (Certified Refurbished)So inserting a product link, since if you search for Galaxy S6 for Verizon and are looking at the refurbished ones, this one and the one linked are the top two. One of the sellers sells on both of them, and this one is slightly cheaper by about $20. I guess this is where they sell their duds.So first and foremost...this is not ""refurbished"" in the way you would expect. Lots of scratches. On the back, the camera lens, the home button, by the sim tray, and below near the charging port/speaker. I have no idea what the heck the last person did to this thing, but there are way too many scratches for anyone to sell this as ""certified refurbished"". Very used at best.Now I was thinking about this for a while and thought ""Maybe this is the standard with these guys.."". Then I got to the camera...Upon launching the camera I heard this incredibly obnoxious noise, from what I assume is the camera module on the back ""trying"" to focus, but apparently never does. I've never heard a phone make a noise this loud though from focusing. Something is very wrong with it. Almost every photo comes out blurry, because it never finishes focusing. Whoever did the repair on it or decided to pass the buck and thought ""hey..no one will everrrr take photos with this anyway."", should be reprimanded. Not cool.Anyway this is going back. I've bought used and refurbished stuff before, and that's usually not a problem. But for something costing several hundred dollars, they could have spent maybe more than 60 seconds trying out some basic functionality first.TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read): Phone itself is a great phone. The seller? Not so much. Don't but refurbished for this phone. Camera module is shoddy and makes a lot of noise and too many scratches. Try someone else.
            "
"615","Usually this is a great phone, however the camera on this phone places blue dots all over the picture.
            "
"616","I don't know if it was just thIs one phone that i received  but the battery life was horrible.  Walmart has the S5 for $200 and then I saw this S6 for the same price. it was refurbished and with Amazon's excellent return policy I decided to give it a shot. What a waste of time and  what a headache. I should have just gone with the S5 at Walmart and eventually I did. so I had this phone for a couple weeks and the battery life was just absolutely garbage. the phone works great and all but what good is it if it doesn't last a full day.  on more than one occasion after being at work for 3 hours I would check my phone and  the battery would already be dead. after I already decided that I would return it, I ended up purchasing the S5 at Walmart. So I had both phones And wanted to test how bad the battery life was on the S6. I fully charged it to 100% overnight then unplugged it and just left it on and alone before I went to work. without using it or touching it, by the time I got home the battery life was down to 20%, no exaggeration.  I think this problem is with the S6 model in general. Walmart doesn't even carry an S6 model. They have S5 S7 S8. I think there's a reason for that.

One concern is when I move icons from one page to the other it sticks. It will not budge and I have to be patient for it to catch or try again and again. Anyway, so far so good for a refurb phone.

Second, the only way you can hear the other caller clearly, is if you had the client on speaker phone. Second, the phone did not have a Verizon SIM card, so I had to request one issued immediately. Third, there was no Voice Mail playback app check, without having to call your voice mail from your phone. And finally, the battery lasted about 3 hours, with continued use.  I hated this phone!

"652","I'm extremely happy with my purchase of a certified refurbished Samsung Galaxy S6 from MyWit. I was nervous about the purchase due to the negative reviews but the reviews must be for a different seller for this model phone.I'm happy to say my experience was great. The phone is in EXCELLENT condition without a scratch on it! There was an OEM fast charge wall adapter and cable in the box with the phone.The phone I received is a Verizon phone however I was able to use it for Tracfone since they use Verizon towers. I purchased a 4G Tracfone SIM card kit from Amazon for $1.This phone takes a nano SIM card. The door for the SIM card is on the right side of the phone, under the power button. I had to use a small paper clip to insert in the hole to open the door for the SIM card (the small tool was not included in the box).The phone had 60% charge when I received it so I was able to turn it on to get the IMEID number to turn on service with Tracfone on their website. Setup was fast, easy, and I was able to transfer my existing phone number to this phone. The whole process took about 10 mins on their website. I was able to use my new phone right away.How to find the IMEID number: turn on the phone, go to settings, about phone, status, then scroll down to IMEID.I would highly recommend purchasing from seller MyWit.

"661","This is my first time buying a refurb phone.  Now I know why the price is low...risk!  I realize the deal now, so let my experience inform your decision.  I bought the phone and immediately applied a screen protector.  Error number 1.  Make sure you put the phone through its paces before sinking money in a screen protector because if later you find a problem, a bad earphone jack in this case, you are out the money.  Also I'll be without a phone while I order another.  I've got to repackage and ship, which will cost me money.  The thing that really gives me heartburn is setting up a new phone.  Time is money.  So I may be contemplating error number 2...giving a refurb another try!  Hope springs eternal.

Phone came bent a little the employee said. It also will not turn on. Turns on to show boot up screen, black, boot up screen again, off. I have factory reset this phone 6 times in 1 day. Finally got to see the home screen so I got happy to see if I made a breakthrough. Whomp, the phone freezes and makes this horrifying noise. Restart it again. I mean come on, really? I want to use this phone but I don't know why it's doing this. Please help me.

"668","Phone works well. However, it was advertised on the Amazon site as new when it is not.

"669","The phone kept freezing and turning off when the battery was charged enough that it shouldn't have been doing that. When it would try to turn back on it couldn't and kept restarting over and over until it froze. At one point I had to reboot it 7 times to get it to turn back on. It would also shut down in the middle of calls, and start the process of restarting over and over and then freezing.

"690","I took a chance by buying a refurbished phone. I was expecting to see some wear from previous use, but the phone looked mint. I couldn't be more satisfied with the purchase. Battery was a concern, and after customizing the settings to how I need them, it's a lot better than I would have expected based on the reviews of a new S6. I haven't come across a single issue.

"697","My phone arrived in good condition and I really like this phone.  Activating this phone through Verizon was quick & easy.  The phone was missing a sim card, but a new sim card was only 5 bucks.  The only hassle was that the phone kept giving me sound notifications that were a distraction.  I couldn't even have a phone conversation without the sound notifications continually being a distraction.  I finally resolved the problem by going into SETTINGS & muting the sound notifications.  The phone now works great.  Definitely worth the money and I no longer have to pay monthly installments to Verizon on a new phone.

"706","Slightly too large for my hand, the phone also has some odd buttons compared to my Moto X. On the other hand, the phone is responsive, and despite fears, battery life is quite good, and available wireless charging means I don't have to fear destroying the charge port. The wide availability of accessories (even in dollar stores!) makes the phone a good deal without paying like $800 for an S8.  Activation was minimal... just put in my nanoSIM from my old phone, then activate phone with my Google account, and it's done. All in all, good phone for the price.
            "
"707","Design:  The Samsung Galaxy S6 is a great phone for any user.  The size is great for individuals who view or edit media on their phone, while still fitting great in a pants pocket or purse.  The sturdy metal body makes for a tough phone that can withstand moderate, accidental drops.  A change from the S5 design would be a permanent back cover, taking away access to the phone battery. A side slot was implemented for access to the SIM card, which was previously under the back cover.  The speaker, headphone jack, and charging port are all conveniently located on the bottom of the phone.Display: The S6 has a 5.10 inch touchscreen, with 1440 by 2560 pixels, making for a clear and easily viewable image.  Screen brightness can be adjusted to your liking depending on your surroundings.  This may increase your experience while doing things from watching a movie to making a simple phone call.Camera: This phone has a front facing and rear facing camera, with a flash located next to the rear facing camera.  The front camera is 5-megapixels while the rear camera is 16-megapixels, making for a tremendously clear image.  If Samsung were to only have one thing figured out, it would be their camera quality.Storage: Storage on my S6 is 32 GB of internal storage.  There is no expandable storage with the S6, which is something the older styles and new styles do have.  With a 3 GB RAM, you can have many applications running, which allows you to go between them without waiting for each one to reopen and losing your progress.  Storage settings also allow you to clear unnecessary files to free up storage and optimize performance. This also helps battery life, which this phone has. You know, 32 GB can hold a large amount of media.Connectivity: The number of connection types the S6 has is very large.  Being a phone, it obviously supports calling/messaging plans along with data plans for 3G or 4G/LTE.  Another internet connection it supports is Wi-Fi, where either can help navigate GPS.  Mentioned before, this phone has a headphone jack, along with Bluetooth which can connect without the use of internet. One cool feature this phone has is infrared connection, allowing you to use your phone as a television remote.This phone has many advanced settings for an individual looking to use them, but it can also be used as a simple phone for someone uninterested in them.  This makes it very user friendly.
            "
"708","Just want to chime in and say I took a risk on this phone and I absolutely love the decision. Upgraded from an apple iphone 5c, and although the s6 is a couple years old now, to me the display is AMAZING. What a significant upgrade from my previous phone. I use square a lot so I've been noticing that customers also have a lot easier time looking at the screen as well. I've been using my phone for virtual reality a lot, and it looks great. Heats up a little bit, but still great for a starter mobile VR setup . Kinda wish I got the 128 GB version, but the 64gb has been working out fine. I've installed a LOT of virtual reality apps, pretty much everything I could, and with some other apps like facebook snapchat,  etc I still have 20gb free, which I'll probably just use for taking videos.Anyway, the display is beautiful, I love how it syncs with my windows PC. I thought it'd be difficult to switch from ios to android, but it was actually very easy. Take a chance on this phone! Pretty sure amazon offers a 90 day warranty anyway so make sure you get a phone you're satisfied with

"711","Ever since the last update the battery drain is horrible. Verizon has sent several replacements which have also been junk. The most recent one, wouldn't even allow me to exchange the sim card. Samsung's quality has gone way down ever since they had issues with phone batteries and washing machines.Verizon did offer me the Galaxy S8 because of all the issues but I chose to stay with the S6 because all the phones with the edge screen crack so easily.
            "
"712","From the beginning, my Galaxy S6 battery would go from 100% to 85% to 45% to 15% to 5% within just hours of light use. I called Samsung to report the issue and customer service admitted a defect in some batteries, but they refused to repair the issue without an outrageous charge -- and having to send the phone to their repair shop in Texas for a week or more. I have owned the Sumsung S3, S4, S5, and now S6... and I can assure you this will be my last Samsung phone ever.

"745","So far the Phone works as expected because i had a spare part. Two notable product discrepancies, one would have been a show stopper had it not been for me having a prior dead G6.1) the Sim card tray, was missing. The sim card itself is expected to be missing (verizon provides that), but the G6 has a holder specific to the G6 that is a part of the phone chassis, which is used to hold the Sim card. the phone arrived and this piece was missing. had i NOT had my old G6 (with a cracked screen), this phone would have been useless, as you cant put the sim card in w/o the G6 tray2) ""relevant accessories"" was not like for like w/ a new G6. Specifically, the charger is not a G6 stock shipping charger, which is functionally important, as the G6 supports fast charging, the stock charger supports fast charging. the adapter provided is an older samsung adapter which does NOT support fast charging.So far the phone meets my needs (although i am dismayed about the charger), but it only meets my needs because i had an old broken G6 i could pilfer for a G6 carrier card for SIM.
            "

"748","When my old S6 suffered a fatal drop I was looking at getting a new Samsung and discovered they are all gigantic, not to mention expensive. I bought this and will make up what I would have paid with a contract in 5 months. All I had to do is move my SD card, I didn't even get an activation fee. I love the S6, it is such a great all around phone. The refurbished looked and felt brand new. The battery life is maybe not as long as with a \new phone but better then my 2 year old phone was. Overall I'm very happy I decided to purchase.
            "
"749","Beautiful job with refurbishment, can barely tell it isn't brand new.The S6 is fast, convenient, and thankfully doesn't require the bizarrely specialized cord that the S5 did. Unfortunately Samsung just wasn't done experimenting yet and this thing lacks an SD card slot, which is annoying, but the larger hard drive and OTG compatibility make up some of the difference.A very easy to use phone. Gets good signal, the bluetooth pairs flawlessly, a staple for keeping in touch with my parents in Egypt.
            "
"750","I bought this phone to replace my Galaxy S5 that I had for four years and recently dropped and broke.  This phone looks identical to my S5 and is the same size.  The only thing I really don't like about it is that the battery drains very quickly if you play any kind of games on it....and I don't play games all day either.  My S5 battery held up very well but this one drains within an hour!!  I am having to carry two additional external pocket juices with me everywhere I go to insure, I always have power.  Another thing is that the battery in this phone is built in and cannot be removed or replaced.  Another negative about this phone is that I am having dropped calls where I never experienced dropped calls with my S5.  Also, when I am at work, I've noticed that the internet connection drops and has a hard time reconnecting.....another problem that I never had with my S5. All in all.....if I had to do it over, I would have ordered a different model phone OR gone back to the S5 model that I was very happy with.

"751","Was very cautious at first, I've never bought a phone online before let alone a refurbished one. It came with the factory pvc screen protector and the factory charger box amd cable. The switch from my old phone (Galaxy 5s) was seamless! I'm enjoying all the wonderful new features and the phone works like its brand new. Only thing is it didn't come with the SIM card key, I used a needle stuck to the end of a pencil eraser to open it. Not a big deal at all though. Even though I was cautious, it helped knowing that if it came damaged, there is the 30 day guarantee. Overall very satisfied! I recomend this seller and will consider them in the future when I need a new phone.
            "
"752","Exceptional quality for a refurbished phone. No scratches, dents or blemishes of any kind.  Bought this for a 8 year old who was using a Samsung J7. He is very happy.The only things I would list as a con is that the phone didn't ship with headphones or a fast charger.  The headphones is not a big deal, but should have at least shipped with a fast charger.Update 3-21-19: The battery has started dying faster than it should and sometimes does not recognize that it is plugged in. Contacted customer service, but no help since 3-20-19 was 4 days past the warranty expiration  date.  I no longer recommend this item or the seller.

"753","The only thing I liked the appearance the charger didn't fit had to buy another only to find out the charging port was messed up then bought a wireless charger making sure it was compatible for that phone then the digitized went out so phone was completely useless will never buy anything from here again spent over $200 now no phone and money gone

"755","This review is more for the specific phone we received and not the S6 phone in general.  We had some issues with the phone upon start up and you could see the scratches from the refurbishing in areas such as around the camera aperture.  We couldn't take the risk paying money for a questionable phone. We had zero problems with the seller however.
            "
"756","One frustration, it doesn't include a sim card which would have been helpful to know. I don't replace phones often so wasn't aware it was required and wasn't included. I found out after purchasing a sim card, Verizon gives you a sim card for free if you have an account with them. I know we try to reduce costs but even the above info would have been extremely helpful to me and many companies that deal with this all the time don't think of the little things to alleviate customer frustration. One other thing to note, the customer service for this company isn't available on the weekends. Other than the initial frustration the phone works well for me.
            "
"757","I bought this phone for my mom for Christmas. About six months later it stopped charging. I contacted this company to see about either a replacement or even just some sort of partial refund or credit towards a new phone. They said they only offer 30 days and after that nothing. I paid over $200 for a phone that only lasted six months. That is a scam in my book!!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!!

"759","The photos are excellent and the phone is extremely responsive. The only downside is it doesn't have expandable memory, which isn't critical since I listen to music, etc with my ipod anyways.

"760","It's not the phone I don't like -- it's Dealfisher. The phone does not work correctly and dealfisher never has replied to my contacting them. It does not hold the charge properly -- constantly requires re-charging, Most importantly, the phone does not find a WIFI signal when not at home so it's become dangerous as I have found myself reliant on a machine for appts and directions I cannot get....despite Verizon Wireless testing everything about the signal...it appears it is the phone at fault in these repeated cases.I find myself at home and other locations without a signal and it has resulted in my paying significantly in roaming-related charges when I am not roaming,. All in all, Dealfisher has proven it does not stand by its sales as it never returned my calls to investigate the phone's repair and I did not unfortunately activate the phone within the 30-day window due to odd circumstances so Amazon will not get involved....which Dealfisher apparently recognizes. They've lost all my future business. -- Kim

I am using battery saving mode, and it has helped to extend the life of the phone's battery. I charge it overnight and am good all day unless I have a day of particularly heavy usage.
            "
"762","Excellent condition. Good quality and value for money.
            "
"763","Bought this to replace my dying Galaxy S4 and didn't want to spend 500 or more on a brand new phone. I am pleasantly impressed at the refurbished quality. Buying anything used or refurbished can go good or bad especially online when you can't see what you're buying other than the generic pictures Amazon uses, but the phone I received looks and is working like new so far. I got my my phone from The Red Cell Certified seems like they do good refurbish work would recommend them.
            "
"764","The phone works great, just as described.  It was truly unlocked and hooked up with Tracfone without any issues.  Battery life on the S6 isn't the greatest.  Otherwise so far I am happy with the phone.  One issue with Deal Fisher though, we requested and paid for 2 day shipping, but they sent it out 3 day....which turns into 4 when you live in the country.
            "
"765","When I make a call, I need to turn the speaker phone in order to hear the person I'm talking to. You have to go into the phone icon to see if there is a voicemail, and you have to go back through phone history to find a past voicemail to get into voicemail. Voicemails don't show up right away. The connections for charging and headphone/stylus are on the bottom. So when I put it in my pocket, I have to put it in upside down so the stylus stays  attached.
            "
"766","This phone is fine if you are looking for a temporary replacement.  The battery life on the model I got lasts about 5-6 hours of moderate use before it needs to be charged.  I generally have to charge it around lunch time and it's nearly dead again by bed time.  The do not disturb feature also does not work correctly.  Other than that I've had an S6 before and they're great and very user friendly, but the autocorrect is a mess.
            "
"767","The first one of these (refurbished) Samsungs I ordered could not be activated.  Something was wrong with the set-up chip.The second one is great--everything works well, and, since I am a novice, and elderly, I don't feel as though I paid for bells and whistles I will never use.I started with a Galaxy and so I enjoyed the shorter learning curve.In sum, except for the initial inconvenience, I'm glad I went with a used phone.
            "
"768","although the phone's body was in a good condition, I can not hear or be heard during a call
            "
"769","The phone is excessively hot and when I reactivated it at the Verizon store, they said that it's not normal and should be watched. Reading the reviews of the previous purchasers, I am concerned that this is rampant issues with this phone and company. I will be seeking a refund and/or replacement that works.
            "
"770","I love the phone, had the galaxy J7 Property,and liked it but wanted more power. First thing first, extremely happy with the new phone like the speed, finger print identity  etc.etc. The cons smaller screen than the J7 and the BATTERY sucks!! I have been on phone for 45 minutes started with full charge,  and now it's at 42%. Not good. <U+0001F632><U+0001F632>
            "
"771","The microphone didn't work and the screen rotate function was all over the place.Appearance wise it looked brand new but those are some major issues that could have been  tested easily.Also it took longer to ship than stated and I will have to remain phoneless until I receive a refund. Not worth the hassel. The Amazon seller was SikkSound.
            "
"772","I was a little skeptical at first purchasing a certified refurbished phone rather than brand new from a carrier, but am so glad I did! I can't even tell the difference, it looks and performs like a brand new phone. I've had it for almost 2 months now and have had no problems or glitches. It shipped really fast and came with a generic charger, and screen protectors on the front and back sides. Ive kept the protectors on and they haven't bubbled up or anything. It was a little difficult to remove it from both cameras though. Overall very happy and will go this route from now on when upgrading my phone!
            "
"773","It came damaged, I had to return. I needed a new phone asap so I was not able to wait for a new one and had to purchase a phone from a local store.Before it noticed the damage I was able to set up and used the phone just fine for the couple of hours I had it so no complaints there. But because of my circumstance I cant attest to the battery life or the longevity of the phone.The return was easy.
            "
"774","This phone has been a nightmare. Haven¡¯t had it a month and the screen went completely black. Can¡¯t bring any data over onto my computer. And lost so much information! I cannot even right now. Do not ever buy refurbished, clearly. Spend the extra $100 and get a new one.I¡¯m going to send it back and put the money towards a new phone.
            "
"775","The phone itself is great. The refurbish process appears to just be a factory reset as the case was pretty rough with scuffs and a small crack in the case (screen is great). I wasn't expecting perfect, so not the end of the world, but if you are probably shouldn't go with a refurbished device.
            "
"776","I should have researched the S6 better before I bought it. The battery - just 6 months in - is hopeless. With my previous phone (a Galaxy 4), I just bought a new battery, installed it, problem solved. But you cannot easily replace the S6 battery. It has rendered this phone a waste of money.
            "
"777","The ""like new"" refurbished phone we recieved had a total fully charged battery life of around 3 hours with use. Garbage. Returned for refund. Also, came with an off brand charger, no manual, and a small crack/chip on the front of the phone.
            "
"778","The phone is in excellent condition.It's kind of creepy when it still remember the last owner email in its auto fill keyboard.The camera create weird noise and shaking by itselft in 15 second then get the focus. It's finally get focus right away after few weeks using it.
            "
"779","i have had this phone for about 3 months now, it has worked perfect.  It was pretty easy to switch the sims card and transfer all my data over.  I did have to google how to do it, but it was easy.  I am very happy with the phone, battery last a long time.  I was nervous about the purchase because I have never purchased a phone from a non Verizon dealer, but so happy I did.
            "
"780","Only had it for a few days but I like it so far. It¡¯s getting use to a new phone. I really like it better than my old one because the old phone stopped working. It has a fantastic camera and screen. I will know more after a few days of use.
            "
"781","Phone is great in every way except the battery stinks. I can't even go half a day without it going dead. That's with no apps running in background.
            "
"782","I've had this phone for 2 months now and it is working beautifully. Was a little leery of buying refurbished, but I've had no problems with it at all. The Verizon Store was great cloning my old sim card for the new phone for no charge. The customer rep walked me through a few new features I was unaware of and I was up and running in no time.
            "
"783","Have not had an issue with operation of device, great first phone for my 12 year old. Battery doesn't seem to last as long as my and my wife's previous S6 but this phone is 3 years old. I just don't think the refurbishment included a new battery.Would definitely buy another!
            "
"784","We are returning this phone, already ordered a replacement one but this one when you take a picture it makes the shutter noise and then keeps making it, the picture freezes and then jumps...according to google search it has some sort of  short in the phone but we are trying again
            "
"785","Having used a flip phone, (I worked in a very caustic environment for phones) I suffered sticker shock when looking at the S9.  This is a great alternative as it gives all the features I need on a smart phone for a fraction of the price.  Works great.
            "
"786","I love anything made by Samsung. Every one of these phones are good phone
            "
"787","Works just fine, but the issue is that there's a symbol burned into the screen that I noticed when I first turned it on. It still works perfectly and I got all my information moved over, so I don't want to get another one. So props to it working fine, but to the people wanting to buy top condition phones, maybe find another one. If you're just looking for a regular smart phone, this works well. Aside from the refurbishers not doing a perfect job, my only complaint is the battery on the samsung 6. Without the power saver on, this phone seems to deplete its battery insanely fast.
            "
"788","Frequently shut off and reboot. Waiting to see if it continues.  Have some time to decide on returning.Update: it's being returned. It is now making some type if rotating noise and will not shut off.
            "
"789","This Samsung Galaxy S6 arrived promptly & in what looked to be fairly new condition. There were some bugs involving the latest OS update wanting to update again & again & again...you get the idea. I received a notice daily & kept hitting ""Update Later."" Recently I decided to see if I could get it to download properly & it finally has accepted it. I'm hopeful the phone will continue working properly & I can use it for years to come.
            "
"790","Great phone, great features lightening fast on Verizon network....***word of advise if your on another network other than VERIZON even though the phone is unlocked You may only be on a 3G LTE***

"791","Came with the wrong battery charger, and didn't have the pin to open the slot for the SIM card. A bit scratched, and doesn't have the option to put in a SD card.
            "
"792","I had high hopes. In my mind ""certified refurbished"" meant restored to like new condition. Uh no. This phone won't charge properly, it won't hold a charge for very long at all, the finger print sensor doesn't work at all. This is so frustrating. I really thought I was doing the smart thing buying used and saving a buck no. I am printing out my return label and sending this nonsense back tomorrow.
            "
"793","Actually  delivered ahead of schedule which was huge for me. I bought this as a backup phone for my Droid Turbo Plus. The Droid was down so much the refurbished  Samsung is now my only phone.
            "
"794","Love it actually. The only reason I gave 4 stars is I have had the phone about one week and the screen freezes. Never had this problem before but  this is the first time I purchased a refurbished phone too. But I do love the phone!!!
            "
"795","This phone was in great aesthetic conditions, two bad things though and worst part is that it had something jammed in the headphone jack and also it is NOT unlocked fully for any carrier like the description says. It tells you how to set your current carrier up but to not great lengths. So returning it for sure.
            "
"796","Needed an upgrade from my S5. Am disappointed in the lack of memory card slot, but I knew that about the model before I bought it. Works great otherwise. Just note, if you're upgrading from an older Galaxy S-series phone, that this one switched a smaller SIM card, meaning you can't just change the SIM over from your old phone.
            "
"797","Phone works well, camera does not.
            "
"798","The phone looks and works like brand new I am extremely happy with my purchase.

"799","Phone is in perfect condition. Just like new. Battery life is great. Speaker and microphone have great sound. It¡¯s hard to believe that this is a refurbished phone. I wish I was able to give more than 5 stars. Would give 10.
            "
"800","I thought this phone was good at first. It worked great for the first month. Battery life got worse and worse. Then today the phone randomly did a master reset and deleted everything! All my pictures gone. I will never buy a refurbished phone again. Especially off Amazon.
            "
"801","Bought this phone as a replacement for my cracked S4. I love my S6, but wish I would have known  that this model does not have a spot for an SD card.  However,  I have not run out of space yet.
            "
"802","Very Good Purchase for a refurb. very happy with the phone. added a sim card and it went right onto our plan with no problem!!
            "
"803","Never know it was a used phone except it needed a LOT of updates. The phone itself looks new and works as it should. I'd give it 5 stars if I didn't develop gray hair updating it. Took a while.....
            "
"804","No problems whatsoever with this phone.  The camera on my LG was better, but thus phone is more responsive.
            "
"805","these refurbished phones have a short life battery, I rather buy a new one. PLEASE don't waste your money. I used this phone for 3 hrs straight and the battery was down to 25%.

"806","Works well no problems
            "
"807","the camera doesn't work on the galaxy S6 that was sent to me. It won't focus and just stays blurry. Really frustrating for someone who takes a lot of pictures. Hopefully they will replace it with one what does work properly.
            "
"808","Bought this phone for my son and within a week it started having problems! So amazon was amazing and sent me another one and I sent the old one back and the same thing happened to this one too! Will never own a Samsung phone again!

"809","Product works great, looks like a new phone. Have not had any issues with it. Love how it looks.

"810","Love the color and phone works good as well. A good purchase and arrived in time for the holidays.
            "
"811","I received my refurbished phone very timely and was very satisfied with the seller. The camera function has a slight stutter when activated but I've heard that it happens with brand new samsung phones also. I would have sent it back for a replacement but I went into labor and was with my daughter in the NICU for the following 2 months. I will definitely be using this seller again
            "
"812","Great phone!
            "
"813","It is a nice phone. I think I was just used to the bigger face on my old phone. But beside it being smaller it is everything I expected it to be.
            "
"814","This is my first phone. I did like the idea of an iPhone, but they're way too expensive. So far, after having this for a little over a month, I am extremely pleased with my Samsung. It charges quickly (a downside is that the battery goes down more quickly than I'd like) and the Chrome browser is as fast on the phone as it is on my laptop. In fact, I really like how the phone comes set up with Chrome, as well as Amazon apps.I absolutely love reading books on the Kindle App! On my breaks at work I can pull my phone out and get in some good reading; it's much more enjoyable than holding my large and heavy Ipad for reading.One of the neat things about this phone is that you can set different ringtones for different contacts. Being a Lord of the Rings fan I set my default ringtones to Gandalf shouting, 'You shall not pass!' Then I set all my contacts to the Shire music ringtone. So now, whenever someone calls who isn't on my contacts list, I have the pleasure of hearing Gandalf telling them they shall not pass. LOLI also really like the Samsung Health app that comes pre-installed; it's very helpful to see how many steps I take per day. You can set a target amount of steps as well. In the job I do, I usually get over my target of 10,000 steps (though it's not strenuous walking by any means, and isn't continuous). It's nice to know that I am at least getting in a fair amount of physical activity.I do have one complaint, which is that I set up an audiobook playlist on the Music app. If I pause the audiobook and then put the phone to sleep, it won't save my place within the track. I may be able to find a workaround in the settings, but it's a bit annoying to have to find my place again by fast-forwarding through the track. I'm sure this isn't as much of an issue if you're just listening to music, though.For the price, this phone really can't be beat. It's sleek, elegant, and just the right size to fit into your hand. I've had fun playing around with it and figuring everything out.The camera is also pretty nice.

"816","I loved the phone when I got it. But after about 3 days of having it the battery died so I put it on to charge when I turned it on the screen went black. So I sent it back.

"822","So far so good, hopefully it doesn't die in four months.  High priced for a used phone.  Cheaper than paying $600+ for something that is lucky last two years.

"823","Phone works great.  The charger on the other hands sucks.  Not the cable but the plug does not work.  Cable is good.  Using on a slow plug.  I liked your plug when it first arrived as it charged fast.

"894","Product claimed to be unlocked but was not at all.
            "
"895","Very easy to load and use.  Down fall is that the Galaxy S6 does not allow you to use a SD card.  Otherwise price and phone great
            "
"896","Very good phone for the money.  I feel as if I got such a great deal.
            "
"897","I am still learning to use it, but I am pleased with my Samsung 6.
            "
"898","This product arrived on time and looked fine. It even worked fine for about one hour. Then it began rebooting on its own over and over again. The phone finally reached a state where it would not even boot. I called the customer support (apparently a company called MyWit handles the refurbishing and support) to see what they could do. The lady was nice enough, but basically told me that if I wanted a replacement phone I'd have to return the defective one and reorder a new one. There was no chance they could rush me a new one, nor was there any attempt to help in any other way. Apparently their rigorous quality check process at MyWit isn't all that rigorous. If you buy this, you are taking a risk.

            "
"907","a few weeks after I began using it, it lost the Bluetooth. Blue tooth will come on for a short time every once in a while. However it does not stay on long enough to complete a call. All other features work.

"908","Super clean. No issues.

            "
"913","Nice phone. Looks brand new and so far has worked flawlessly.
            "
"914","I have had this phone for a few months now, so I can give a review based on time, At first I thought the battery was not lasting like it should, but I believe it was the building. I can go over 24 hours without charging and still have battery life. Certain apps do drain it. If I had a complaint, it is, after texting, I put the phone in a pocket and accidently dial people because the phone icon is in upper corner. This occurred several times before I realized why I was doing it. Simple solution is to hit side power button before putting it in my pocket. I am not too tech savvy so there is probably a lot more I can do with this phone but pictures are great and sound is great. Seems to have a quick response time and overall am happy with this refurbished phone!
            "
"915","PERFECT
            "
"916","Battery sucks juice and the camera screen has blue dots and leaves blue dots on my pictures. Not worth what I paid! :(  but I can make calls and send text

"918","Had to send back to (Breeds) because it was defected. It's been almost 3 weeks and haven't heard anything from the company.  Disappointed customer.
            "
"919","Do not buy it. Mine was a pice of garbage I get a blank screen while charging it (only way to restore it is making a soft reset). It restarts itself while talking to someone and out of nothing cell blocks itself, becomes very hot and drains the battery (and again only way to stoping it is whit a soft reset).
            "
"920","Good phone battery sucks
            "

"953","EXELENTE
            "
"954","Do not buy from EMB-PHONES. They say their phones are excellent they are not. I received a defective phone, and the battery got very hot. Post office told me I can not send it back unless the battery is taken out. The phone screen is blank, and most likely their going to resell it.

            "
"971","these were terrible from the git-go!!  shipping box had no filler and phones were rattling around , cant believe they made it in one piece!  upon opening they looked good but ,,, neither would charge well and both charging ports were loose and wouldn't plug in correctly!! they were actually worse than the 5 year old phones we bought these to replace!!!!! the ONLY reason they didn't Immediately go back was when we took to our provider to have them transfer #s and info , they signed us up for a special phone insurance offer with amnesty,, so we sent these awful things in and got new phones!!  do not do business with these guys! all they seem to do is clean up old phones, put in a new box , and ship to you saying its rebuilt..
            "

"975","Good enough! !
            "
"976","Came in a generic box, generic charger. No original Samsung book. It works fine except for when it is OVERHEATING AND SHUTTING DOWN. I have emailed the seller several times with no response. Would have liked an exchange but now am attempting to return it. I am nervous about sending it back and just continuing to get no response. Then I will be without my money and a functional phone. Awesome. Worst part is, I bought an accident protection plan. We will see if that is refundable, but that's probably money we will never see again.
            "
"977","Excellent condition.
            "
"978","Just like any new phone you get its a learning curve and then you're upset....Yup there is NO SD card slot... in fact you can't even take the back off. But it has Samsung VR which is pretty cool. And wireless charging is built-in, no need for sloppy 3rd party gizmo for it to work.It's thinner and it's the first phone that the back is flat.. no curve or bump.The screen size isn't much bigger then the S5 so don't expect much.Overall it's a pretty good phone.
            "
"979","When a phone is refurbished a new battery is installed. NOT in this case. Don't trust it!
            "

            "
"983","For the most part all of the phone was perfect(: ran smoothly and very great condition.Only thing wrong with it is the ""selfie"" camera mode has small random purple dots. Not very noticeable unless you take a photo of your face. But I'll be giving this phone to my bf anyways who doesn't take much selfies. Lol.
            "

"986","Awesome phone
            "
"987","two days after the end of the very short warranty period the phone will no longer charge.  Buy from these people at your own risk.
            "
"988","I just received the phone yesterday and everything is so far so good! It is basically new! The only reason why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because i received a NEXUS charger instead of the samsung charger. I also did not receive anything to use to open up the sim card holder (luckly i  found one). I messaged the seller about the charger issue and hope that they will give me the correct charger. Waiting for a response.Also works great with straighttalk
            "
"989","Just as presented, very happy!
            "
"990","Just like new! No problems whatsoever!
            "
"991","While the phone is in very good condition overall, the only thing wrong with it is the back camera. It makes a horrible grinding sound because it is trying to auto focus. This isn't a huge concern of mine and not worth sending the phone back for a replacement. It is only annoying but easily stopped by some hard tapping on the back.I usually don't like refurbished products for the simple fact that there are still some complications with the item. However, in this case, the problem isn't major.
            "
"992","Great phone!
            "
"993","The seemingly undamaged Galaxy S6 on the left is former; the iPhone 4S on the right is the latter.After having the S6 for 7 months, when the manufacturer's warranty was still active, the phone's screen started turning colors when plugged into my computer, and, over the course of a couple of hours, stopped working. (I had struggled to turn it on once before but thought it was a battery problem, which didn't seem to be the case when I got it on and there was still lots of battery life.)  ""Have you ever dealt with Samsung?"" someone asked as I mentioned that I'd have to send in my phone for repairs. I had kept the phone in a $50 waterproof case and been careful with it, since I had previously endured the embarrassment of a cracked iPhone screen for over a year.Yet, after I sent it to in, Samsung claimed the phone wouldn't turn on due to damage to the LCD ""beneath the screen""; i.e., even though the screen looked immaculate, it was broken, and they determined it was my fault. They tried to charge me more than $160 to replace the LCD screen, after which they said they couldn't be sure I wouldn't have more charges after they were able to turn on the phone.Contrast this experience with the time I actually *did* drop my iPhone 4S and horribly cracked the screen; yet, it still worked. After covering it with a screen protector, it worked perfectly for more than a year when I bought the S6.I decided to start using my 4S until I bought an iPhone 5S off of Craigslist. (Be careful with Craigslist purchases; make sure the seller will meet you in a phone store where they can check that it wasn't stolen.) My 5S works great. Again, now I understand why people say, ""Once you go Mac..."" This unfortunate experience confirmed for me what so many people have been telling me for years: Apple products just seem more durable.
            "
"994","The phone was received on time. Also, the device is like brand new. Love it!
            "
"995","The phone came today (Aug 7th) and was a few days late of the original date it was supposed to be here. No biggie, I was just super excited lol. This phone requires some sort of tool to open the SIM port on the side that it doesn't come with. I was able to open it with a earring =)....again, not a biggie. Once I got the port open, to my horror, my SIM card did not fit!!! My current straight talk phone uses a bigger at&t one. I had to order a micro SIM card for this phone. Now it's going to be another 3 days before I can use it. *sigh*
            "
"996","VERY NICE
            "
"997","Charging port is worn out

"999","The battery dies so fast!
            "
"1000","This phone is refurbished so I was curious how it looked.  I am very impressed, it looks perfectly new in every way.  I added a Verizon SIM card and it worked perfectly.  All data transferred over to this phone with ease.
