"1","I've only been using this phone for a few days but wanted to share some first impressions.Pros:1. The phone gives you an amazing amount of screen space with almost no bezel and the screen is stunningly beautiful. For a phone of this size, it doesn't seem overly large and being a woman, I have relatively small hands so size is very noticeable to me and whether I can hold and use the phone comfortably in one hand.2. It's also amazingly thin and light for the amount of battery power and life you get. I spent all kind of time playing with it and downloading new apps and it still had 60% battery life. Very nice. Time will tell how soon it need battery replacement, something that's been a big issue for me with my iPhones, how soon they seem to go bad.3. If you haven't had wireless charging before, you will LOVE it. I almost never have to plug my phone in having wireless charging pads or stands wherever needed. The reverse charging is a nice option although I didn't get my free buds yet so haven't had a chance to try them out but I've had other wireless buds and they always seem to start having issues fairly quickly for the high cost. If you are single like me, the ability to charge another phone isn't all that helpful but for families it may be a really nice plus. It does also mean you have to be careful about the case you get if you want to make sure it works with this feature. Ones that support wireless charging are NOT necessarily going to work for the reverse charging.4. Lots of great camera options and of course, FIVE cameras (3 on the back, 2 on the front). This was a big reason I got this camera, and it's a lot of fun to play with them, but see the Cons for my experience with them. Super slo mo video is also very cool to play with. Coming from an older phone, the options here are a joy, particularly the Pro mode. In the past I've had to use other camera apps to get even close to what the Pro mode can do.5. Android OS and Samsung's version in particular is awesome for power users like myself that love to tweak everything. Coming from an iPhone it's a joy to be able to customize my phone so much. I particularly appreciate the one-handed features when using a large phone like this (but see the cons list again).6. Lots of security options in terms of how to protect your phone. Face ID is a fast way to unlock the phone but easily faked, so not very secure. I've had issues with it in the past as well when the lighting is not good. The new fingerprint scanner is supposedly very hard to fake and works in lots of conditions.7. Plenty of space with 128 gig memory to start with, and it has microSD which is nice if you want to load up lots of music and video for a trip (not so much for everyday use). I also LOVE that it still has a headphone jack. The ability of the phone to recharge headphones is nice, but there aren't many that will work with it yet and nothing sucks more than your BT headphones dying and not being able to plug in a backup set of normal ones.Cons:1. The design of the phone is pretty blah and it's super slippery. You want to get a case on this thing ASAP. The sensitivity of it all the way up to the edges makes this even more important, trying to turn it from portrait to landscape without a case seems to always cause it to think I'm clicking on something. I really don't see it being usable at all without having at least a minimal case on to hold it with. Also the plastic screen ""protector"" it comes with is not going to do much protecting and is the kind that is easily rolled on the sides when trying to get the phone in and out of cases.2. Which brings me to con #2. The fingerprint scanner. This was touted as such a huge breakthrough but seems a step back to me from having used scanners on the outside of the case or in a button as they were on my iPhone. First, there's nothing to help you feel for where to put your finger, no haptic feedback or anything to give you help with getting your finger in the right place other than the visual pseudo-button on the screen, and the messages that come up to tell you it couldn't read your print are SO ridiculously tiny and hard to read. You have to press quite hard on the screen, maybe eventually I'll get the hang of it but right now it's constantly telling me to press harder. I've never had that issue with normal scanners. It also makes using glass protectors on the front FAR more difficult as many will render it unusable.3. For as much as the wide and tele lens are touted by Samsung, the quality of the images you get with them are pretty sub-par. At best, you can get semi-decent photos outside in excellent light, but compared to the primary lens, particularly for indoor shots the difference is very obvious. Likewise they talked about having a ""night mode"" that would rival the quality of the Pixel 3, but it's nowhere close. The pictures are far too soft and clearly not using the kind of HDR that Google is using in the Pixel to produce such good low light shots. Outside in bright light shots tend to have blown out areas still. I also get frustrated at how only the normal photo and video modes will allow you to use the wide and tele lens (Pro and super slo mo for instance will not), and how much you have to let the camera control what's happening such as using scene detection (vs. being able to set the type of scene myself). Granted it's still a BIG improvement having a Pro mode at all, but there's still more I want to be able to do. They still seem to think throwing hardware at us will suffice without addressing the software side, but for top-quality photos, the Pixel 3 with its one lens is still going to win out in many situations. Likewise the additional front-facing lens for selfies. I'd much rather have had the wide-angle view the Pixel 3 offers vs. using up space on the front just for a camera to help blur the background. Do they even bother to ask users what they most want?  Luckily the folks at Moment support even these new phones with their great professional addon lens, so I'll be upgrading my kit for their new super-wide angle and tele lens as certainly the performance from the main lens with its adjustable aperture is quite excellent. But I'm glad at least to have the additional lenses built into the camera to use when I don't feel like carrying the extra lenses with me, as I usually don't in my daily routine. But if only Google could deliver a phone that isn't sub-par on battery life as the Pixels have been, they would probably pull even more customers like me over, but as much as I care about my photos looking awesome, I've had my share of having to carry battery chargers around all day to deal with phones that die out too quickly.4. As much as the OS gives me some good one-handed options, the hardware design seems to completely ignore it. WHY are the buttons so freaking HIGH on the phone?! I've used an S9 and don't recall it being this bad. The power button (which doubles as the camera button on a double press) is particularly frustratingly high. The volume toggle as well, virtually impossible to reach without using the other hand.5. There's still some things about the Android/Samsung OS that I find baffling and frustrating. At times I get lost trying to find my way back because something I did sent me off somewhere else. A number of times I've ended up in the Animoji section of the camera app and couldn't figure out how to get back to the regular camera. Far too often it relies on dragging or other screen gestures when a simple menu option to switch screens would be so much more user friendly. Likewise how confusing it is that the Bluetooth setup shows me all these Mac IDs of devices I can't connect to. It's almost comical what that screen looks like in a large gym these days. Why not just show me the ones I *can* connect to? It's definitely not always easy to use a really feature-heavy device like this and not sure I'd recommend it to less experienced users.6. Likewise between all the stuff Google wants to control and Samsung loads on the phone, I feel like I'm turning over my entire lives to these companies privacy wise. I quickly switched it over to using DuckDuckGo for web searches and use other privacy features, but it's concerning how much access these big companies want to what you do on your phone. Samsung does provide a VPN service on the phone you can use as well to help keep your activity secure, but do I trust they are not using that to track me? Given what companies like Facebook have done when people give them a phone number to enable 2-factor auth, I'm not sure I trust any of them anymore.7. Price. We're in iPhone range now with this phone. It's clear that Samsung is justifying pushing the price up with additional hardware features like the improved screen, more storage, in-screen fingerprint scanner and extra cameras. Some are definitely a step up, but others, like the scanner and sub-par cameras, not so much. Some like the reverse charging may in time be more beneficial than it likely will be for most people initially.Overall, this is still a REALLY good phone. However, if you are happy with 64 gig, I'd probably recommend getting an S9+ and saving a good bit of money. There's really nothing on the S10+ that is so much improved that it's worth hundreds of dollars... and some things are a bit of a step backward IMO. However if you really want 128 gig, this phone is worth the relatively small additional bump in price over an S9+ with comparable storage.

"2","Amazon had fast & safe shipping...kudos to them, they did their part. Samsung created a great phone with this one. Snappy OS system, camera is great, battery seems good, I have been downloading and using the camera and battery is draining like any other phone under heavy use. I do believe that the battery on this unlocked version will be better than a carrier version...there is no bloatware running in the background. The screen is just...the best I have ever seen. Size, I like the 10+ size, Its big..I have gym shorts and when I sit...It's poking out the top big. Decent weight (you know its there) so far so good.NOW, a couple things with the phone and the pre-order fiasco,1. The phone comes with a screen protector on it already from the factory, so save your money.2. It does not come with a Sim Card, depending on your situation, you may have to go to your carrier and ask them for a new Sim card...because your old one might not be compatible. (I had to take it to sprint, they gave me a new sim and activated it)3. Do not freak out at the little grey bar on the extreme right,(in the middle past the curve) bezel. Those are not dead pixels, thats the mini menu/quick access thing. Hold and drag left to show the menu.4. The Earbuds situation, I pre-ordered this phone in late February, on this website. I saw an ad on here that said I would qualify for the earbuds. I called Amazon, the rep said ok, he will call Samsung and get the details. I said ok, he called me back later and said ""  log into the Samsung shop and redeem for your earbuds "". He was right it worked, so download the Samsung Shop app, and put in your information and you have to send proof that your pre-ordered before March 8. I took a screen shot of my Amazon page order details.Ok, so thanks, and if your Samsung, ill take a wireless charging pad if you got one laying around you dont need anymore.

"3","I've been using the Samsung S8 for the past two years without any major issues. So I decided to purchase the S10e since it was about the same price I paid for the S8. But after using the S10e for a few days, I don't like it as much. First off, the pixel density of the S8 is about 100ppi higher. Some may not notice a difference, but I do. Small text looks ""out of focus"" on the S10e, but is sharp and clear on the S8. Also, the front camera ""hole"" is a constant distraction when using the phone.The second issue with the Always On Display does not turn off if the phone is in your pocket, and keeps using the battery. From what I've read, this is a ""know issue"" on all S10 models, as the proximity sensor does not work properly. On my S8, the Always on Display turns off in my pocket or if I place the phone screen-down on a table.Lastly, I'm really missing the LED Notification light. All my previous Samsung phones (S and Notes) had the LED Notification, as it was easy to tell from a distance if there was a missed call, new message, or E-Mail. But with the S10e there isn't a notification light that keeps blinking, so I'm always having to checked the Always On Display for new notification.At this point, I'll be returning the S10e, as it feels like a downgrade from my S8. Even if I went with the regular S10, it would have a higher resolution screen like my S8, but would still be missing the LED Notification light and the Always on Display would stay turn on inside of a pocket using the battery. Maybe I'll go with the S9, or LG G8 when it comes out.------------Update:After owning the S8 for the past two years, I first got the S10e and didn't care for it, and exchanged it for the regular S10.I do like the S10 more than the S10e. But with that being said, it's not a huge upgrade from my S8, and is actually missing features.First off, the ultrasonic fingerprint reader on the S10 works about 50% of the time. I even registered my right thumb as Finger 1-4, and it still has issues reading it. The face detection does work (in good lighting) but isn't as secure. What was best was the Iris Scanner on the S8/S9. It was fast, accurate and secure.Next, there is no LED Notification Light on the S10 series. This means you can't easily tell if you had a call or message by a flashing color light, and instead you are dependent on the Always On Display that you have to check. I really missed the LED Notification light when using the S10 and found myself always checking the phone for missed alerts.Now for the good...The screen on the S10 is a modest step up from the S8. I'm not fond of the camera hole, but did get use to it. The Cameras also took good quality pictures, and I'm glad to see a dedicated wide-angle lens (like my LG G5 had). Call quality was good, signal reception seemed OK. Battery life was better on the S10 than my S8.Right now Samsung is selling the S9 for under $350, so I may upgrade to that from my S8, since it still has the LED Notification Light and Iris Scanner.

"4","I am a straight talk customer making the big plunge from an iphone to an android. I expected to lose all of my stuff because of this change but was pleasantly surprised by the Samsung S10's ability to back up all of that information. This was an easy transition to a great phone.
            "
"5","I bought this phone and it came in its usual packaging but not factory sealed. Just a yellow sticker. During setup, everything was in Spanish and I switched it to English and followed through with the setup. Even after setup, many apps were in Spanish. I put my Straight Talk SIM card in and nothing. I couldn't text, call, browse, etc. I'm pretty sure I was sent an International phone. I also kept getting a message that said ""Open channel for BIP"". I had no issues with my Galaxy S9 Plus. For $999, you'd think they'd sent the right product. It's a shame because the phone I ordered was beautiful but useless.
            "
"6","So I bought my phone from another seller who was prime eligible in order to save money on taxes (buying from Amazon directly wanted me to pay almost $100+ making this phone over $850 for the 10e)The seller was very responsive and did give me the 10e like I ordered however, I belive this phone was intended for a Mexico or South American market and not the North American market.I have cpu-z installed on my phone which allows me to examine the hardware on the phone and instead of getting the new snap dragon 855 processor this phone has Samsung processor the exynos 920 processor which is anywhere from 5 to 20% slower depending on the applications used. It can even be slower than last years snapdragon 845 processor in certain video rendering tasks. This is incredible disappointing for me however it did come with a couple of items that did make it a little bit better to swallow such as a free 128gb microsd card and a free case (not sure if that's standard or not) which was a nice touch.Let me be clear this is still a fantastic phone and a great upgrade from my lg G6. But I wish that I had the snapdragon phone instead of this exynos one just for longevity sake. The extra goodies though do make it worth it for me to keep the phone instead of exchange it and reordering from Samsung directly. Plus I don't edit videos on my phone directly so the weakest performance sku doest really affect me too much.I gave it 3 stars just becuase I felt a little decived for paying full price and getting the slightly inferior phone. I also have concerns if Samsung will honor the US warranty coverage the product page advertised.Overall just be careful who you buy from.

"7","I had a few questions before per-ordering the ceramic white ceramic version of the Samsung S10 Plus that were difficult to answer using the marketing material alone.  In particular I was wondering about the physical appearance of the ceramic white S10 Plus.  Well, I received the phone now, so I thought I would drop into Amazon and comment on my first impressions.  Maybe someone else has similar questions, so hopefully this is helpful to someone.Question:  Does the metal band around the ceramic white version of this phone have a rose-gold tone?Answer:  It does has the very slightest hint of pink in the metal.  But let me emphasize here that it is very subtle.  At first glance it looks silver with no color, but when examined closely a hint of warm color can be detected.  And let me also emphasize that it is beautiful!  The contrast against the pure ceramic white back and the clear glossy black front is perfect.  Concern yourself no longer, this is the color to get.  Also keep in mind that all other S10 models have the pure silver band, this is the only version that provides the slightest warm tone to the metallurgy.Question:  What's the deal with the black Samsung S10 Plus S-View Flip Cover, is this official case worth it?Yes, it is worth it.  This black case keeps the phone almost as slim and low profile as having no case at all.  The cover is translucent but appears opaque.  The S10 Plus can detect when the cover of this case closes and then goes into AOD (Always On Display) mode.  This allows the cover of the case to operate like a screen when desired (while still keeping core functionality locked).  When shut, this glossy black case looks almost identical to the phone without a case - the surface is smooth and reflective just like the actual screen, and the touch sensitive isn't degraded through the material.  It also wirelessly charges through the case without trouble.The results of combining these two products - the white ceramic S10+ with the black S-View cover - are impressive.  The case raises the back ever so slightly so that the camera bezels do not touch the surface it is laid upon.  And the black color blacks-out the white ceramic back so that you can maneuver through your day keeping a low profile - a white phone reflects more light and draws the attention of others much more than a black phone - so the case is camouflage for that gorgeous white ceramic.  Even with the case installed, the subtle warm silver bezel is visible at the bottom, the power button, and the camera bezel - and this warm metal against the black case is super cool!So there you have it.  I'm sure others will write all about the latest technical goodies that are also included, but maybe this review proved helpful to someone interested in the visible aesthetics.  The ceramic white with the black S-View case is highly recommended.

"8","Product was opened beforehand and had a yellow sticker on the item......NEW IS NEW and this was not new. It also had a bunch of Spanish and I had to convert it to English so I believe I got an international version. Definitely a way to do business since I notice many other people experienced the same issues.

"11","I previously have S9 for work and iPhone XS Max for personal, here are my thoughts:The Good:- Speakers... wow... I am speechless- OneUI is wow, Samsung finally got the UI right, very user friendly and fluid- Feels very comfortable to hold, much better than S9 and iPhone- Screen is gorgeous, but a little too bright at night- Bixby Routine eliminated my need for Tasker- Headphone jack, although I didn't use it once, but it is nice to know it is there- Samsung Health is very very useful- All hail 8GB of RAM, all of my apps opened within the hour are still there!- Battery life is good (not excellent, pretty on-par with iPhone XS Max)The meh:- Power button is a bit too high, need to adjust grip when turning off screen- Back camera is good, but pretty much feels the same as S9 and iPhone (disclaimer: I am a dummy photo taker, pretty much point-and-shoot)- Samsung still nags too much on ""Here is what you can do on..."" and ""High volume can damage your hearing...""- Micro stutter during animation, rare, but still noticeable during app switch- Fingerprint unlock to home is slow, and it is much lower than I expected, but once I got the position, it unlocks 9/10 times (move your fingers around during scanning, it helps a lot), and I didn't even remove the original screen protector- Microphone is sub-par... especially during call, other side can hear their own echo, not the same experience on S9 or iPhoneThe wtf were they thinking:- Proximity sensor, it is waking up in my pocket ALL THE DAMN TIME (turned off double tap to wake helps, turning off life to wake and AOD solved the issue, but I need to features)- Still very convoluted to pick pictures from Google Photo if I need to send pictures or upload pictures from other apps- Samsung Smart Switch is still a very miss, transferring to S9 to S10 Plus made the phone very buggy, have to start fresh and redo every thing- Samsung Keyboard... sigh... back to Gboard- Front camera... I want to see my face without looking like a 12 year-old damn it- Curved screen, I felt like it is even worse than the S9 (maybe it is the size), a case helped with accidental touches, but my god it is still happening- OneUI is awesome, but the way they treat folders... If I created a folder in the app drawer and put apps there, then put that same folder to home screen, why are they not synced? Why I must add the same app to folder twice? (I don't want to use another launcher, I used Nova Launcher for 6 years and just want to use the built-in launcher for the sake of simplicity)- On the few occasions that I cannot use the fingerprint scanner (enough to be a nuisance), I really miss the iris scanner... this was the #1 reason why I did not pick iPhone to be the work phone before- Samsung Cloud... still cannot see SD Card... just give up already Samsung...- Motion Photo is still not compatible with Google Photo (this has more to do with Google than Samsung, but Samsung uses their own format to save Motion Photo, so I am blaming both)- Power Optimization still sucks (again, Android's problem, not Samsung's fault)So in summary, I feel like each functionality of the phone works very well, but the unify experience is still somewhat lacking
            "
"12","This is a beautiful phone. I've had 4 of the previous Galaxy phones, so I'm very well accumulated with Android and Samsung. Everyone knows how awesome android is and how superior Samsung screens are, they continue to get better each time. Unfortunately the screen is too sensitive to use without a case on it.  You simply can't n't hold the phone without your hands or fingers touching the edges and working against what you are actually trying to press. Once my otter box phone case arrive a day later, the problem was solved! Make sure you get all the full updates before adding your fingerprint.  Mine didn't work at all until the update. For whatever reason.Best phone yet!
            "
"13","The thumbprint reader is located on the edge of the phone. Top right edge and it means that your phone cases need to have a large cut out right by the edge and every case made for this phone will be very weak right there. I guess it's only a design flaw in the sense that phone cases will be hard to make well for this phone. I personally never use the thumbprint reader. I wish this phone had it on the back or just didn't have one at all. Looking for a case that actually just covers this spot since I never use it and would prefer a good case.Ohterwise, amazing phone. Great camera. Very fast. Still has the headphone jack! It's smaller than anything else this nice. Got a lot of things going for this phone!

"17","after using this phone for 3 weeks and coming from an iPhone SE, it is hard to see it as an upgrade in anything other than a larger display.What I like is the display quite a bit easier to read compared to the 4"" screen that the iPhone has.The wide angle camera option on the rear.Dex support to mirror to a television via hdmi adaptor cable.The speaker on it is great for listening to music.No limit on size of download for podcasts.And the size and weight is reasonable for a larger phone.What I don't like is the reduced bezel on the display essentially requires some kind of case to increase the distance between hand and phone, accidental touches are common without a case.The fingerprint sensor is too high/ difficult to reach and the volume buttons are directly across on the other side, causing unwanted screen shots frequently.It is difficult to one hand the phone due to its size and the lack of useful gestures that iPhones have.The app store is lacking quality apps.The camera doesn't have an option of a fake long exposure like the iPhone has. The option to adjust the settings in pro mode are nice but that requires ND filters to have the same effect during the day. (I was able to find one app that is able to do a similar effect but requires a tripod to use effectively, and clogs up the gallery.)The main rear camera doesn't seem to be very sharp and lacks any color depth, anything but very minor adjustments ruins the photo.The wide angle camera is not able to be used in pro mode. It also isn't very sharp.The display is alway tuning on for no reason.Samsung apps require permissions to access everything or they won't update.Face recognition for keeping the display on while reading doesn't work.The headphone buttons don't work properly. To start playing a song from the remote on the ear buds requires three button presses, doesn't matter which app or headphone, I've tried a couple.Antenna strength isn't as good as my old phone.If apple wasn't actively trying to screw over their customers, I'd probably be happier with an iPhone 8.

"20","Samsung hasn't made many improvements to the device since the S8. Sad but true. Yea the camera is a little better, but many of the same quirks and bugs remain. The automatic unlock based on location is still flakey, the screen based fingerprint sensor is hit or miss at best, and my biggest complaint - they've done away with the notification LED. Now you have to unlock your phone to see if you have any missed calls or txt msgs! What the F were you thinking on that one Samsung? But hey, at least we still have that useful headphone jack! Not impressed. 3 stars at best. Truth be told, the Google Pixel is a better device. No Samsung bloatware, no useless gimmicks like a curved screen edge which you can't use when the phone is in a case and serves no practical purpose anyway, etc...

"21","This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the  edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.Camera - not used enough yet to comment.I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version.

"22","Hi this is my first Samsung phone. I love it. Only had it for 2 days. My old phone was a Nexus 4. I ordered the 128 GB version S10+. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package, there was an extra 128 GB Micro SD card. Sweet. Also came with a MintMobile sim chip with 3 months free service. Made my guilt over a 1000 dollar purchase into happy. I had heard and read that the fingerprint ID on Samsung S10+ was hard to use.I used my right thumb, and I have not had a single problem. Very happy with my purchase.

"27","Great phone over all. Camera is awesome, especially the wide angle. Samsung edits their pictures so they look smoother. I do suggest trying out the Google camera APK; the pictures look so much better than any Apple pictures. The battery lasts all day. Recently went on a road trip and the phone lasted all day if you're going to text, play games, watch movies, etc. If I have plans for the night I charge it for 30 minutes and that lasts me the night. The speaker hass alright base, and its loud and clear. The microphone works very well on speaker phone, the other caller can't tell the difference if I'm in a quiet place. If you're looking to upgrade, this is a solid phone. I had the Note 4 before, and waited for a device that wouldn't disappoint.

"28","This phone was ordered via Amazon. At first I was skeptical as to if I will actually receive an official device. Immediately on receipt I validated the device was the real deal via checks recommended on CNET. The device worked great and I was able to easily transfer data from my old Samsung S5 to this new device via the use of a USB cable. The battery life is great. I got 4 days of of one full charge. The features are impeccable. Great choice for an upgrade if you wish to enhance your samsung experience!

"29","Works pretty well, it's not supposed to be the international vs so I'm not sure why it was automatically in Spanish and I had to switch a few things to have it revert to USA English. A few of the app folders it created were also in Spanish but were simple to rename .The finger print scanner is a little finicky but I think it will just take some getting used to and the face scanner is annoying since it's 50/50 if I'm wearing glasses or contacts but I was pleasantly surprised that it still works.The camera and resolution is absolutely fantastic. And I love the one handed option in Samsung products since I hate how big phones have gotten making it hard for me to use with my small girl hands .
            "
"30","Samsung stated that if the phone was purchased by a certain date, the phone came with a set of wireless earbuds.  While I like the phone, I am upset that the advertised ""free"" item was ignored.  The moral of the story - Amazon may not fulfill what was advertized; or, if you pay for something with points, they take their time and accept the order until later.  Had I known this, I would not have rushed to buy it.  Had I not have had this problem, I would have given it another star.  By the way, it does not come with an S stylus like previous phones and tablets.
            "
"31","My previous phone (Nexus 6P) developed the reboot loop problem.  I needed a new phone quickly, and Amazon delivered it the next day.After letting the battery charge a bit, all I needed to do was swap the sim card.  During initial setup, the phone found my backups -- it felt like Christmas morning as a kid.  There's a fair amount of difference between the 2 phones.  I really like that the power button is not on the same side as the volume buttons.  I'm still getting used to the home screen.  Right now it seems awkward, but I think that's just a matter of it being different.Although I don't have enough time with it to rate the battery life, it seems pretty good.  I haven't tried the face recognition -- I'm too ugly.  :-)  I'll give that a shot later.The phone is a bit smaller than my old one, but the screen fills more of the phone, so is pretty close to the same usable area.I'd recommend this phone...  I just wish it wasn't so expensive.
            "
"32","I pre-ordered the phone because amazon told me by chat that they were participing in the galaxy buds promotions of samsung. FAKE, I did not get anything, and now amazon and samsung are saying that is each other fault. They don't want to anything about it.
            "
"33","What I liked about this phone?Lightweight, fast ( but i think it is all new phones, not just this one), loading pages, opening apps, I love the efficiency of it. The screen is amazing and so colorful, cameras takes really goof pictures,also selfies, I am not a big selfie person but even front camera impressed me. I have had Samsung phone before and it served me for good 2,5 years. After trying out different phones like Motorola, ZTE...I happily went back to old good Samsung and planning on sticking to it for a while)What I did not like in it?Slippery, get a case along with a phone like I did, cause you may drop it and you don't want that at all!For some strange reason, on my Instagram pictures are not in the real size and looks like they a bit zoomed in. But it is not a big of a deal at all, just thought I would share this. Also battery life seems too short, but I just think because I am playing with it too much, since it is new.Overall I like this phone, got it in Prism White! Super cute!
            "
"34","I love this phone I was able to use either a pin number or fingerprint to open. I haven't activated face recognition. Everything loads so fast, nice voice recognition for hands free. I have dropped the phone twice both times onto tile floor without any damage. The charge share feature is great. Battery life is awesome and charging the battery is faster then any cellphone I have ever owned. The slim style is great in the hand or a pocket, fits in a front shirt pocket without weighing it down. Hard to believe that a cellphone can produce the great quality of pictures that it does. Lots of storage space with plenty of gb for files and apps. I would definitely recommend the S10 phone.
            "
"35","I just switched to the S10 from my s5e. This phone is amazing! I think it is fantastic the cameras are spectacular and clear! I'm not a gadget expert, but the phone is perfect for me! It does come with a thin glass screen protector already placed in the phone. The volume button does not switch to mute, that is in the setting which is pretty annoying.The finger print scanner is very finicky. You need to place your finger just right for it to work.Works with Strait Talk sim cards.
            "
"36","So my Samsung S7 took a dive and I needed to replace it ASAP.  I bought this ""refreshed"" S10 hoping that it wouldn't be full of scratches that I'd need to cover and it wasn't.  I know the features and am more than pleased with the upgraded device and I got it for a stellar price point.  No VZW payment plans for me!
            "
"37","It's a 256gb version. They didn't clearly state that it's a single sim phone. The model is sm g970u1 which is snapdragon 855 8gb ram. I bought it with confidence that it's a hybrid slot with the second slot being worked with either sim or memory cardOther than that its fabulous. Super fast. Finger print on side is a blessing in reality. Onscreen finger print is attractive but not useful in real life. Side fingerprint has gestures too.The packaging was sealed and its was original. Had all accessories inside it. All unlocked us versions are single sim. Pls confirm with Amazon or seller before buying. Don't make the mistake I did
            "
"38","This is the second review I've made. Along with receiving my phone a week after it was expected, it came straight from the box with chinks in the screen and the screen is so fragile that almost every day a new dent shows up in the screen from just sitting in my pocket (with a case) I don't move around too much. I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much

"40","This product arrived promptly and exactly as advertised.  Factory unlocked?  Check.  12Gb RAM?  CHECK. 1Tb of storage?  Check.

"81","Ok, so I think thst this is a great phone, and while everyone's experience will be unique, I traded in my Galaxy s9, so just a couple of things that stand out.  The camera on the s10e has some new cool features, and the image quality is a bit better than that of the s9.  It takes just a little longer to charge the s10e than s9 (using Noot quick-charge).  I really enjoy the ultra-wide lens camera, that's something that LG been having for a long time, and I'm glad Samsung picked up on that.  The finger-print sensor can be better, will see how it is down the road.  I got a Supcase case (check the Cnet's drop test article, Supcase scored really well there).  And of course, the new wallpapers are amazing:)

"96","I received my att Samsung s10e march7th and set things up March 8th fully. I had a little bizarre problem setting up, but did a factory reset and this phone is AWESOME! I give FULL FIVE STARS. I was a two year owner of Samsung s7 edge with KNOX setup and those that have this know how slow things can get. With S10e all problems gone! Vanished! It is blazing fast. Same apps. 6GBemory now. Probably faster 128GB phone flash memory. Reusing my 128GB Samsung micro SD card. It's easily 10x faster and no delays compared to S7 edge. Att was giving a very great deal on these with 2 year commitment. Its physically smaller than s7 edge but bigger screen. Fingerprint sensor is in logical place and I use it all the time. Build quality is excellent. When I upgrade family, will be on these devices!!!
            "
"97","I miss my s9. The s10 fingerprint reader is very slow and often fails to recognize my fingerprint. If there is any dust or moisture on your finger, it won't work at all.Considering the size of the battery, I thought it would last forever, but it's no better than the s9.The camera specs looked amazing but the low light performance is underwhelming. The video quality is very good, but many of the features are disabled when using UHD@60fps, no video stabilization or tracking auto-focus.
            "
"98","Ordered this as a birthday gift for my sister.  She took it to Verizon to activate it and was told the IMEI was already linked to someone's account.  So essentially the phone was stolen and resold.  Going through the return/replacement process right now.  Hopefully the NEW one isn't also stolen.  I'll update this once we find out.
            "
"99","Overall, I'm sorry I upgraded. It's fast good processor and lots of ram, but the fingerprint reader is clunky and the Bixby button is a total deal breaker. I don't think I'll ever buy another phone that has such a button. I'd hold out for something else. At $1000, you should be happy.
            "
"100","Everyone knows how great the phone is in pretty much every aspect, but I will address the two most annoying things about this phone and the solutions that worked for me.1.  The fingerprint scanner is fancy and supposed to be secure, but it failed miserably when I saved my fingerprints the first two times.  I had about 50% recognition only, if that.  I thought I had it figured out with a pattern of scanning the print, but then I found a video on this trick and worked better than anything else I tried before.How to fix it:  Instead of scanning the same fingerprint 16 or so times at different angles, to get one single fingerprint profile.  Start scanning once your right thumb, for example, and when repositioning instead of placing your right thumb again, use your left thumb, then your right thumb again, and so on until you complete one fingerprint profile.  I was amazed on how fast and how accurately the phone recognized both prints.  Almost 100% recognition now.2.  The badge count was, on purpose, messed up by Samsung.  For example, when you swipe down and dismiss a notification, the badge count goes away, counted as addressed.  Some people like the way Samsung did it, but I do not.How to fix it:  The is no way to fix this with the stock Samsung one UI.  I had to install Nova launcher Prime.  This allows the count to remain when you dismiss a notification.  In the same way, if you have 50 emails, and delete one, the count will go down by one on the badge, and not make all of them go away the Samsung designed it.I hope this helps someone not be as frustrated as I was.
            "
"101","Just got my S10 (128GB) yesterday. Best phone I've ever owned, no question about. Improvements over the S9 - it's faster (snappier response to pretty much everything), the screen is very impressive, and it's somehow bigger and smaller at the same time (more screen, less total device volume). The on-screen fingerprint scan is nice, but I had become used to the old one just fine (although, I suspect I had perpetual fingerprints on the S9's camera lens). The facial recognition is MUCH faster than the S9. I have not yet exercised the camera enough to declare it's value versus the S9, but I always found the S9's camera to be excellent. So, 5 stars for the phone itself, hands-down.Now... Samsung. Every time I purchase from them directly there seems to be some ""gotcha."" This time it was the ""free earbuds"" offer, apparently I missed something in the fine print at order time so I'm out of luck. OK, I would have bought the phone anyway, but they seem to over-promise and under-perform. I'd prefer they just promise what they can deliver and deliver what they promise. Why sour me on a terrific phone over some bogus marketing offer? (Just for reference, when I bought my S9 I went through a similar jumping-through-hoops process). Anyway, that's why a terrific phone earns only 4 stars instead of 5.

"102","Exceeded my expectations!. Outstanding battery life compared  to any other phone I have ever owned including the note 8.  The screen is awesomely brigh,  face recognition and fingerprint sensor works great - for the 1st time they got it right. Also, photos fantastic I don't need my nikon anymore. The video is smoother than any cell phone I have used. Has a smaller footprint than the note 8 with the exact same screen size.  It breaks my heart to ding them one star for all the junkware that came on this phone that I had to remove -  plus preinstalled a CNN app that I cannot delete so I could only disable it. Other than that is an awesome phone.

Now you have to go into your phone book and find the person you want to call. They also made it where it is not compatible with my 2010 Ford SYNC system. I may have to look into I-Phones next time.

"107","The GS10+ is a great all around phone. It's fast. It's well designed. I like the hole punch compared to the alternatives. Too bad the camera is downright mediocre compared to the competition. In a world of Pixel, Huawei P30 and iPhone, Samsung has to do better.

"108","This is an all around amazing and beautiful phone. The fingerprint scanner is extraordinarily fast, the screen is so so so beautiful, the camera is so clear and I use the ultra wide angle all the time. I have found myself taking pictures way more times than I would regularly do with my old phone.  The face recognition isn't the best. My sister, who happens to look a lot like my,  was able to unlock my phone. The hole punch is barely noticeable, and the battery is great. I usually end the day with about 30% but that will vary with your own usage. Overall it is great. I have added some pictures I took with the great camera

On top of that having the possibility of adding extra storage and a headphone jack are what made me choose the S10 over a Pixel 3. The fingerprint reader can use improvement but I use the face unlock, so it doesn't bother me much. I can definitely recommend the phone.

"119","<U+00A0>I have just received that phone yesterday. It is amazingly fast comparing to my old Samsung phone. I have yet to discover all the features.Phone came with fast charger, Samsung headphones, charging cable, Micro USB to C adapter, opening tool.  I was able to easily activate it with Metro PCS. I took my old micro Sim card of my old phone, made couple of cuts on the outside of that card I made it smaller to the size of a nano sim card required by Samsung Galaxy S10e.  I was done with activation it within 15 minutes. Everything works perfect including calls over WiFi.So far I am pleasantly surprised with this phone. With included adapter, I connected this phone with my old phone and transferred all my data and apps to new phone in less then 5 min.I have to admit that this phone feels a little bit slippery and in my opinion requires a case to handle it better.Front screen protector feels extremely smooth so there are no fingerprints on it. It feels glassy smooth. Amazing.Now, when I'm writing this, I've had this phone for almost 5 days.  SCREEN:From what I have seen so far, the Camera and a Video quality on this phone is superb, just like I read in various reviews.I recorder couple of video clips and when played on this phone I was blown away with how sharp and crisp the picture look like. My friend, when he saw that asked me if this was 4K display. It is so amazing.Also, this display has really dark blacks and all pictures and video looks better on it then on my LCD monitor or my TV.  CAMERA:Camera has lots of features that will take few hours to explore. I love 2 lenses, wide and regular that allow you to capture everything you want. Picture quality is Amazing. Photos taken with this phone look better then from my regular camera.This s10e has optical image stabilizer when shooting video. There are 2 options. Stabilizing and smooth stabilization. Both of them give you super smooth video. Video stabilization on this phone is better then on my $600 Sony camcorder with optical stabilization. I was amazed how much better footage looks comparing to my Camcorder.Again, I was blown away but LOW LIGHT performance of this camera. I was taking pictures in very low light conditions and picture looked perfect. I can take much better low light pics then when using my regular camera.  BATTERY:On my first day I was using it almost nonstop trying to learn all the features and battery lasted me all day. It was 23% at 8pm. There are great 3 battery saving modes that allow you to adjust battery consumption and your app power load. I posted a pic showing my battery at 35% and in most restricted power mode I have more then a day of battery left. With this extreme mode you still have access to your email, Web, SMS, camera and gallery. Love this option.  FINGER SENSOR:Finger sensor is on right side. Once I scanned fingers I use to unlock it works 99% on first touch. It is fast and easy way to unlock your phone. Super easy to use.  BIXBY:I think it will take a while to use BIXBY more frequently but I see potential in this Samsung version of Alexa.My old Samsung phone had option of speech recognition in Polish for typing. This one does not and this is a bit disappointing.I will post more updated as I learn more about his phone.Manual has more then 200 pages and I really need to go through it to learn all the features.I've posted few pics taken with this phone as example of perfect camera quality.Enjoy you phone. It is worth it.UPDATE: May 9, 2019I stopped using Bixby. It's useless. I started using Google assistant 3 weeks ago and It is 100 more superior to Bixby. Google assistant can understand my accent, whenever I speak foreign names to dial my phone. Bixby could not even understand name Jose. Google assistant rocks on this phone.

"120","I had very high hopes for this phone because of the form factor but my S9 is just so much better!  First, the haptic home button is gone!  If you have any security enabled you cannot long press the home button to bypass the lockscreen, double tap to wake will not do it.  The call quality is not the greatest, the signal strength is terrible compared to my S9, the fingerprint scanner is WAY too high and the smart lock feature barely works even after GPS calibration!!  UGH!!I am reviewing just the S10E!  I have not used the other S10's just to be clear.  Sad they choose to lump all the reviews for all the S10 line but that is not my choice.

During setup I had to push way too hard on the screen for it to register my fingerprint, and once set up it failed to recognize my fingerprint more than 50% of the time. I tried different fingers and tried re-registering them twice. Even tried a factory reset. Huge disappointment, had to return it. Getting the Note 9 instead since it¡¯s $350 off.
            "
"122","Finally upgraded from my Galaxy S5.  This S10e is FAST.  I love the new UI. It's very easy to use and intuitive. The battery so far lasts an easy 15 hours with wifi on, streaming videos and TuneIn radio. I got the 256Gb model which is a lot of space coming from a 16Gb phone.  Plus I added a 400Gb SD card.  Purchased a VAVA usb-c hub and the S10e switches to DEX mode on my 55 inch tv and works perfectly. Call quality and volume are great. The wide angle lens camera is excellent.  PRO mode lets me shoot in RAW mode for more photo editing ability. The side fingerprint scanner is a little high in the placement but I'm getting used to it.  It is extremely fast in response time for unlocking.  The phone arrived fully sealed in it's original box.  One thing to note.  I thought I read somewhere that the S10e comes with a case in the box.  This was not true.  Not a big deal.  I just had to order a new case to go with the phone.  Overall very happy with this purchase
            "
"123","Bought this to use as a phone, of course,  and something to play PubG Mobile on. The S10 is way more unstable and buggy than my S9 as of right now. The S10 is as fragile, if not, more fragile than the S9. Accidentally dropped my phone from my computer desk and now the whole bottom right of the screen is full of cracks and completely shattered in a concentrated spot. Very disappointed. So far, I haven't seen any real improvement over the S9.
            "
"124","I love this phone.  It was a pretty seamless transition from my old S5 to the new S10+.  It's fast as lightening, has almost as much memory as my desktop computer, and I haven't had a single issue with any apps I've put on.  Getting used to not having the indicator light was a little weird, but the ""always on"" function does let you know when you have notifications while the phone is sleeping, so you just have to get used to using it a little differently.  Other than that, it has all the bells and whistles of new tech with the familiarity an Android user would like.The one thing I was really unhappy about was the offer of the free Galaxy wireless ear buds if you pre-ordered.  THE BUDS DID NOT COME WITH THE PHONE.  Samsung makes you register and wait for an approval before they give you a STORE CREDIT that you can use to buy the buds with.  But wait!  There's more!  They must have only had about 100 of the buds in stock, because they were gone when I went to order them with my credit, one week after receiving the phone.  That was SIX WEEKS AGO and they still don't have them back in stock.  When I went to the Samsung site to ask when they'd get them in, the only thing I was told was to put them on my ""wish list"" and they would notify me when they were back in stock.  Oh!  And the credit EXPIRES ON SEPTEMBER 1ST.  So if they choose to not stock them until after that, you are SOL if you want the supposedly free item for pre-ordering.  Nice scam Samsung.  I won't fall for anything you offer for free again - and will likely ditch using your phones too once this one dies.
            "
"125","So I have been using the phone for a bit over a month now. Often I find myself using the pattern unlock vs using the finger print reader, as it can take a few times to get it to unlock with my thumbprint.Battery life is just meh and it seems to take a long, long time to charge. I bought a wireless fast charger that was Samsung and Samsung certified but it takes like 9 hours to charge up the phone if I let it get down to 10 to 15%.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0797F2V5C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Corded charging does work better but it's still a slow charge compared to the nexus 70% charge in 15 minutes.I have used the built in batter saver app and even cutting everything down and scrimping wherever I can I find it drops 10 to 15% of its charge overnight just sitting on the dresser doing nothing. If I am using it to just listen to music a few hours can eat 30 to 40% power. This is not streaming, its music that has been downloaded to the phone. This seems like way too much power usage for this.The screen seems vibrant and colorful. However, It also has wrapping issues, where text and the picture often are fitted off the edge of the screen. I was looking through the Samsung app store and they had an advertisement for one of the apps. It took me a couple minutes to figure out one of the words as it was so far off the screen. The word was world and all I could see was the WO...I find this annoying. The screen is also smaller than what I expected the Plus model to be.I did like that it integrates with my car pretty well and the maps has a cool feature that will allow you to display the map from a satelite view. However, I found that if i tried using this mode while trying to play music, the sound and map developed stutter and played choppy. However, I did like that it (in general) did actually show the speed limit of the roads I was traveling and I never saw that on my old Nexus and is a feature I missed that you see in almost every cheap GPS unit.Cellular signal is much worse than my previous Nexus 6 P device. I often find in places where I had 3 to 4 bars of signal on the nexus I often get 1 bar and I see the dreaded ""no signal icon"" pretty often, especially when on the drive home. Once again, my Nexus did not have this issue, so I have to assume that the antenna in this unit is just not as good.I do like the Bluetooth on the unit, it has a setting that lets it send Bluetooth to more than one device. I think this is a great feature and something Bluetooth should have had for a long time now. It also seems to remember the volume settings for individual devices. I really hated on my Nexus having to constantly turn down Bluetooth for my headset and then turn it back up the moment I hopped in my car.I do not like their Bixby app but there is a whole button dedicated to this ""Samsung"" app and although I tried disabling the app and the button. Neither were completely successful and there is no way to remove the app.Overall it¡¯s an okay phone but for what this thing costs it should be a great phone. $500 to $600 tops in my opinion would have been a much more fair price.I also did not like the fact that Amazon just tossed the phone in the shipping box, not inside of the S10+ box like it should have been so mine arrived with a scratch on the screen. I do not blame Samsung for that part though.
            "
"126","Loveeee the phone. It's amazing without a doubt.I really thought the S10 would be fine for my hand size....guess time to go for the +
            "
"127","I travel all over the US and Europe and this phone works great.  Sleek form, fit, and function-- A+.  I purchased an armband for running/working out and the phone has had zero issues.  Important note to all purchasing, the phone 'comes with a pre-installed screen protector' which is solid.  My wife has long acrylic fingernails and was unable to peel it from the screen.  Overall I'm satisfied with the phone upgrade (upgraded from an S7 Edge).  My only issue is all my previous charging cables for the S7 are null, as the S10 has a different charging port requiring me to purchase new charging cables.
            "
"128","The box came open and while I ordered black I recieved silver and the phone came scratched.
            "
"129","I upgraded from S9+ to S10. In general it is great smart phone. One of the great feature that the processor is super fast with downloading or surfing the web and very stable. However I have the following downsides on the S10: 1. The finger print recognision is not as easy or smooth to unlock the devise, S9 finger print is faster and more accurate. 2. Battery life in S9+ does last longer than the S10.
            "
"130","The phone itself is beautiful and works well, battery life could be better. I received a phone that has issues with connectivity to the network. In talking with the sprint customer service it seems like I'm not the only one experiencing this.
            "
"131","Very nice phone but this model of the phone does not let you turn off the camera shutter sound no matter what I have tried in the settings.Someone please tell me how if you have found a solution other than using a 3rd party camera app.
            "
"132","The phone arrived, but I thought pre-order comes with wireless buds
            "
"133","Finally I can confirm that Samsung truly makes the best smartphone overall.Huawei is knocked down now and iPhones are technically way weaker phones.Screen, camera, speed and battery are out of this world.Thumps up for Galaxy S10.I used to be iPhone customer for many years and now is over.
            "
"134","I bought this in ceramic white unlocked. This is supposed to have the dual sim but it seems like you can only put one nano sim and one micro sd.
            "
"135","I preordered the S10e and received it 2 days before official release.  I was stoked they were sending them out early.  I won't go into much tech detail since others will do that for me.The pros is I love the size, weight, and overall appearence of the phone. Camera is great.  Getting accessories is alot easier than my S7 Active was.There is only 3 cons to this phone.  The first is the battery. Mine wouldn't last nearly all day. I had to turn off and disable almost every app to preserve battery life.  So after being at work with it on silent for 8 hours then coming home and using it to play games and shop amazon for 5 hours. It was 15% by the time I went to bed. 2nd is not a biggie since I imagine I'll adapt soon.  The edge to edge screen is awesome but if u play any games you need to hold the phone with your fingertips because the slightest bit of skin hits the edge of the screen and you will be doing something in your game you don't wish too. Lastly the colors aren't as vibrant as my S7 Active. Side by side and the clear loser is s10e. Maybe there is additional settings I don't know about yet but I eventually get around to looking it up.Conclusion:  I will keep this phone and continue to use it (mainly because I can't return it and will give it a decent chance), since the only thing I do on cell phones is make calls, text very little, occasional web surf, and mainly play games.  I did keep my S7 Active.  Dispite the S7 Active being 3 years older it still has a superior battery, it will last almost 2 times as long as the brand new S10e.  Any trips or hiking I do I will switch the sim card back to my trusty workhorse.
            "
"136","My last Galaxy was a S8. Samsung has made some changes since then. One of the most noticeable for me is the strong push to use a Samsung account rather than a Google account for apps and other features. This made it difficult to set up the phone as I wanted. I didn't keep it.
            "
"137","Just received my new phone. Very fast delivery, every thing looks good.
            "
"138","I'm glad I bought this expensive a** thing. I regretted it at first, but I mean.. its a phone. Its OK to spend this kind of money on a device that rolls with you 24/7. It's specs are beefy and I havn't had any real issues.
            "
"139","Great seller and, I loveee my flamingo S10 phone which I couldn't get in Canada so I ordered it to my hotel during my recent trip to Vegas.  I love everything about Samsung's minus battery life and find the fingerprint annoying most of the time so I just use my password  I purchased a clear case with pink edges off Amazon as no kiosks had nice cases that were clear. Highly recommend.
            "
"140","This is a really good product. First I got the empty  box, then replaced it with new one. No complaints  about that now. But s10+ is really cool, it's factory unlocked.  Works with all networks.
            "
"141","I just got my phone yesterday  so I'm just getting  used  to it. So far it is great. I love the camera. How fast it is. But the home ""button and back button "" aren't really buttons they are right under the keyboard  so I end up hitting  them all the time. Only drawback so far
            "
"142","Yes I like it very well especially not having an edge screen. I really like a flat screen better. It¡¯s very easy to work like my s9 was.

"151","I ordered this for the snapdragon 855 processor and  US warranty. Instead I realized that I had received the slower international version with the exynos processor that is even slower than the s9 processor. The model number of the phone I received is completely different from the model number on this page. The US warranty is also not honored. I found this out after setting up the phone and looking under the about phone option. I am returning this phone for sure. Don't buy it here and risk getting a inferior phone when you are paying 1000 dollars. It's really disappointing.
            "
"152","Overall I'm quite happy with this phone, but I do want to share a few small quirks and annoyances I've come across.I like its overall size, though it does seem a bit heavy.  It is small enough for me to slip into a pants pocket, but because of its weight I definitely know it's there.  The display is beautiful, and I love that it goes all the way to the right and left edges of the phone -- in fact, there's an ""Edge"" feature which allows you to pull in a special customizable folder/menu from the side of the screen just by swiping it.Now, a few quirks/tips:1) The fingerprint reader does work, but as other have noted, it seems to be finicky.  Through trial and error I have discovered that one of the most important things you can do to assure your finger will be read properly is hold it VERY still while it's pressed to the sensor.  Yes, you do have to press with sufficient force but not ""too"" hard, but I have found that the amount of pressure I exert seems to matter far less than holding my finger very, very still against the sensor.2) The power button is on the right side of the phone, and the volume up/down buttons are directly across from it on the left edge of the phone.  Unfortunately this means that depending on how I'm holding the phone, I often end up pressing the ""volume down"" button while I'm pressing the power button, which causes the phone to take a screen shot.  It's not the end of the world, but I end up having to delete a lot of unintended screen shots.3) As others have noted, you will definitely want some sort of case for this phone, as it has virtually no grip and it would be sad to see it hit the pavement.4) I have heard some people complain about the type of screen protector the phone comes with.  I, for one, have left it on the phone because I actually like its feel -- it is smooth and doesn't seem to have much ""drag"" on your finger like some of the silicone-type screens.
            "
"153","Its a good phone.  Not great but good.  Going from the S7 to the S10 was quite  change since the front physical button went away.  I love the full screen but definitely miss my button.  The fingerprint detector normally takes me a few times before it unlocks which is the only main frustration in my book.  The second minor grump is sometimes when it is unlocked the screen looks as if its still locked so I continue to touch it before I notice that it is actually open and you just need to swipe to make it look open.  Maybe they could change the blur to the app icons immediately when the fingerprint works?The speaker is a huge improvement.  Music and phone calls sound even more clear than with the S7.  It also seems to have a much louder volume ability with apps such as spotify which was an issue with the S7.  The camera(s) are a big improvement as well.  Lots of photo options and even better pics in dim areas.The processor speed is also noticeable.  It opens apps and slides flawlessly.  Very smooth operation and video is almost instant.  I am pleased with the purchase and am hoping they can fix the few bugs mentioned before with software patches.
            "
"154","Summary: Great upgrade from Galaxy S7 in terms of screen resolution and speed.Pros: Bluetooth distance has improved, battery life is better, fast response time (using Nova Launcher), very good signal, improved storage space, fingerprint reader works great for me, body feels solid and looks amazing, unlocked version runs almost all the Verizon branded apps, USB-C is fastCons: Fingerprint reader is hit or miss,high price, latest Android OS unable to record calls with ACR (thanks Google!), needs protective case for curved glass, not a lot of color choices, doesn't run all the Verizon branded apps, USB-C requires changing all non-wireless accessories or getting gender change adapters (they're cheap but an inconvenience.)Conclusion: Even without a good trade-in deal and 24 months same as cash financing, it's a worthy upgrade.

"155","+rants=Get this one (Snapdragon 7mm), not the Exynos (8mm) because it's faster!, I come from an exynos region but ordered this one in because I always knew of that discrepancy in performance between the variants over the galaxy s history. Check the benchmark reviews. Also, this one has FM RADIO receiver in it, just plug in a headphones to act as the antenna and use NextRadio app to not stream, but receive actual fm radio signals from the local area. The Adreno GPU is faster than the exynos one by a good margin if you're going to be playing games like PUB-G. Bixby is ultra smooth on this, compared too ocassional hiccup on the s8. That 8GB of ram surely helped there. The One UI is the best i've seen so far... it has all kinds of new things in it. the software is alot more friendly now,-rants=I dont like the silver sides, preffered the all black like s8. (getting a black/+ish case to help with this), and the hole punch notification led simulator isn't enabled yet for some strange reason? - i dont want to have to install 3rd party apps for this which will drain the battery! this should be part of the system right now. edge lighting is so old and the other option is to use the camera flash what the hell? The fingerprint sensor could take some getting used to, it's advised to register the same preferred finger 2 or more times to improve the hit-rate, and i've done that and it works (samsung is planning an update in the near future to improve this.that's all for now.
            "
"156","Screen is gorgeous, phone is fast and responsive, cameras are great.Here is the problem: the signal strength is piss poor. I never have full bars and the phone constantly drops calls and goes to roaming or no service. This apparently is a known issue (google s10 signal strength). Seriously, I can lay my phone without a case, right next to an s7 edge, both on sprint, and there is a 10% signal loss on the s10. Samsung gives me the run around. I wish I had never bought this phone. I¡¯ll tell you this much, after using Samsung phones for over 10 years, I will never buy another one.

"158","I really liked my new Galaxy s10+ but one thing bothered me so much I returned  the phone: I cant put Alexa on it and I cant get rid of Bixby. I guess I wouldn't mind Bixby being on the phone if Alexa conversation worked but it doesn't and after trying for quite a long time, I decided to return the phone and find something that would work better for me. Too bad, but that's how todays technology is moving

DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE UNLESS THEY ALLOW US TO DISABLE BIXBY  !!

"160","Easy for vendors to say what a great phone this is, but for a newbie it sucks ! There are way too many features, that only sometimes work, but then maybe I just got a bad phone! There are not many videos yet on this model,so you are pretty much on our own ! The phone does a really good job of interrupting what you are trying to do with lots of advertising.

"165","For the most part I like the cell. However,I've had technically issues. I had to contact straight talk to assist with my data being picked up and they had me add an APN just to take care of that problem. Next two issues are with the text messaging. There is no archive feature for my text like I could do with my other cell. On top of that, I can receive attachments but not able to send any. I talked with straight talk support, Samsung support twice and even Amazon support, and no one could figure the issue. I even did a factory reset and still nothing. I'm returning the cell and ordered another that is sold by Amazon and not a different seller. If it doesn't work with the replacement then I'm done.
