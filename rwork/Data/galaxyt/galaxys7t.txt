"1","This is both a 1 star and 5 star review. Beware, not all refurbish companies are created equal. I purchased 2 Samsung Galaxy S7's. A black one for myself and a gold one for my wife.-The gold phone was refurbished by Exclusive Electronics and the workmanship was horrendous. The home button was replaced with a very poor quality aftermarket button, they installed it crooked and it looked as though they painted it gold with finger nail polish. The finger print bio metrics (which is built into the home button) did not function properly. You had to try 4-5 times to get it to unlock, every.... single.... time..... It kept giving a message to ""wipe home button"". I cant wipe off the gold finger nail polish!  Secondly, now i cant explain how they screwed this up, but the word Samsung on the back was crooked and off center. Now this isn't something I wouldn't have cared about had the phone worked properly, but again, it goes back to craftsmanship. Ok, so now I've popped in the sim card, booted the phone up, went through the set up process and guess what! More problems. There were occasionally light/color waves that would travel across the screen. It failed a simple Samsung security update 6 times before I finally got it to work by doing through my computer. Oh and it would constantly drop service and just show an X next to an empty signal bars triangle. I'd set my identical phone next to hers, on the same Verizon network and I would have full bars and 4G LTE data. Lastly, they also provided a cheap aftermarket charger. The charger was extremely hot after being plugged in for only 20 minutes, and of course it didn't support fast charging.Now, onto the black phone. This one was refurbished by Vius.-phone looks and works like brand new. Battery lasts all day. They provided an OEM Samsung charger, it works properly and supports fast charging.I called Exclusive Electronics to get a replacement sent out and their message said they opened at 10 am. I called several times starting at 10 am and no one turned off the auto message so the phone wouldn't even ring until 10:30. They must have had to stop off for more gold nail polish on the way to work.I was provided 2 options for solve the issue: Option 1: send the phone back to them, and they would send out a replacement, leaving my wife without a phone for at least 5 days. Option 2: Buy another phone, wait to receive it, and then return the defective item to them, tying up yet another $320 on my account.I chose option 2, purchased a gold Galaxy S7 from Vius, and guess what, phone looks and works like brand new. Battery lasts all day. Provided and OEM Samsung charger, works properly and supports fast charging.

"2","When we got the phone, the previous owner's information was still on the phone. That was bad enough, but now, after just 4 months, the phone has crashed and is completely dead. Even though the phone appears completely fine, hasn't been dropped, and hasn't been wet, Verizon employees said it was done. Unless this seller follows up and something changes, our recommendation is to avoid them.
            "
"3","This cell phone was available from a number of different sellers, with mixed reviews across the board, and almost the same pricing.  I opted to go with Dealfisher and  was very pleased with the entire order process.  See a ""seller review"" separately.  As far as the phone goes, I was a little bit hesitant at going with a refurbished unit, but it was almost $250 cheaper than purchasing new from Verizon.  I'm glad I took the chance.  The phone is to any non-technical examination brand new.  Not a scratch, rub mark or any other discernible indication that it has ever been used before.  It did NOT come with a sim card, or memory card, but that was clearly indicated in the product description.  What I did not know was that the Galaxy S5, that I was replacing, has a ""micro sim card"" and the Galaxy S7 (the new phone) has a ""nano sim card"".  They are NOT the same.  That's the bad news.  The good news is that my local Verizon store (NOT and authorized vendor, but a ""real"" Verizon store), installed a new nano card in a couple of minutes and then, since they weren't busy, cross loaded all of the contents from the old phone to the new...at NO cost!  It can't get better than that.  By the way, the memory card IS the same for both phones.  Hope you get the same great results I did.  Cheers...Ed B.

"4","Phone looks and acts like it's in absolute brand new condition. My phone came with they legitimate Samsung fast charger, USB converter too store information, and a set of really nice Samsung earbuds. The only thing that doesn't scream this is brand new phone is that it came in a plain white box and cost $250 less than new!
            "
"5","The phone is missing the Verizon Voicemail app.  And spoiler alert you can't add it.  According to Verizon support it is something that has to be added when the phone is first configured.  Also per Verizon they say this means its not really a Verizon phone, its just a phone that will work on the Verizon network.  Ultimately what this all means is you can't tell if you have a voicemail, how many voicemails you have, who they are from or when they were left.  You have to dial the voicemail number and then listen to each message in its entirety and then check the info on the voicemail to get any info about it.  For someone who lives their life by their phone this is a no go.  If this would have been disclosed in the product description I would have picked another phone.

"6","Certified Samsung refurbished phone had many problems out of the box. After-market accessories, charged very hot, screen had a light 1/3 section that jiggled, black colors were green, speaker cut in and out, mobile reception strength started out half of previous phone and decreased to near zero.  I would rate this refurbish very poor quality. I give this less than a star.
            "
"7","The phone was supposed to be an upgrade in terms of performance and battery life.  From the start, we disabled a number of apps we didn't need (SHealth, etc) to ensure the best battery life, but it rarely lasted my wife until mid-afternoon with light usage.  Recently the phone has started dying with no notice when it hits 30-60% battery (see screenshot).  We've tried doing a factory reset, clearing the cache, everything I've found, but still have the problem.Worst tech decision we've made - and of course the problem only became true failures after the return-window closed.

"8","Specifically looked for listing of Verizon phone and paid extra to get it before work on Monday. Went to activate at the Verizon store and found out this s7 works on the AT&T network! Called number for dealfisher a couple times and only got voice mail. Returning phone and not happy!

"10","1st, verizon tech tried 2 new sim cards would not work. put sim card in from my iphone 7 & phone activated, not supposed to. 2nd, unknown apps from europe & netherlands constantly trying to download, this went on from 8pm to 6am when i shut phone down.  was 100% charged @ 8pm & down to 10% @ 6am.  It would not do screen shots.  Verizon tech & i tried to put phone in safe mode & this would not work, i could go on & on, it cost me my time @ verizon store 2hrs, plus time re-downloading all my apps, ring tones.  for a company that showed 99% reviews favorable what a scam.  additional cost of zagg screen saver & protective case.  also time on face of phone kept rocking between pt to military time, wierd, plus giving bogus local temp.  110 outside phone showing 76. Ordered wireless charger to go with phone,  tried to save some$ but in the long run ordered new from verizon.

"11","I purchased this phone for my mother because she was due for an upgrade.  The phone arrived and it's appearance was immaculate.  Charged immediately and appeared to work well until the power button on the side caved in and is no longer functional.  We've already purchased and applied the new tempered screen protector, and moved all of her contacts, photos and accounts  which we'll have to do again and unfortunately her old phone was sent for recycling so I had to purchase another phone to replace this one before I can return this one.
            "
"12","LOVE the phone, but unfortunately the first one I was sent was defective.  After about 400 phone calls, I finally got my hands on one that WORKS properly and I'm in love. Never thought I'd be happy to leave Apple, but I definitely am!
            "
"13","*Edit: About 45 days in, the phone stopped charging, completely bricked it. If that wasn't bad enough, the next morning the charging port actually started smoking. This could have happened while I was sleeping. Sending it in, I'm told that I'll get a full refund, and I'll post if there are any problems with that. Regardless, this is absolutely disgusting. My child's photos and videos are on that phone, so we can't get those back. A refund (under warranty) seems minimal at best, seeing how the phone is going to cost me precious memories, missed business calls until I get a replacement, and could have potentially caused serious damage had it caught fire. Learned my lesson.*Original Review (5 stars): I was a little apprehensive towards purchasing this phone after reading some of the reviews, but my phone came perfect. Mine was refurbished through Kiss Electronics Inc, and it came with the wrong charger ($8 on Amazon) and the paint was starting to come off of the fingerprint scanner. I haven't noticed anything wrong with the speakers, the battery works about as well as expected, and the phone had no problems getting on the Verizon network after I got my SIM card. No complaints so far, will edit if something happens!
            "
"14","Update: after rebooting the phone 5 times and doing a system update I was finally able to use the fingerprint sensor to unlock my phone. I should not have had to go through all that frustration,  but I think I may have fixed the problem.  :(I would give this company zero stars if I could. I received the phone and when I put the sim in I keep getting a notification that unauthorized actions have been detected. Because if this, I cannot use many apps, including the fingerprint security and Samsung¡¯s own Health app. I have restarted the phone to no avail. I then did a factory reset and that didn¡¯t work. I still get the same message. This phone is a piece of you know what. I am sending it back for a full refund. Unfortunately, this company will probably just send the defective phone to the next person who orders one so buys beware! <U+0001F621><U+0001F92C>

"15","For what it's worth, I bought my phone from DealFisher and it was great. Battery is very strong and only one or two minor scratches that suggest this thing was hardly used. It was no trouble getting this phone switched over to my existing Verizon service. Last thing to note was that my package just included the phone and charger without any other extras. That's fine with me. Just happy I got a good one!

"16","Great phone overall when battery isn't dieing. Purchased this phone thinking it was great deal since it was refurbished. However my battery life is horrible phone dies in like 2 hours. I need to get a battery replacement now. Phone performance is good and has very nice camera. I'm just a little salty because In Constantly having to charge my phone.**** I had to get different phone battery was horrible feel ripped off

"17","BEWARE-Phone aesthetically looks great.-Charge port is loose.-Unable to get rid of software update notification (run update and it still keeps coming back up every time.  Tried factory reset and didn't fix problem.-Battery life is very bad.  Complete discharge within normal conditions (very little usage) from 100% at 6am to 45% at 10am to 0% by 2:30pm.  Not possible to replace battery since it is a integrated battery / device.-Called customer service and they will issue a refund or replacement but I have to go without a phone until new one arrives after they received this defective one.-I have to go to Verizon to get a micro SIM (had to cut old one to fit GS7 nano SIM slot) for my old device just to send this one back, or go without a phone.UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE OVERALL.

"19","I bought this phone to replace my aging S4 that was still working but getting tired. The S4 was in an otter box all it's life and had a few battery replacements since i bought it new. Back in those days smartphones were free when you signed a 2 year contract so I had a bit of sticker shock when I went phone shopping. I'm over 60 and retired, I just don't need the latest gadget filled cell phone.I read all the reviews for this S7 phone on Amazon and found a wide mix of comments from junk to like new condition. The thing that sold me on this one is that Amazon certified it with this statement ""A Certified Refurbished product has been tested and certified to work and look like new, with minimal to no signs of wear, by a 3rd party distributor""Certified to work and look like new from Amazon's description means to me I could return the phone if I was not completely satisfied with it's condition. The 3rd party distributor for my phone was Kiss Electronics.I live in SoCal and ordered the phone with Prime 2 day delivery, to my surprise it arrived the very next day!first Impressions,I opened the prime box to find a generic phone box inside. When I opened the phone box I found the phone, a wall charger, and a phone number for Kiss electronics customer support, that's it. No manual, no release key for the sim card and no instruction manual. I was soon encouraged by the like new external condition of the phone and I saw what appeared to be a factory original peel off plastic screen cover on it.  I plugged it into the provided Amazon marked charger to find the battery was completely discharged. I found a safety pin to release the sim card holder and quickly realized my old S4 Verizon sim card was way to big to fit. The next day I went to the Verizon store and they happily supplied me with a nano sim card. I asked them if they could transfer all my old contact info from the old sim to the new one and I was told that is not possible. Now that I know about the sim card data transfer problem, I would have used google in advance to back up all my data first before going to the Verizon store. Oh well, I transferred all my data the old fashioned way, hey I'm retired, who cares.After getting the new nano sim card installed I was ready to try out the phone.I turned the phone on to update my contacts, then decided to check for Android operating system updates. I found that it was currently running Marshmallow 6.0.  I updated the first, then the second, then the 3rd. On and on for a total of about 7 different operating system updates, it took a few hours to complete all the upgrades. It updated all the way to Oreo v. 8.0. This is when I realized this must be a new old stock phone that has not ever been operated or used before.I had read that manufactures (like Samsung) often have many brand new phones that are earmarked for their warranty exchange programs. I suspect these phones were new phones that were not needed by the manufacture and were sold at auction to various electronic device distributors (like Kiss Electronics)I have had the phone now for about a week. After removing the bloatware and configuring it the way I want it, I am very happy with it. I would highly recommend this phone for anyone on a budget or whoever doesn't need the latest and greatest cell phone on the market. I rate my entire experience with Amazon and Kiss Electronics A+

"20","Please don't waste your money.  This phone worked for approximately 2 months.  I was happy with it at first, and thought I had saved myself money getting a refurbished phone.  Over the weekend, for no apparent reason, my phone broke.  It was fully charged, but would not turn on.  If you plugged it into the charger, it would annoyingly buzz and try to power up, but it would not do it.  As is the case with most people these days, this phone is my sole phone.  I use it for important business calls.  If there was an emergency, I'd need to use this phone.  So, I had to go out and buy a new phone (which in hindsight, I should have just done initially).  I called the seller to see about sending it back and getting a refund, since I was under the impression there was a 90 day period after buying it where that could be done.  NO.  They told me that was not an option.  The only thing I could do was send the phone back to them to see if they could figure out what was wrong.  Again, THIS IS MY ONLY PHONE, so the several days involved with shipping it to and from and the troubleshooting time, would in no shape or form be acceptable.  Furthermore, they told me that Amazon iteself would NOT LET THEM refund my money, since it had been over 30 days.  That simply does not make sense.  In the end, I have learned my lesson.  Do not buy from this seller.  You run the risk of throwing your money away on a faulty product, and they aren't going to take it back and own up to selling a piece of junk.
            "
"21","I went to Verizon, AT&T and US Cellular and none of them could figure this phone out or hook it up. None of them knew why. I couldnt find any APN settings. This phone was just weird. Wasted my money. By the time I was done trying to hook it up it was too late to return it. So now its a device for my step son to use at home with wifi.
            "
"22","So when I was initially looking to buy a new phone I knew that I didn't need the newest or shiniest phone so I decided to buy a phone that was a few generations back. But I debated about where to buy a used phone. I researched for a long time and went back and forth with a lot of websites and Amazon had the cheapest price, which made me both happy and a little bit warry. But I decided to go with the phone on Amazon, I choose my seller carefully to a one that had good reviews and a high quantity of reviews. When it came the phone had no defects and looked brand new! It didn't have a  sim card (but I knew it wouldn't) All in all great phone great deal! I waited to write my review for a couple of months just to make sure. So I highly reccomend buying a used phone.
            "
"23","Perfect quality and flawless performance. I had a brand new Galaxy S7, which I lost after about 6 months of use, and I decided to replace it with this refurbished S7. Because I had been using the exact same (but brand new) phone just prior to using this refurbished, I can undoubtedly confirm that this performs the same, and it looks and feels brand new as well. No scratches, no dings, not even any dirt or dust in the speaker grill etc. At first I was hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone, but all my worries were for no reason with this seller. Thank you!
            "
"24","Phone did not have software compatible with Verizon and so cannot be activated. Despite multiple attempts to factory reset and to update the software through Verizon's software tool on my computer, I cannot use the phone with a new SIM card from Verizon. Since it was sold as a Verizon phone, that renders it essentially useless to me. After spending 2 hours on the phone with Verizon tech support, following by 2 hours of my own time attempting to reset the phone, I'll be returning this for a refund. I still have no phone, after waiting over a week for this one--an enormous waste of time for a useless device.My options now include rolling the device and waiting another week to get a new phone from Amazon/this seller, or switching to another seller and phone on Verizon. Either way, I'm left without a working device for another week.

"25","Aside from a little rash around the charging port from being used, the phone was like new. No scratches, no issues. phone been working great so far. Bought it for my wife, I may order myself one now.UPDATE: 09/12/18I purchased this to replace my wife's Galaxy S5 (I am still using mine).  Since she bought it I have not been happy with her call quality.  I have a hard time understanding her unless she speaks deliberately and clearly.  5 months later I realize that we are not being connected using the HD Voice option on Verizon phones. The ""Advanced Calling"" options are not present on this phone.  I spent hours with VZW Support and Samsung support to no avail.  Samsung told me that a phone that has been unlocked does not have these features.  Verizon says that this must not have been a Verizon phone and that's why it is not available.  The phone I bought from Deal Fisher was supposed to be a Verizon phone and was not listed as an unlocked phone.  Ultimately I am overly disappointed.  My S5 has way better call quality and now I am hesitant to replace it with another one off of Amazon.
            "
"26","My wife's old phone was dying a slow death, so we decided to have a look at what was available. Personally, I think it's absurd to spend 1,000 on a cell phone. Powerful laptop computers only cost 400, so it's nonsensical to spend that much on a device that's likely to end up dropped on concrete and shattered into a million pieces. We decided to go back a few years and see what models were available for dirt cheap. Honestly, there were huge differences between cell phones from 2011 to 2012, but from 2016 to 2019 isn't such a major jump.After doing some research, we concluded that a refurbished Samsung Galaxy 7 was the best option. The 8 was about 150 more than the 7 and the 6 was only 50 dollars less. Our research was from just a snapshot in time, so I recommend to anyone looking for a new cell phone to simply compare prices and features for about an hour. Write the numbers down in a spreadsheet so you won't forget, and you'll be able to make the right choice at what's available. Yes, it takes about an hour, but this is to avoid spending 1,000, so it's worth it.The one thing you have to consider when buying refurbished is that there's a slightly higher chance that the phone will die on you. However, there is also a chance that a brand new phone will die on you (it's lower, but still there). The advantage with refurbished is that you're only spending a fraction of what you'd spend on a new phone, and you can turn around and buy a new one if you need to and still save money.Ours has worked so far and my wife is very happy with her purchase.

"28","I purchased this to replace my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 that bricked on me last weekend.  The refurbished price is so much better than new from Verizon.  When the phone arrived, it was in a plain box, and no OEM charger (but I have one from my other phone so no big deal).  The phone works great!  Setup was a breeze.  I've used it pretty heavily the past week (so many new features with latest OS) - and it's great. No complaints.

"29","After reading some of the reviews I was a little uneasy purchasing this, especially selecting the gold one (given the 1-star review of Oct 2017) but knew I could count on Amazon's return policy backing me up if I got a junk phone.  Well, I didn't get junk.  This baby ROCKS.  I upgraded from the S5 to this and cannot believe the performance difference.  I knew Samsung had put a next-gen chip into this phone and that the S7 was the first model to sport this major upgrade but I was not expecting this much of an improvement.  I've even been happy with the battery life - I expected that to be mediocre, too, but pleasantly surprised.  I don't really know what else to say - I am extremely happy with this and considering purchasing two more for the other two lines we have.

"31","So far, so good.  It is very hard to tell that this phone is a refurbished phone and not new.  I received it last Thursday and have been busy installing updates, apps and accounts in order to switch over from my existing Windows phone.  I have not activated on my Verizon network but I have verified, by swapping my old phone's SIM card into the S7, that it could connect to the Verizon network in CDMA LTE mode.  Once I've configured it I'll need to go to a Verizon store, get a new SIM, and activate it.  Other than that this refurbished phone seems like it will work just as expected with a new phone.  I will update this review once the activation is complete and I've been able to put it to actual day-to-day use.

"32","This product seemed I lot better in the description.  Truth is, after about 2 weeks of owning this phone it blanks out on being able to send and receive text messages,  Thankfully the texting begins to work either a few hours later or up to a week, yet after it happens once, it continues to happen every couple weeks,  I tried to return this product but the seller said it was already past my warranty,  it had only been around 2 - 3 weeks.  I know your thinking I just got a lemon, I didn't.  Why?  Because after a week of having this phone I thought it was great no flaws,  I recommended it to my sister who was looking for a cheap new phone.  After she had received her phone mine began to disfuntion.  It took hers the same amount of time but after about two weeks both our phones were unconditional and the seller refused both of our warranty.  I very strongly do not recommend this product.  If I haven't been clear enough : DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS A TOTAL SCAM!!!!

I knew it was fully charged, but it wouldn't respond to any button pressing.  I tried plugging it in this morning with no effect.  Later my screen lit up with nothing but static.  I'm not sure what  to replace it with.  New phones are prohibitively expensive.

I love the ""always on"" screen that shows the time and date as well as certain other information. Really a handsome phone that is the right size for me.The only reason I have not given it 5 stars is that I don't have my sim card yet, so I can't actually use it as a phone, just wi-fi. But I will have that installed soon and I imagine it will be wonderful.

"36","I wasn't sure if I wanted to try a refurbished phone but when I saw the prices of cell phones (new) I thought, why not give this a shot.  I did what other reviewers recommended and read the feedback from each seller first as other reviewers said not all sellers refurbish the same.  Great advice!  No one wants to get a lemon of a phone.  I picked the phone sold by Platiunum Deals.  Lightning fast delivery, well packaged and the phone looks and feels brand new.  Functions perfectly, no issues at all.  Easily connected it to my Verizon account.  I am VERY impressed with the quality of Platinum Deals refurbishing efforts on used devices.  If I ever have to get another phone for myself or a member of our family, we're going to go this route and look for this seller again.  Excellent quality!

"37","In general, the refurbished S-7 was a nice phone in terms of the screen, camera, size, etc. However, from the start I could not get my voicemail, most of my texts could not be delivered and it could not accept Samsung updates (a good candidate for the source of the problem). Verizon tried to fix it with no success. I've given up on refurbished phones The previous one, a refurbished Samsung S-6, began shutting down for no reason after about six weeks. I learned how to boot it up again but after a couple more weeks it began shutting down after a few minutes. I sent it back and got the S-7. I have a new Moto g6 and it works well. For a cheaper phone, I couldn't be happier. (Note: I do not use the phone for gaming so I cannot comment on the g6's gaming performance.)

I will be sad when I actually have to give up my S7 for something else.The shipping was quick and the packaging was fine.I will say that the battery life on my phone was so short that I was charging it 4 times a day. I purchased a replacement battery and replaced it myself. It was a little tricky but worth it because I love this phone.The camera on this phone is great. I take tons of photos! I have yet to run out of room. I also use my phone to record videos and it's fine!

"43","Product works as a phone. Headphone jack does not. I don't have time to return it because I actively need a cell phone for business. I'd appreciate changing wording from ""Refurbished"" to ""used"" or ""broken"". Just so consumers are clear on what's up. ""Like new"" should be pretty clear and apply to things that are, yknow, like new. Thanks.
            "
"44","There was some visual wear on the home button where the gold is coming off but it seems to work fine. The battery life seems to be pretty decent. The rest of the phone works great. It does not include the little key to open the SIM card slot but this is an easy fix if you buy a SIM kit or just go to a wireless store.
            "
"45","Whoever this phone belonged to before me (the seller) knew that this phone had an issue, that is why it was sold for such a cheap price. Yes it was a refurbished phone, BUT still with an ongoing issue. This phone requires a system update all day everyday, but once it is done, nothing reflects that update and then it asks for another update. It is a never ending request! I have to keep allowing the phone to update and reboot and I do not have another phone that I can use to send this one back. I can make and receive calls, text, etc. for the most part, but the last phone that I had was a decent phone, it just did not have enough storage space and a terrible camera, but it did not require updates every morning or every night! I need storage space and a great camera with great pictures. I am disappointed and I have NEVER done a bad review about anything that I received through Amazon! (I do understand that each seller is different, but this could cause issues in the future)

"46","I bought this after my s8 was stolen. Sure it's waterproof is a ""smartphone"" but that's where I draw the line. Somehow because it's been refurbished this just doesn't want to work properly. My snapchat app in particular just refuses to work- one app, whatever. But what's worse is that the LED had a strange tint across the entire screen almost like a blue light filter (not enabled) and seemed to have an icon fade from the previous owner's layout. It also doesn't work with other settings like trying to change the ringtone- it refuses to use anything but the system default. It's been 6 months so I've given up on that by now. The charger that the phone came with? A joke. Broke in 2 months. The home button seemed to ""scratch off"" so it looks like it's been chipped away. I have a very good case so unsure how this happened. I tried to contact customer service for a refund/replacement within 30 days but I guess the ONE woman who has to process that wasn't there that day? So after calling the next day a man tells me that he can only process a 10% refund because the LED problem was a ""minor problem"" but I didn't have my order number on me so I had to call back. When I called again, the next person I needed to talk to was not there. So I gave up. It still works, but disappointed in the ""refurbishment"" skills for the price. Would NOT buy again. Buy a new Motorola for the same price.  I should have gone through with the return. Also the battery lasts less than 7 hrs with medium use so good luck bringing it to school/work without a charger. I think new this phone is good but refurbished is not. (Side note: I've been buying Samsungs my whole life).
            "
"47","Really nice phone for the price! Everything on it is perfect, except when I try to play music through the aux cord in my car, it has a loud, annoying static sound that won't go away. I can bypass this though a bluetooth adapter, though, so it's not a huge issue, and it's the only issue I've had thus far. Everything else works amazing and it looks like new. Another minor issue was shipping. I ordered this phone last Thursday and paid extra for one day shipping, but the phone arrived the following Wednesday. The phone is nice enough that it wasn't a huge issue, but definitely don't pay extra for one day shipping or expect this phone to arrive in a hurry.
            "
"48","I would not consider this a certified refurb. It came with generic charger that wasn't useable so I'm using a Galaxy S charger I had from another product. Phone charges to 100% but does not stay charged more than 12 hours even with very limited use, notifications and smart background off. Wish I had spend the extra on something more certain. ANY Certified Refurbished ELECTRONIC Item Ive purchased previously always came with a name brand charger and good battery life therefore I am disappointed.

"49","We decided to purchase an S7 for my wife (the year is 2018) because her iPhone 6 crapped out at the 1st sign of water. She saw how mine has been with us since our wedding day in reliability, functionality, so we decided to get a refurbished on Amazon since they don't make them anymore. She loves it, although there's a learning curve coming from iPhone, it works great and the battery life is like it was new. Were running these bases boys into the ground.
            "
"50","I bought this phone to have an extra phone to play Pokemon Go on for my daughter. I also thought she might use this phone for her personal use with the 32 GB. She has only 16 GB on her current phone. She didn't want to switch so now it's extra. But now to the phone, The phone came very quickly and was packaged nice. I have set the phone up and it works great. The only complaint I have is the battery drains very fast. I bought another unlocked phone and I compared the two phones both Androids and I charged them to 100% after 2 hours the other phone was at 98% and this phone was at 67% That was a dramatic drop with no cell service. I only hot spot the extra phones and for it to drop that much is way to much. If I was to use this phone as a regular phone I would not be happy but as a mobile gaming phone I just keep it on a charger. Plus it gets warm very fast it might need a new battery.
            "
"51","My S5 was starting to feel sluggish.  Seeing reasonable prices for refurbished S7's  I decided to upgrade.  Wow!  The Galaxy phones always had a bit of a cheap feel to them, but that is not so with the S7!  I always put my phones in an otterbox case so the cheap feel didn't bother me much, but the home button definitely feels more solid.The phone is quite responsive and looks great.
            "
"52","I am mostly please with the purchase. The phone looks great cosmetically and works great. Only problem is with the battery. The battery is not good and I would have rated this only 3 stars. I get about 6 hours of light use before phone's completely dead, 2 hr's to 3 hr's max if I'm talking on it and have the blue tooth earpiece connected . We have another S7 we purchased new about 18 months ago, and when configured identically and placed side by side with the one we purchased from Kiss Electronics we can see an obvious difference on remaining battery power within 10-15 minutes. However, I called Amazon customer service and explained the problem. They quickly offered to credit me $20 so I could purchase a new replacement battery, which I have ordered and will swap out with the bad one soon. So, I've raised my rating to 4 stars because of the incredibly responsive customer service response and my belief that a new battery will resolve my only problem with the phone. Lastly, the S7 battery replacement process looks to be a little more than just a quick swap out. It involves special tools, heat gun, etc (I suggest watching a YouTube Video before attempting this battery swap). I will update this review after I replace the battery.

"53","I've ordered a number of used cell phones and had to send a few back. The ones from Prime Mobility have always held up and outlasted any others! This S7 was great. Amazing condition and everything synched up right away after putting my SIM in. Battery life has been good as well. Will always go to Prime Mobility storefront first!!
            "
"54","A refurbished phone that looks new.  I upgraded from an S4 and the speed of the S7 is much better along with 16 more GB.  The colors are crisp and I love the ""push the home button twice"" feature that takes you directly to the camera.  Great phone!
            "
"55","Seems to work pretty well, been using this for about 4 months now and it hasnt been slowing or breaking down so far. Comes with charger but the adapters kind of a knock off, it works fine but of course its not as good as the original fast charging adapter. Nice of them to apply a hard plastic screen protecter since there us a very and ever so slight crack on the screen but pretty unnoticeable when using it but I had to remove the protector since it made the touch screen less sensitive and can barely activate any button. Also overtime the battery may drain alil faster, I try to restart my phone every once a week or turn off battery saving when Im home to lessen the problem. Overall good price and works well!
            "
"56","So glad I decided to purchase Amazon certified refurbished.The phone I received was like new and fully functional. No problems activating it to my Verizon account. Battery life lasts all day with medium use. Came with a Samsung quick charger. I couldn't be happier with the performance and quality of this phone.
            "
"57","I suspect these were overstock sold off when the newer models replaced them as mine appeared to be factory fresh with no signs of wear.  Maybe I was just lucky?Anyway the phone works great, it was easy to set up, and everything is as expected . . . . although I had hoped for longer battery life it is more than adequate and hopefully maintains.
            "
"58","Few scuffs and scratches but it was refurbished so no big surprise. Phone was completely dead so I put it on the charger. It started to charge for less than a minute and the charging box made a really weird noise then it popped and stopped working. The phone went off and came back on by itself. I guess it was a problem with the charger because I've had no problems with the phone since I started using my old charging box.
            "
"59","Put both fill silicone case and tempered glass screen protector. Something internal on the phone disconnected after a slight bump. Glass not broken or anything, but screen won't turn on.  Stuck having to shell put another 250 bucks for a phone from a different seller.

"60","We were so sad when my husband fatally crunched his relatively new (to us) Samsung Galaxy S-7 cell phone - right after we had ordered a new case for it.  We were thrilled the KISS electronics could replace it with a refurbished phone at a reasonable price.  We have now restored all of the features that were on the old phone and life is GOOD! Thanks, KISS!!

"61","I bought this item.  The description said ""The batteries have at least 80% capacity relative to new."" I charged to 100% and unplugged before I went to sleep (12:25am).  I woke up (6:30am) with 5% battery.  6hrs 5mins of idle screen off = 95% battery use.  Also, I watched youtube for 40mins from fully charged, to 15%.  This is after I tried many things to optimize the battery and half the brightness.  Hope everyone reads this review before they make a decision.

"62","I've been a Samsung user since 2012, and over the course of 6 years I've had the galaxy S3, Galaxy, S4, Note 5, and this phone (S7). I'm not sure if it's the phone's status as certified refurbished, but this is the laggiest phone with the shortest battery life of any Samsung I've ever had. I probably charge this 4x a day, using it from about 10am to 10pm. The functionality is all right, as it hasn't fully frozen yet, but even texting causes a lag. Maybe it's just the device I received, though, bc this doesn't seem to be many people's experience?
            "
"63","Great phone! Had it for a few days now! Everything is great, got it on time. Came with a lighting charger. Still waiting on a SIM card in the mail to know if the phone works when activatedUPDATE: had the phone for a while now and my data stopped working so I restarted the phone and I won¡¯t turn back on it just vibrates/ had it on the charger for maybe an hour and still won¡¯t come on. I looked it up and it¡¯s common for this phone. It was great until I restarted it :(
            "
"64","I was skeptical ordering. Was assured it would work on Verizon. Has Verizon logo on back. Hardest part was getting a SIM card cause it is an older phone and I had to drive over an hour to a Verizon corporate store on a busy weekend.  Husband loves it. It¡¯s his first smart phone.  No complaints so far. Questions were answered quickly. Fast shipping.Def recommend this seller and this product.
            "
"65","This was an upgrade phone for me, and I really like the phone. It has been easy to use, the battery life is wonderful (my old phone wouldn't hold a charge throughout the day anymore). The price was great, considering I was looking at phones for three-to-five hundred dollars. Very similar to my old Samsung phone, so easy to figure out some newer features.
            "
"66","The S7 arrived in perfect condition.Couldn't tell the difference, between Refurbished and NewSet up was a breeze. I would buy it again.
            "
"67","OK I can't really afford phones, I have Page Plus and need unlocked phones. I had an S3 and the highest I could afford was an S7. It looks like new, its fast, it activated just fine with Page Plus. I've had it about a week and am very addicted. I am comparing this against my S3 but I'm very happy with this purchase!!!
            "
"68","This phone was advertised as Verizon Wireless. Ordered the phone, received it and then took it in to get activated at a verizon Wireless store. When they attempted to activate it they said they can not activate it neither could corporate so I would said they straight up lied about this phone being Verizon wireless compatible and if this is a common occurrence they are a FRAUD.
            "
"69","Arrived on time and in excellent condition.  I installed a separately-purchased Verizon SIM, contacted Verizon for activation assistance and was up and running less than 20 minutes later.  I should also add that the battery works as though it had been replaced and the case is free from any signs of wear.  Excellent value.
            "
"70","Worth every penny, the screen wasn't scratched, looks like brand new, I like the new features of the S7.  Upgraded from an S5, such a difference
            "
"71","I was a little concerned ordering a phone online, but it was a great experience.  Arrived Timely.  Looks brand new.  No wear and tear at all.  The battery is so much better than my Note 4.  I do miss the camera on my Note 4, but still good quality pictures.  I actually like the smaller size.  Fits in my pants pocket and it is much easier to deal with on a daily basis.
            "
"72","I managed to get my old phone switched to this phone with out a problem but I believe the touch screen is not right. It randomly shows as if I'm clicking all over, send random gibberish and opens crazy apps. I tried powering down and can't touch power button since the touch screen shows as if I'm touching randomly all over the screen. It's extremely slow and glitchy where apps just start flashing and close. I can't type a text with out having to hit some spots in multiple areas and tack out letters not really typed. Last night it was at 6% battery and after sitting on my night stand charging for 2 hours was only up to 12%
            "
"73","Out of this box this phone was almost like new. Just needed to get a sim card from Diamond Wireless and everything works like new. Functionality works as expected and the S7 is great phone overall. This is a great product and even though a couple models old, performs admirably in comparison with all of the newer phones.
            "
"74","This phone was a refurb but was In great shape.did not come with SIM or fast charger.  The biggest complaint is the way Samsung changes the menus and options from stock Android.  Some settings are hard to find. Others aren't there.  Love the fingerprint sensor and the wireless charging. Screen is super bright and clear.  Camera is top notch. I especially like the slo mo.
            "
"75","Constantly dropped signal. Never able to call, but sometimes texts would work.Returned itBought from buySPRYThey were helpful, but couldn't get me another in time so I went with someone else.Also the thumb button was scratched.The phone itself was awesome though! Love the photos it takes!

"76","First-time used phone buyer here. I read a lot of reviews before buying a refurbished Galaxy S7. Most were negative, but I took a chance anyway. I'm only one week in on this purchase but so far, I'm very pleased. The only indications that this isn't a brand new phone are there's a bit of dust/crud in the charging port, and the after-market charger vs. a Samsung-branded charger. Otherwise, it seems to be in perfect condition. I did have to do several software updates back to back, but I don't think that's unusual.
            "
"77","Mobilespee said phone was a Verizon wireless phone which was not. Phone would not hold a charge, would not update. Verizon representative tried to install information but phone kept shutting off so they couldn't get anything through it. Guess you never know what junk you buy it sellers are dishonest!!
            "
"78","This is a much more fiscally sound purchase than a Galaxy S8 from the carrier. I had some reservations about it being refurbished and worried the the carrier would give me trouble when I got it activated, but everything has been just fine.  :-)
            "
"79","I got about what I expected, the battery nearly lasts a work day (9hrs) while streaming music. Tbh, it's underwhelming that the battery life is so short, considering that my last phone did the same, only loosing 30% battery. I Would return and use my old phone if I could see the screen on it.Aside from that one glaring issue, I like what I have received. Sleek, but not slick, clear image on screen, nice camera in-and-outdoors (though it's been overcast and I don't know how it does in direct sunlight). It's a little slow to load some things, but its almost unnoticeable.
            "
"80","Contacted this seller after the warranty for a simple question.  They responded that the phone was out of the 90 day warranty and that I should take it to a local repair shop.  But then they said they are always there for questions and to help.  Not true.  I wasn't asking them to take the phone back or repair, just a question about the fact that it would not take an update.  I fixed the problem without their help.  But no thanks to them.  Do not expect any help if you buy something from them.  I will not buy from this seller again.
            "
"81","Has worked very well ever since I got it - 2 months now. A good way to save money on your phone.

"82","My refurbished samsung galaxy 7 came flawless, and, after inserting Consumer Cellular sim card, and 64 gig storage , and learning my new phone, it does some amazing things, and, takes cool photo's and videos on voice command.
            "
"83","I bought one of these phones back in August 2018. I had a GREAT experience with it. The only thing that got replaced on mine was the battery during its refurbishment. It was the newest phone I ever had and it performed well with all the apps that I got on it. The camera was more than enough for the normal occasional family photo. I had no problems with it through its life but unfortunately, through my own clumsiness, I broke the phone to a point of disrepair. I had such a great experience with it that I'm more than willing to buy another one now.
            "
"84","We received this phone with a poorly placed screen protector that had dust stuck under it. Upon peeling it up we found the screen scuffed, and the home button worn completely down and scratched. Disappointing, especially considering shipping took a week.
            "
"85","No problems.  Always look at ratings for the refurbisher you order from.  My refurbished s7 has performed like new for a fraction of the cost of a new phone.
            "
"86","I originally looked into buying a refurbished Samsung Galaxy S7 because my older sister recommended it. I considered several other phone models and brands in my search for a new-to-me phone. I finally decided on a Samsung Galaxy  S7 because I had heard good things about it from many people. I was hesitant to buy a refurbished phone (despite my sister's recommendation) because of several other bad reviews. However, when I received the phone it looked great! I just transferred my Sim card over and it worked right away. I have been using this phone for about three weeks and it has not given me any trouble. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend a refurbished phone.
            "
"87","Does not come with the USB-adapter as other reviewers have mentioned. Comes in a plain box with the power cord and fast charger. The phone is flawless on the outside. The back of the phone says ""REFURBISHED BY ASURION""  etched into the metal, underneath the IMEI number.
            "
"88","Has enough processing power for apps/games. It rarely crashes, and battery life is decent. Only problem I had is I cannot download or install visual voicemail app which is a must have feature. Verizon customer service rep had to set voicemail so I manually have to call in to check it. Bleh
            "
"89","Got this for my husband, after all the problems HE has with cell's, he likes this one!Fast shipping, just as described and in minutes it was running on our Verizon!UPDATE, the phone has died, they have sealed battery and it just won't charge any more, didn't even get 1 year out of it, so sad!
            "
"90","Screen is in near excellent condition (one miniscule scratch you have to look for). Back has expected wear from a cheap case.  Only real concern is whoever had this phone before obviously hadn't heard of gently plugging something in (paint scratched off in several areas around charge port area).  Overall though for a refurb and less than half what I paid for this model new last year, not too shabby!
            "
"91","The only signs of wear are the witness marks from the previous owner's case and a scratch on the home button. The button and fingerprint reader work fine. The screen is perfect. Battery seems pretty good. Processor is pretty quick. I did have to go to the Verizon store to get a nano sim card as my existing sim card didn't fit (this was free & painless). Perfect buy for those that aren't cool with spending $600+ on the newest smartphone.
            "
"92","I'm honestly blown away at this phone. I ordered it expecting the worst, despite the great reviews. I have had zero issues with my phone in the 2 weeks that i got it. The only thing that i questioned was the fact that i had to do 4 system updates, but once it got caught up everything was great. The phone looks and performs as if it were a brand new phone.
            "
"93","I have not had a phone in about 4 years.  I was a bit trepidicious about getting a refurb.  However, this one has been just great.  Battery seems to need a charge at least once every 24 hours.  I don't know if that is normal, but it is way better than my old beaten S4.
            "
"94","Just like you, I read and reread all the reviews until I made the leap but I'm really glad I did. I chose Edge Cellular because they had the best feedback. I got the phone the day after I ordered it and was ecstatic.  All my worries were gone, its perfect.  However, today I did notice that the headphone jack doesn't hold the little metal end of my headphones. (The phone came with a fast charger and a set of headphones which was a pleasant surprise.) Anyways, I can always buy a set of wireless headphones.  So go ahead and buy the damn phone already. If you don't like it, return it. <U+0001F60A>
            "
"95","I have friends with the same phone,  and even running just the factory installed apps my battery life was terrible compared to theirs.  I ended up buying a replacement oversized battery and opening up the phone and replacing it. Kind of a pain, but that's life when you buy refurbished stuff I guess.
            "
"96","Bought reconditioned from Amazon.  Just like new.  Best Phone I've ever owned.  I usually wait and buy last years model to save money.  The only reason to upgrade is probably the camera, but this camera does a superior job.  Shipping was very fast.  Thank you Amazon.
            "
"97","The phone seemed to be working well, despite the home button being cracked (which only functioned 1/2 of the time). After 3 months of use the camera just randomly stopped working. I have exhausted all available options as far manufacturer reset etc.,but it will not work. The cost of having someone figure out what is wrong with the camera is more than I paid for the phone. Something to consider....most apps will not work on your phone if the camera is broken. Somehow it causes a malfunction.
            "
"98","Upgraded from a Galaxy S5, a lot of improvement. Love still using the Micro charging cord. Love the double click on the home button for the camera. Easy to maneuver. Faster. Battery life is awesome after having to replace my S5's battery to last me more than half way through the day. Charges fast with an off brand charger too. I've never been one to buy a brand new phone, my refurbished ones always work well for me!
            "
"99","This phone does what I need. It isn't so large it can't be put in a pocket, which is important to me. I put a Zagg screen protector on it and have it in a case and with a bit of luck it will last a couple of years. The cost to replace with a refurbished was about the same as I anticipated spending on repairs. Unfortunately, modern phones with water resistance include glues that are difficult to remove to make a repair a self-service option unless one is truly determined.
            "
"100","I ordered this, came in three days, took it up to Verizon, and within half and hour I was on my way with seemingly a brand new phone.  I do not see any difference between my phone, and my sisters who we bought brand new from Verizon a few years ago.  It was very easy, and affordable and worked like new at Verizon.  The phone itself was blank, with generic Google apps.  No earbuds, but that wasn't in the description.  It did come with a charger, and plastic wrapping around it.  I had a really great experience, would do again.
            "
"101","Packed well. It arrived Monday and I only ordered it Saturday! This phone was sold as as refurbished, but it seems just like a new phone. I see no evidence that it has been used and the battery performance is great. I paid a little more to get it quick but it was way worth it!
            "
"102","It's been just over 3 months since I bought the phone, and already the charger port is finnicky and a pain. I will add, I only charge when the battery is low and never overnight. If the phone isn't held at a specific angle, it will not charge. Should have just bought the s8 from Verizon directly.
            "
"103","Buyer beware! It says Verizon Wireless but these are not Verizon Branded phones. That means no voicemail and several other key apps that can only be pre-installed by Verizon. You cannot get these apps from play store or anywhere else.
            "
"104","No, it wasn't a hundred percent perfect, but I still count this galaxy S7 as the best phone I've ever owned. The battery life sucks because Samsung add bloatware to a perfectly good phone with an excellent battery. That's why I looked to root it, remove the bloatware, adjust it for better battery life. It takes nothing away from the phone, however. Excellent solid phone, and I bought it used and refurbished. Not a complaint over quality.
            "
"105","Advertised as a G930V (verizon) what was actually delivered was a 930U... no Wi-Fi calling, no voicemail notifications (have to dial *86 to find out if you have a voicemail)
            "
"106","Great phone everything's okay except the biggest issue is I have AT&T and does not work well because it's a Verizon phone so many of the features like receiving texts and pictures does not work if it's not completely compatible with other carriers
            "
"107","Was not notified that the device was rooted, the whole reason why I was sticking to Samsung is to use the Samsung pass and pay, did not even bother inquiring about having full functionality on the Samsung.
            "
"108","So far this has been the best phone that I have owned. I like that you can use a stand to charge it instead of plugging in the USB wire.  This is a CDMA compatible phone that works with Verizon. Since I use another ISP I wish that I could get rid of the Verizon bloatware.
            "
"109","Came on time. Came in prime condition. - The phone itself is absolutely excellent. I began using it every day, it even has made my life at work far easier. It counts my steps with Samsung Health, and is helping me to stay healthier. Great choice. Great smart phone!
            "
"110","battery life was just like my samsung 3. froze a few times within the first week. product was returned. however, company worked well with us and we'd use them again.

"111","I bought this phone about a week ago and so far, I have been very impressed with it. It came rather fast and sooner than expected. When I took the phone out of the box, it looked brand new with no scratches or obvious imperfections. The phone started right up and the screen looked perfect. Overall, I'm very impressed with this phone and would greatly consider buying another phone from ths company in the future.
            "
"112","Tried to activate my phone with Verizon but it turns out that the device was on a list of lost or stolen phones and therefore was not eligible to be activated. In the few minutes that I did have the phone on and running the battery become increasingly hot.

"113","This phone gets the job done and is danged thought too! I am in the army and this baby has been through the ringer. It survived Fort Benning humidity and Fort Bliss sand!
            "
"114","My company purchased a phone that had the operating system crash upon start-up. It was returned and requested a replacement. Well, the replacement starts up just fine with the Verizon logo and all but when I tried to activate, it's not compatible. Since this is a business account, I was able to get the rep to directly get with IT and they said this device, although showing verizon, is not a phone supported by the network. I will not make any assumptions why but something is not right. Rating: F

"115","Phone works great and was a great upgrade from my completely broken s6. No scratches, dents, etc. Looks brand new. I just wish it had come with a Samsung charger as well.  The one it came with takes forever to charge and is just a cheapy. Great deal overall!!
            "
"116","After 1 month of use, it kept stating that simcard not found. I changed the simcard as well as the simcard tray but phone did not recognize the Simcard. Never dropped the phone. The phones condition is just like new like how I bought it. It's a hassle and pain !
            "
"117","Refurbished and battery had a overheating problem.  I found out after that refurbished phones do have this issue a lot.
            "
"118","My wife needed to upgrade her S6, but did not want or need the latest and greatest.  This was the perfect solution, and half the price that Verizon wanted charge.  It was easy setup and transfer from her old phone.  We are happy!
            "
"119","You drop it once you're screwed. It's all glass so it's not worth it.
            "
"120","Says it is Verizon phone (originally) I took it to a verizon store to activate it and transfer my # and they couldnt get it working. They ended up buying the phone from me and giving me a deal on a galaxy s8 plus.
            "
"121","Phone is great except it came with a bad battery. The battery only lasts for a few hours of light intermittent use after a full overnight charge.Update: the seller covered the cost of replacing the battery. Due to the good customer service I have changed my rating.
            "
"122","I bought the phone in September of 2018 for $230 and it worked fine until a week ago (May 2019). I had it in a locker at work, and at the end of the day when I went to use it there was a little blue light in the upper left corner. Nothing I do gets me beyond another light blue screen that tries to reboot it before shutting off... I'd seriously reconsider making another purchase from this company without buying a warranty of some kind.
            "
"123","Says its refurbished and the phone software says it's in perfect health but the thing can't even answer a call without jamming up. I can literally type an entire sentence and wait 15 seconds for the letters to appear. Garbage.
            "
"124","Arrived quickly and exactly as promised.  Works well!
            "
"125","Our second mistake.  We purchased this phone after making things mistake once before.  We purchased from another amazon seller hoping for a more successful experience.  Again, the phone came with an AT&T symbol on the back.  Uh oh. This phone was more dinged up and in worse condition than the first phone we purchased. We took the phone to a Verizon store to put on our plan.  It didn't work.  The phone will not work on a Verizon line.  They tried to help us sincerely, but to no success.
            "
"126","Phone was as advertised.  Phone connected to verizon network without any issues.  Did have an issue with charger and battery which Kiss immediately rectified.  I would buy again from them.
            "
"127","Fantastic Battery life, works exactly as needed. Definitely worth the price of not getting the newest galaxy for 3 times the price. Only issue is it appears to run slower then my last phone (Galaxy s5) but not by a frustrating amountBe prepared for endless updates when first starting the phone
            "
"128","There is something wrong with the phone, it doesn't always charge, and it when it does it doesnt always go to fast charging mode, other than that its a nice phone but i wish to have it fixed. I am definitely willing to give it a higher rate if the company can reach to me and fix it.
            "
"129","Extreme screen burn in you can clearly see someone left the phone on Facebook you can actually read stuff on the screen minor scratches and crack on finger print reader also received wrong color
            "
"130","Like this phone! Looks brand new. All functions and battery life are great. Was initially concerned with buying a refurbished phone, I couldn't be happier. Mine came from Cell Surfers for a very reasonable price.
            "
"131","I went from a S4 to this S7.  Shipped and arrived exactly as promised.  In perfect condition.  I shopped aroun, and the price was not to be beat.  I've now had it for a few weeks, and I have not one complaint.  Recommend the phone and the seller.
            "
"132","The phone i bought had some issues with it, but once I got a new one sent to me it had all the issues fixed. May be best to go with a different phone rather than struggle with the issues I had too. (Battery drain quickly, late shipping, low quality screen - burned in images)The new one works fine but the process was a struggle.Something to keep in mind is that the phone likely won't have a warranty on it from Samsung so good luck!
            "
"133","Product arrived in great condition. Some scuff marks around the micro USB port, but they were almost unnoticible. Other than that its looks like a brand new phone.I upgraded from a note 3, so I did have to change my sim card to a smaller format, so if your replacing an older phone just something to be aware of. Verizon changed my sim card for free, so wasn't an issue.At first felt tiny compared to the note 3, but I adjusted in few days. I am happy with my purchase.
            "
"134","the phone won't turn on straight out of the package, it goes to galaxy s7 when attached to  a charger and at no other time, then cuts back off. don't know who to talk too, because I removed the back to check if any parts were missing and the back plate cracked during removal, not sure if I can still return it or not. Not even sure who I should direct my questions too.
            "
"135","Cute phone, but the battery dies really quickly, even when I'm not using it and there aren't any apps open
            "
"136","Been using this phone for over a year now and it works great. When i first got it there was some deep scratches on the home button but other than that one cosmetic flaw everything works great and ive had no issues!!!
            "
"137","WeDeliverWireless - phone came damaged there are small cracks in the screen and the area where you plug it in to charge has most of the paint around it scratched off, when I purchased this phone before it was from SikkSound did a great job, the phone came in a flawless conditionEDIT: The phone no longer works due to ""moisture detected"" and is unable to charge
            "
"138","Big improvement over older Samsung phones. Refurbished or not it works and looks new.
            "
"139","I have bought several phones (new and refurbished) via Amazon and never had one so bad. Phone becomes extrememly warm when used or just charging, software is slow, boot up and set up don't even look like actual Verizon software.  Oh and it came in a small white box inside the amazon box, which was not secured with no cushioning so by the time I got the package the white box was open and the phone just out in the amazon box.
            "
"140","Arived faster than expected, in pristine condition. There was no sim caddy ejection tool, but a paper clip works just as well. This phone cam with factory released firmare and had to go through a dozen update cycles one after the other to get up to oreo with the december security release, so be patient and keep applying the updates, it is NOT in an infinite loop.
            "
"141","Wow, phone was perfect.  For the money it was great, looks good as new and all is AOK!
            "
"142","Present for the wife.  After a small learning curve, she is enjoying itShipping was fast and easy!
            "
"143","Love Samsung Galaxy. My S8 Galaxy shattered. So I bought this S7 and then wisely purchased a heavy duty Otterbox and a Square trade warranty. Couldn't be happier.
            "
"144","I totally forgot that it was refurbished. This phone has been as good as brand new since I received it.
            "
"145","Cell works great like my old one. No issues with transferring all my apps and info into it. Thanks.
            "
"146","WiFi on the phone stopped working TWO days after the warranty ended and CR Land refused to help us by replacing the defective phone.  TWO measly days after the warranty was over... Something clearly was defective and not properly refurbished with this phone and yet the seller did not wish to help us, forcing us to buy another phone from a company that stands by their products.
            "
"147","The banner says I purchased this . However I returned it because the micro usb charging slot held the usb loosely so did not charge consistently in the car or any situation that moved. Wireless charging was ok but I did not want to rely soley on wireless charging. Otherwise, the phone itself worked fine.
            "
"148","Looks and functions like new, at a fraction of the cost from Verizon.  And I don't see any issues with the battery life either.  My colleagues who seem inclined to empty their wallets for the sheer joy of spending on gadgets have sheepishly started asking me for the Amazon link for this.
            "
"149","I was a bit aprehensive ordering a refurbished phone sight unseen but I have to say it was everything described and a bit more.
            "
"150","The phone is just ok. Feels, like an amateur phone. I had more features on my galaxy5 and the screen was bigger. When I got it it needed so many updates that it took up alot of space.  Not happy with it. I wish I could return it. Acts weird.  No more refurbished for me!!!!
            "
"151","I ordered a G930v, planning to possibly unlock it, but when it arrived I was pleasantly suprised to find it was actually a G930u, so unlocking was completely unnecessary. Bonus! Although the phone is refurbished, it seems good as new. My only gripe is the lack of an IR blaster, so I'll be keeping my s6 around to control those odd devices I don't have the remote for (laserdisc, CED, vcr)
            "
"152","(This is my second S7 I have owned) Phone looks good, battery charges, stays cool, but doesn't seem to have the longevity as my other s7 phone. The charge cable appeared to be a Samsung OEM, charger was Not OEM, but quick charge capable. Got a chuckle with my ""return information card"" was for How to return my refurb Apple device and the steps to remove personal information.
            "
"153","Had to return at my cost for $12.50. Phone rebooted constantly. No trouble shooting would correct problem. Research suggest its operating system hardware problem. Maybe cannot be detected on standard precertified protocol checks. Vendor accepted return but I had to pay postage. Got replacement phone from same vendor but used Prime this time. Very satisfied with new phone. .
            "
"154","I love my phone, and use it with TracFone. We did have some trouble getting a charging cable that worked properly but the company has great customer service and sent me an extra one for the hassle at no cost
            "
"155","I just got back from the Verizon store and had them tell me the phone wasn't unlocked for them. The load in screen is for AT&T, and it has AT&T bloat ware on it. I dont think anyone even turned my phone on to test if it was a Verizon phone. The battery life is also ridiculously bad and dies in 4 hours of use. I'm about to try and send this phone back, hopefully they work with me. Do not risk buying from them.
            "
"156","I haven¡¯t had to use tech support yet, but the phone has been great! No signs of damage. A tiny bit of wear around the charging port but that it all. The battery has a great amount of life left in it. I can easily go a whole day with vigorous use and still have power left.
            "
"157","First time I charged the phone, it felt like it was overheating.  Then the next time was worse.  I returned it for full credit.
            "
"158","I don¡¯t think Amazon actually checks these out. I¡¯ve ordered two of these refurbished S7¡¯s and both of them had fatal flaws. One of them the camera was completely burned out and the other the battery wouldn¡¯t charge at all. The Galaxy S7 is a pretty good phone, I just wish I could get one that actually worked.

"159","Phone was in good condition, sim card wouldn't read the Verizon card so it was useless

"161","Received a bad battery. The top of screen was cracked. Very disappointed that these are the standards allowed on amazon.
            "
"162","Bought 2 for my wife and I. We're with MetroPCS and I switched the sim card into this phone and followed the instructions that came on a card with the phones. It didn't work at first, so I went to the MetroPCS store and they sold me 2 new sim cards and they both started working just fine. Called to activate and they both work great. These were Verizon branded phones, so we had to disable some built in software, but no big deal.
            "
"163","The phone showed up in good condition very slight signs of wear, I think the whole refurbished thing might be a bit of a joke but it does carry a good guarantee  and is an easy return to Amazon if you are not satisfied. The battery on mine was a little week unfortunately but it will do
            "
"164","Both phones showed up on time and have been excellent. The extra shatter proof glass they provided for free was a nice bonus
            "
"165","Was unable to pull in a signal, most likely due to a problem with antenna in the phone. Phone still had time remaining on its original warranty,  so Verizon sent me a replacement phone.

"167","exactly what we were after works perfectly

            "
"176","Charging area is scratched up, Facebook app image is burnt into the screen, It looks like they tried to pull the back of the phone off. It works, and that's what I needed, but I'm going to toss it and buy a new phone the moment I'm able to since this one is in such poor condition.
            "
"177","Received the phone,  looks good, but when went to activate it, i was informed by verizon that the phone wasn't paid off by the previous owner, is on a nonpay list,  and can't be activated it.I have contacted the seller, and will update when I hear back from them.

"184","Pros: Phone came well packaged and in perfect condition. Works great in terms of functionality, not disappointed in the Samsung S series yet.Cons: Battery life very bad. Gets hot when downloading, loses 10-15% of battery in an hour under normal use...e.g. calling, whatsapp, some browsing. Thinking of returning.
            "
"185","I like this phone very much. However the refurbished model I bought has a short battery life, does not get me through a day. Also, the phone was sitting in my car no one touching it and I look down and suddenly it had a crack across the front screen. :/ :(

"190","Bought Samsung Galaxy S7 Verizon version, received an AT&T compatible phone.  That is very disappointing.  Was advised by Amazon rep to buy different version of Samsung Galaxy since same issue could be consistent with other Samsung Galaxy S7 Verizon.  So I got a Samsung Galaxy S6 Verizon

"193","I've had this phone for ~5 months now and the battery is definitely showing its age (day 1, default setting- overnight- ie not using it all: 13% drain over 12 hours. As of this writing, 27% drain over 12 hours).  But other than that, everything was in perfect condition.
            "

"195","The phone is absolutely stupendous. I had no complaints with it. However, after the 3 month warranty from DealFisher was up, not even a week afterwards, the phone turned off while I was asleep, the phone on the charger, and never turned on again. It only heats up when plugged into the charger. Right after the warranty was up... Meh. Very disappointed in this.
            "
"196","I specifically looked for a phone that said Verizon in the description. Photo shows phone saying Verizon on back.Yet, I get the phone and it says nothing on the back and it is all AT&T apps.So not impressed.I am the third person this has happened to and I am sure in a couple months we will see yet another review just like it!:(((((

"199","So far so good.  Phone seems to work well.Battery seems to be very warm after little usage.  Disappointed there were stickers on the back and the SIM card key was not included but that is the risk with refurbished.  Phone appearance is perfect otherwise so far.

"200","this reconditioned phone has scratches on the screen and surface and the battery was not new, drained after 6 hours.

They works just as good as a new phone and we have had no issues. I have had this phone for 2 months and have dropped it multiple times and it still works perfect. Definately glad I took a chance on buying these phone. I love it!

"206","I purchased this phone for my daughter. It came in great condition with no blemishes or scratches and it started right up. We took it to Verizon and in a matter of moments had a new sim card and she was up and running. So far so good.
            "
"207","Was not clear that you wont get all tools needed to install sim card and mirco card. Also not loaded up like phone you get from verizon. Phone itself works great but need to load up some features that come with the one that you buy from Verizon

"209","Good used police
            "
"210","The phone was awesome. But it's rooted, and the one I got was rooted incorrectly so the microphone would only work on speaker phone. So as a phone it was useless.  This might have been a one time thing, but if you buy the phone and have this problem you're going to have to return it.
            "
"211","I received the wrong product.  You will not refund my credit card for the amount it was charged, along with the points I used, as well as my gift card.  I already paid my credit card. so now I am without the cash, as well as my amazon points and the balance of my Gift card.

"213","the description says it's a Verizon phone, but the one I received was AT&T and would not work at Verizon. They told me that after I went to get it set up at my closest Verizon store, so I had to pay return shipping, and am now waiting for a refund, and need to begin the search for an actual Verizon compatible phone all over again!
            "
"214","Most of the phone was in new condition, however the metal bezel around the rear camera, the glass in front of the flash, and the home button were all scratched. So far works well.
            "
"215","Purchased phone at the end of February it is now July the 19th. Phone began to have charging and battery consumption issues even though I ensured  third party apps weren't running.  As of today my phones screen will not display anything even though the phone buttons are lit.  I now have a 250 dollar paperweight.  I am not happy and will never buy another refurbished phone.
            "
"216","Phone came in good condition. Has a crack on the bottom part of the back camera. But that doesn't affect the phone at all and it doesn't affect the water resistancy on the camera. So far I'm pretty happy with it. But I'll need time to adjust to the size and button placement  differences. (Previously  had a moto g6)

"222","My phone started giving me problems right before the warranty ran out. I sent it in and they fixed it. However, once I got the phone back, there was a brand new problem which they refused to fix because by that time my warranty had run out.

"229","Been using it for about 4 months first month it wanted to update 10+  times a day I guess it caught up with where it needed to be. Overall it's a working phone
            "
"230","Works like new!
            "
"231","Love it.  Looks and works like new.  Has good battery life.
            "
"232","Not that impressed. My last phone was a much less expensive Motorola and worked much better.
            "
"233","I am revising an earlier 1 star review to 3. I thought there was glue residue near the charging port but it's just all scratched up by the previous owner putting charging cable in carelessly. I'm a little disappointed but ok due to the good price on the phone and really fast shipment.
            "
"234","great phone
            "
"235","I love this phone! I could not be happier with it! The camera is great, it charges fast, and is durable enough to stand up to my two year old
            "
"236","As soon as we bought it, the phone instantly heated up super hot. The battery does not last long at all. The fingerprint only works half the time. The screen will freeze occasionally.
            "
"237","Si funciona no era nuevo
            "
"238","Very happy with the upgrades from Samsung 6
            "
"239","Works great, but it came with some rather large scuff marks on it that don't come off. Just would have been nice to know what to expect in that regard. The charger that came with it is garbage but I've always owned androids so I had others to use instead.
            "
"240","Bought certified refurbished S7.  Battery life out of the box is terrible. Standby battery life was 8 hours in normal mode.  Power Saving mode was a little better, but still not good enough to be any way equivalent to a new phone.  Phone is supposed to have 12 days of standby time and 27 hours of usage time.
            "
"241","The phone came as advertised and on time.
            "
"242","This phone looks nice, but mine was not Verizon, as noted in the description. It was At&t, so it didn't work.
            "
"243","Phone was bought to replace my galaxy s5.  So far, so good. The only concern is the embedded battery, which is fine for now.
            "
"244","Great phone for the money.
            "
"245","I love the phone I think the battery life is short but I think is for some of my configuration but in conclusion excellent phone and in the time expected ^_^
            "
"246","So Far So Good, the wife loves it!
            "
"247","Everything is working as expected. Looked perfect when it arrived.
            "
"248","Small dent in upper right corner. Samsung S7
            "
"249","This phone looks brand new for being refurbished. Love it
            "
"250","This phone although not being up to date is a great phone. The battery life is long and the phone functions impeccably.
            "
"251","It's a really nice phone, same size as the Galaxy S5. Both in length and width. It works as if it's brand New! My only issue with it, is that it can die fast at times. Or it gets way to hot. Otherwise it's perfect.
            "
"252","Bought for my 11 y.o. son. He was able to operate it straight out of the box and has had no issues since.
            "
"253","Works great.
            "
"254","Very bad cell reception I went back to using my S5 I don't know why I get way better cell reception with my S5 if I'm using the same cell phone company
            "
"255","The phone was not as presented.  The phone was locked to T-Mobile and the Verizon shop could not configure it for use on the verizon network even though the title of the product has Verizon Gold Platinum and the description states that it will be unlocked and ready to use.
            "
"256","The phone works pretty good. The screen is starting to glitch. Only had it activated one day and it started to glitch.
            "
"257","Decided to try reconditioned phone. Turn out to be excellent choice. Very hard to tell it isn't new. Highly recommend.
            "
"258","I bought a ""certified"" Samsung S& from Sikksound for $327.00. After 3 months, the battery swelled and rendered the phone unuseable. Sikksound did not offer a replacement or a refund even though the device was defective. The were completely unhelpful.
            "
"259","It looks and works like a new phone.  Much better than spending $1000.00 for a new phone.
            "
"260","Verizon tech could not get the phone to activate, tried 2 new sims. In the return-exchange process now.
            "
"261","Ran hot
            "
"262","I am so disappointed. Well just mad. Amazon should be ashamed to sale this garbage.  I purchased this phone to replace my phone. I took it into version and it will not read the SIM card. He told me it definitely is not a Verizon phone. I was so mad I just trained it in for a new phone.
            "
"263","Looks and works like new.  Love it.  2 generations behind saves big bucks!!
            "
"264","will buy from seller again , great phone , done correctly
            "
"265","I like it because it's easy to use.
            "
"266","I can only say that I felt robbed on this purchase when I took this phone in to get a SIM card from Verizon I was informed that the IMEI number was flagged, it was either stolen or the account was being held for non-payment. Subsequently the following IMEI number cannot be connected.
            "
"267","Battery was bad so much for a refurbished unit......would only last 2- 21/2 hrs....luv the phone.....but the supplier is not so good. I received the phone today....3 hrs charging and the setup with verizon.....I am trying another unit from a different supplier......we shall see
            "
"268","Phone worked great, but the screen had a lot is small blemishes on it.
            "
"269","The ""certified refurbish"" policy indicates ""no visible blemishes from 12 inches away""  I guess no paint on the home button doesn't qualify.  All else works fine.
            "
"270","Dislike, AC charger that comes with it does not work well, takes about 4 to 6 hours to charge unlike a factory samsung charger which only takes a little over an hour.Likes, screen resolution and photo quality.
            "
"271","Love it, works well, I'm pleased. Arrived on time.
            "
"272","Love this! Great phone and great price and the color hold is alright! No problems with it so far and no scratches.
            "
"273","It's an s7.  Works a lot better than the s5 it replaced.  I use it constantly and it stays charged all day.
            "
"274","We got the phone and inserted a verizon sim card since it was ""unlocked"" according to the description. It is not unlocked!! This was a gift and a huge disappointment. Waste of time and money. Will be returning today!
            "
"275","Upon taking this phone out of the box, the screen would not swipe. Troubleshooting absolutely did not work. A total waste of money!!!
            "
"276","Discovered that the phone won't receive voice messages after it was to late to return it. Verizon technical support can't figure out the problem. Will never buy refurbished again!
            "
"277","Cell was sold under false pretense. Was not free and clear for new usuage. Was still under a Verizon paid contract. Request imei number of future purchases and check first.
            "
"278","The phone has terrible burn-in pixels on every screen. Without a replacement I would never recommend this to anyone.
            "
"279","Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter & she is super disappointed, as am I, to find that the phone is not as described in the ad. It only works on AT&T. Not sure how this was mixed up - especially since it has the AT&T logo on the back. :(
            "
"280","I bought 2 of these, both had horrible battery life. Didn't realize just how bad it was until I replaced the first one with a new one. Just by new!
            "
"281","Was not as described!!! Phone is not unlocked!!! I have called the company over 3 times and they never answer or return my call after leaving several voicemails!!!
            "
"282","The phone seems to be as good as new. I love it!!
            "
"283","Nice phone for the price ! Battery seems a little burnt out . Works for straight talk and wasn¡¯t locked !
            "
"284","Good phone
            "
"285","Despite receiving the phone with cracks in the top left corner, the phone was operational. Would have returned if her other phone had not stopped working. Feel like I paid too much for a cracked phone.
            "
"286","Feels like a brand new Galaxy S7 even though it is refurbished.
            "
"287","When I opened this I instantly saw the missing back cover, but when I tried to turn it in the screen wouldn't work (by screen I mean the screen itself turning on so I could see what I was doing). The touch screen was still working though.
            "
"288","This refurbished phone is like new!  Also, I really like the phone!  I've had for a few months and it hasn't failed yet. :)
            "
"289","The S6 I had was bad all around, but I love the S7.
            "
"290","Bought this at a great price and it came as promised. Looks new, no defects, battery charger works great as well. This seller is fantastic.
            "
"291","Ordered a verizon phone,but got a sprint one. The CAPs botton on typing pad was not working.
            "
"292","Love it!
            "
"293","Love the phone. Recieved on time
            "
"294","My wife loves her Samsung Galaxy S7 cell phone.  It has all the features that she required in a phone.  The price was fair and the shipping was very fast.
            "
"295","Very good, sturdy product and more than expected. I recommend!
            "
"296","Couldn't use the phone at all because it can't recognize a sim card
            "
"297","Better than the s7 Edge.  At least you can find a protective case that works on this one.  With the edge...the edge is unprotected and it broke when I dropped it on the edge
            "
"298","OK
            "
"299","Love this phone. I switched from apple and I'm a Samsung person now. The phone works great- no problems at all. I bought my husband one shortly after I got mine, and they are excellent phones. Very happy!!
            "
"300","Love my phone.. It looks brand new. Arrived on time. Just hate the battery doesn't last long
            "
"301","Phone was sent from Deal Fisher and was not a Verizon phone as advertised. Verizon will not activate unlocked phones which it turned out to be. Had to return it after not being able to get a sim card from Verizon!
            "
"302","Battery life is kinda bad. Has some scratches on the corners and a big scratch on the fingerprint sensor. But overall works good and the camera too.
            "
"303","Perfect! All good!
            "
"304","Everything I need it to do.
            "
"305","Appears new, came with genuine Samsung Fast Charger. Arrived when expected. Beautiful and fast. Really like Nougat. Saved a ton of money.
            "
"306","Very disappointed with this phone. Battery life is very poor. I doubt this phone will make in more than a month.
            "
"307","Microphone doesn't work. When I researched, I found that is a common problem.
            "
"308","Awesome as good as new.
            "
"309","Only had the phone for a few weeks, but so far I like it! No issues yet.  Looked like new when I received it!
            "
"310","I give this phone no stars. My boyfriend couldn¡¯t connect his phone to Verizon because it was on Verizon¡¯s blacklist as a stolen phone. Now his line is disconnected and we have to get a hold of amazon to get a refund and he doesn¡¯t have a phone! Ugh.
            "
"311","It came before the actual due date, which that was great! Unfortunately when I activated the phone, it would constantly restart itself. Tried rebooting it. Still was restarting, the firm ware is damaged.
            "
"312","Lightning fast, great camera.
            "
"313","It works.
            "
"314","The phone I received worked almost perfectly and was in very good shape. There was an issue with the fingerprint scanner which I've yet to fix (if it can even be fixed), but that's the only issue I've come upon. Otherwise, it's fully functional and more than worth the price.
            "
"315","Got this phone two days ago and its already messing up. All my apps crash, phone freezes quite often and disables the touch screen. Battery life also sucks. Tried restarting or checking for updates even reinstalling apps and still having issues. I would not advise anyone to purchase this. Also came in late. SKIP!
            "
"316","Bought this phone MAY 18...it is now August 1st...the Phone no longer works, you can open the screen but cannot get to the homepage.  They do not offer warranty so there goes $200+ right in the trash.
            "
"317","The charging port did not function well upon arrival. I have to literally hold the charger in the charger port with force to charge. This product is not functional since I cannot charge. DO NOT PURCHASE
            "
"318","Bought as a present for my sister she no longer annoys me
            "
"319","Product came looking like new. Everything seems to be working wonderfully. Verizon had no issues when I went to have them set it up. I'm loving the Samsung S7!
            "
"320","I Love it
            "
"321","Great phones. Both worked Great!
            "
"322","Fantastic buy!
            "
"323","Definitely not worth it. Have problems with apps working and have to restart several times daily. Freezes up often and does not get as good of service as a carrier provided phone in identical model. Recommend buying used and local.
            "
"324","This phone is not unlocked! It is only allowing Verizon sim cards not any other carrier.
            "
"325","This phone is TERRIBLE. It's supposed to be an amazing phone but it's not. After going through quite a few off brand phones I decided to go as generic as possible and buy a Samsung Galaxy S7. I went with a refurbished one because it was cheaper and was supposed to be like new. And it comes unlocked so I can use it abroad where I am studying. I get me phone and first the data won't work. I try for an hour and then all of a sudden half the screen goes blank. It just won't work. So now I have a broken phone with only half a screen. This phone is crap and I would never recommend anyone get this. This is what I call horrible customer service!!
            "
"326","My Samsung 7 arrived defective. The speaker is busted, nothing but static noise. Very disappointed
            "
"327","Works exactly as advertised
            "
"328","Love my new Galaxy S7 but most of all I love the camera in the quality of pictures it takes and that's the reason I bought it the shipping was fast got it in 2 days with no problems easy to set up with no problems
            "
"329","Pretty good product. However I have a problem with voice message because it is set by former carrier by default so I cant access to this service.
            "
"330","After I let it sit and charge for a little while, the phone has worked PERFECT after. After a close ans detailed inspection, there is absolutely no damage anywhere. The phone is fast, sleek, and is just like a brand new phone.
            "
"331","Great condition!
            "
"332","Arrived right on time, looks like brand new and working great
            "
"333","It is like brand new !
            "
"334","I received the phone. It would not charge, and ran really slow. Very disappointed.
            "
"335","This phone is not worth the money. Battery dies quickly. Have to charge 2 or 3 times a day. Have an Otter box case and the screen cracked the 1st time I dropped it. I wish I bought new. This phone is junk!
            "
"336","Samsung Galaxy S7 is a great phone! Not the latest galaxy by any means, but much better than the s4 I replaced it with.
            "
"337","Great phones for a great price....very pleased with arriving neatly packaged and looking like brand new phones...seem to be working out very well for us for very reasonable price! Many thanks to seller Dealfisher!
            "
"338","Wrote an email requesting a return label for this item as it is defective and never heard back. No phone number listed. This phone does not charge and I want to be refunded!
            "
"339","Phone operates great and everything runs smoothly. But the battery on this phone sucks. Will die in a few hours if I'm using it. This is a used phone so maybe there all not like this one. And it overheats.
            "
"340","Phone is a technical marvel. So far the only issue with it is the battery life.  Literally  see the battery  drain by the minute. Maybe since it's refurbished the battery is older than expected.  Don't Know.
            "
"341","I bought this phone in july, the phone is overheating and the battery doesn¡¯t work!
            "
"342","The phone was perfect in every way except for the batter life. The charge doesnt last very long. Overall I'm happy with the phone.
            "
"343","This was a great buy i really needed a new phone. Going to look forward to buying for this company again!!
            "
"344","Cool
            "
"345","Great phone and great price.
            "
"346","Arrived as promised, was in excellent condition; came with charger.  This phone works great and was easy to activate with a Verizon Sim Card
            "
"347","Item came as described with prompt delivery. Purchased a sim card and it was activated without any problems.
            "
"348","Arrived in time.  Activated without issue. Audio sounds tinny compared with working unit not refurbished.  Good price.
            "
"349","Perfect
            "
"350","The phone arrived in perfect condition.  I am so glad I bought it.  My very first smartphone.  I knew that the battery would need to be replaced.
            "
"351","Normal
            "
"352","After just 2 or 3 days the back button on the bottom right of the phone has all but stopped working for me.
            "
"353","Excited with my device excellent conditions all functional and a very good attention by the seller dealfisher I recommend your products
            "
"354","Very happy with my purchase. Speedy delivery. No hitches with start up. Everything worked as expected. Friendly personnel at Kiss Electronics and easy to deal with.
            "
"355","Good condition works perfectly.
            "
"356","Do not buy this phone from tech venture they are not Verizon phones and can¡¯t be activated.... such a waste of time
            "
"357","No qualms with the seller, but the phone is trash. The camera lens cracked like 2 months after purchase.
            "
"358","Works as advertised. Very satisfied. Looks like others have had problems that I have not experienced. Maybe some phones are like some cars. Lemons.
            "
"359","Phone was not compatible with Verizon system.  Had to return the phone.  False representation.
            "
"360","I have the international version of the S7 for a non-Verizon line and it works fine. I tried this Verizon version of the phone for a Verizon line and it had a problem unlocking from the home screen. Three times it just wouldn't unlock and I had to do a complete system wipe and reboot. I picked up a second Verizon version of the phone from a big box store and after a few days of use it too became stuck in an endless loop when I tried to unlock it. I am starting to think the Verizon version of this phone has some issue with unlocking.
            "
"361","The phone came in good condition for use as an AT&T phone, we took it to a Verizon store.  As we expected, the phone will not work on a Verizon line.  Big loss!
            "
"362","It's much, much better than an S6 (which is the worst of the range).It isn't as good as the S8 from what I've heard.All in all, if you want a good phone then you'll get one with this
            "
"363","This is the most worth it phone out right now.
            "
"364","Phone is performing as expected after two months. It looked like new and was timely delivered.
            "
"365","Ordered a phone. When the package arrived all the box had in it was a generic phone charger.
            "
"366","Works with MetroPCS, UI is snappy, Connection is just as good as when I had my S5, and the camera quality should be taken full advantage of.
            "
"367","Bought this as a prepaid for Verizon, setup and activation was simple and the phone works as intended.
            "
"368","so far it seems like a brand new phone, great quality
            "
"369","Muy buena grasias
            "
"370","Bought this phone in the description that says it was an unlocked phone turned it on starter to use it would not let me use it because it says it is Verizon Wireless only
            "
"371","Sleek look and runs well, but the front camera sucks. Rear camera only works well in good lighting.
            "
"372","It came as advertised, quick shipping, no scratches or dents.  It's the smartphone I've wanted for a long time.  I've used Samsung for a few years, and I was thrilled to be able to keep my current service and upgrade to this phone.  The resolution is great, and the 12 mp camera is getting a lot of use.  Best phone I've ever owned!
            "
"373","Phone is perfect nothing was wrong with it's !! LOOKS NEW !!!!
            "
"374","Message and email notifications don't work. The phone keeps downloading an update, but won't complete the install, bad buy.
            "
"375","Love my new phone
            "
"376","I bought this phone since I broke my ipad badly. The phone looks like brand new works very well but the battery life is not that good. However, overall, i really satisfied with this.
            "
"377","Terrible should've never bought this piece of junk. It's done nothing but glitch since I got it. Never buying a refurbished phone again.
            "
"378","Everything is working well and my transfer of data and sim card was easy from my Galaxy S6.
            "
"379","I purchased this phone in June and its now Oct 7th and was determined by a repair shop unrepairable.  It powered up then shut down every 2 minutes.  don't waste your money on this!
            "
"380","Phone was fine there were scratches all on the corners screen was intact looked good but the finger scanner didn't work so I choose to return.
            "
"381","Grate
            "
"382","Funciona bien y esta como nuevo
            "
"383","This certified, pre-owned phone is in perfect condition.
            "
"384","Product and quality was exactly as advertised. Phone is like new and works perfectly. This is a great option for someone who wants a quality phone but for whom the latest generation ""new"" phone is not a must - have.
            "
"385","Battery is great so far phone looks new. Thanks for the great device at a great price
            "
"386","My phone worked great for about 6 months until 2 days ago it turned off and never turned back on again. So i then had to purchase a new phone due to it breaking out of nowhere
            "
"387","Love this phone!
            "
"388","good product at a great price
            "
"389","Great phones at a great price
            "
"390","Ended up taking phone into Verzion to set up and we were told that even with a verizon sim card, we were not able to use the phone on verizon network.
            "
"391","Great phone for the price at the moment at <$200. Highly recommend for a replacement.
            "
"392","The phone is in good condition but it came with the completely wrong charger cord. Luckily I had a charger from my previous phone that will work. The charger it came with looks like it would work for a iPad?
            "
"393","Phone arrived in its packaged, covered in bubble wrap, with its charger and cable. Other than the most superficial, invisible scratch on this screen, the phone is virtually in perfect condition. Refurbished items are just getting better and better these days.

"394","I could not at all tell this phone is refurbished! Looks brand new and works well. I will most definitely purchase from this seller again!!
            "
"395","Already fully malfunctioning 1 day after opening. Battery life is garbage, screen is glitchy. Ugh. What a waste.
            "
"396","Purchased for my mom and she LOVES this phone. Great buy for the money and no defects.
            "

            "
"401","I love the phone and have absolutely no issues with it.  It meets all of my expectations for a Galaxy S7
            "
"402","The phone arrived on time, works really well so far, and looks like new.  I am very happy with it.  The only problem is that it came with an iPhone charger instead of the correct charger.
            "
"403","I was a bit weary buying a refurbished phone but since amazon prime backed this deal I decided to jump on it. 4 months with the phone , took it under water , and did all the mundane things we do nowadays with the phone and this phone still work as promised .Highly recommended
            "
"404","The performance was as if brand new. The screen had a small dead spot when the brightness was low. I sent it in and got another one from buyspry instead. This one is perfect.
            "
"405","The phone seems to have a problem with the speaker phone and the charger is not compatible with the phone.
            "

"407","The ONLY thing that I didn't like about the phone was that it was NOT COMPATIBLE with my Boost network and it have to be sent back.
            "

"447","This is a really nice product, especially for the price.
            "
"448","Looks and feels like new. Holds charge for a day with normal use. At half the price of new, it's well worth it to buy refurbished in my opinion.

            "
"476","It just that the home button is too far from it's position from that it is good
            "
"477","Was leery of buying given the horror stories of vendors with Amazon.  Happy to report, no problems (yet) after several weeks.  Verizon mailed me a free SIM card (no need to buy one) and I installed a 64 GB ram card along side it for a few more bucks.  Why buy a highly fragile S8 for twice the price when you can get this one?  It came new in the box.  Did not have original charger, other than that just fine.  Might buy another one.
            "
"478","The phone came with a screen that was burned. Worked fine but this isn't what I paid for.
            "
"479","Excelente producto
            "
"480","The early stages of the phone would reboot itself.  After these setbacks, it seems to be running just fine.

"531","i use it every day
            "
"532","This is not a Verizon phone as stated.  Had to return.
            "
"533","While all functions of the phone work as advertised, the battery life of the phone is so poor that it absolutely eclipses every other possible positive quality of this. Im currently getting only 6 hours of battery life worth only one hour of Screen On Time nested within the same time. This means that if i leave my house for drinks at 8pm, my phone will be basically dead by the time bars close and i wont be able to call an uber or even use google maps /maps to walk back to an apt or my house. Every time the screen is on the phone loses more than one percent per minute, even as the battery manager says it has hours left.  I heard great things about the phone and battery life in particular and I know that it may be due to the fact that its refurbished or but its so distracting and such an inconvenience that I dont think it can be honestly used in a day-to-day environment. I have just contacted the company responsible and will amend my review if the issue can be quickly and adequately resolved.
            "
"534","I was very pleased with my purchase
            "

"542","Mala compra
            "
"543","Product was exactly as described in the ad
            "
"544","Phone seemed to work great and was in brand new condition, but like a few other comments on here Verizon wouldn't activate it because whoever previously owned it had an unpaid balance and the device got put on a list. They absolutely won't do anything to activate it until whoever owes the money pays it off.
            "
"545","Phone works and looks just like new
            "
"546","It came by accedent.

"559","LOVE THIS PHONE
            "
"560","Dislike
            "
"561","Proof positive that paying retail prices for a phone is simply stupid. This thing is brand new and it works perfectly. If you're so concerned about having a warranty, pay your phone bill with your Well Fargo Visa card, which offers warranty protection up to $600. That's vastly smarter than buying a retail phone simply to get a warranty you're probably never going to use.
            "
"562","Yeah it looks great...but the battery is completely shot, doesn't even last 2 hours! NOW I have to either return it or have the battery replaced which in a Galaxy S7 isn't exactly easy...I knew this was too good to be true.
            "
"563","Zero stars from me! We purchased this phone that said it was a certified refurbished verizon phone! When I took it to the verizon store to get a sim card and activate the phone, I was informed the phone was a sprint phone! The manager of the store ran some numbers on the back of the phone and inside, the numbers did not match! Very disappointed in this company!
            "
"564","Great Phone . 7 months in and no issues thus far.
            "
"565","It always overheats
            "
"566","I wanted to give it a little time before reviewing this to make sure everything worked properly. I'm about 3 weeks in and everything is great. It came with a charger, in a discreet brown box. The phone itself runs like brand new. At first I was concerned about the quality of a refurbished phone, but those anxieties have been laid to rest and I will certainly buy refurbished in the future to avoid increasing my monthly bill.
            "
"567","Gracia
            "
"568","The phone was still locked my Verizon
            "
"569","Perfect, thank you so much.
            "
"570","Good product fast service
            "
"571","Phone arrived on time with no defects and was easy to hook up to my already existing Verizon account.Only issue was that there is a little tool needed to open the Sim Card tray that normally comes with the phone but was not included here. However, I was able to open the tray myself with a safety pin after a bit of fidgeting so this won't be too much of an issue.
            "
"572","Exactly as described, worked perfectly
            "
"573","All ok! Great!
            "
"574","No problems whatsoever.
            "
"575","Ok
            "
"576","Thanks
            "
"577","It's great phone with more features and possibilities than I need. In great shape, looked pretty much new excepting a couple minor scratches on the back.Biggest beefs are that the battery life is less than expected and it gets crazy hot when using the GPS with the screen on.
            "
"578","Great UI, design, and camera. Unfortunately the top speaker crackles if the volume is turned up too high. I suppose it's part of the risk of buying refurbished electronics.
            "
"579","Fabulous
            "
"580","Phone came in near perfect condition, no scratches on the glass or dents on the metal.  Came with fast charger, headphones, micro usb to usb adapter, and sim card tool.  It's an amazing product and it works great.  The battery lasts me all day for normal use or 6-8 hours of streaming video. I purchased my phone from Edge Cellular.
            "
"581","Bought these for my daughters. Took them to my local Verizon store and got them set up.. my girls are happy and everything seems to be working great..
            "
"582","It was supposed to be a Galaxy S7 but I received an S6 instead.  It still works well enough not what I paid for but its a good item nonetheless
            "
"583","tight phone
            "
"584","Four stars since the first one was very defective out of the box. It would reboot every few minutes. They obviously do not check these phones very thoroughly. They were both in perfect cosmetic shape.  The phone its self is a great phone. Good feel, weight etc. the screen is amazing and the camera is far better than my 5S was in low light. The only negative for me was the removal of the IR emitter. I used that a lot on my 5S.
            "
"585","Received package today.. Opened box to find the charger, the USB and NO PHONE... Extremely disappointed
            "
"586","Works like a charm.  No problems.  Looked like it was brand new. Had to go to Verizon store to get the free sim and activation and no issues there either.
            "
"587","The refurbished Galaxy S7 phone I purchased from BuySPRY looked and performed like new with no cosmetic defects at all. I received the phone 4 days after ordering and the seller sent a follow up email the day after delivery to make sure I was happy. Took it to Verizon the same afternoon I received it and Verizon activated it with no problems. Battery life is great.  It took 22 minutes to download my contacts, pictures, and apps from an older model Galaxy phone. I used quite a lot of Google searches to help me customize the phone the way I wanted. I love this phone. I looked at an S8, but for my needs, the few extra, and much more expensive,  bells and whistles weren't worth it.
            "
"588","My new phone the Samsung 7 model in brushed silver was delivered to me as expected and its shape (used) was great. There was a little wear on the home button and this wear can only be seen in some sideways light; there were no other visible marks or scratches on the phone. I am very pleased and believe I got a bargin.
            "
"589","Same quality at lower price? I thought it is case by case, but I got a bad one. My phone signal getting weaker and weaker and now I cannot receive any call inside of building.
            "
"590","Arrived on time.  Works great. Thanks!

Not only does it get physically hot when charging or when being used for any length of time, the less glitchy, and most recently the speaker that allows other people to actually hear you should you decide to use it as a phone does not work, so my phone is now a very expensive tablet with no phone capabilities. Pretty pissed off
            "
"593","Is this an unlocked phone? I just bought and it doesn't accept my TMobile chip. I'm returning my phone.
            "
"594","Very disappointed in the customer service. Phone battery started failing, and they say the only thing they can do for me is have me ship the phone back to them for a repair. So now if I want the phone fixed I have to go buy another phone otherwise I am a couple weeks without a phone.

"597","This phone was defective. It was certified refurbished,  but clearly was never actually fixed.  I tried using it for about 2 months and it got little to no signal,  was slow, and glitchy. I bought a brsnd new phone of the same model It works great.  I'm sending this one bank,  and never buying from that vendor again.
            "
"598","Very happy with this purchases. We updated from our S5's to these S7's and was very impressed with the quality and new lool including the packaging. Much faster than the S5's and takes very nice photos. Picked up the SIM chips directly from Verizon for only $20.

"603","After getting the runaround at a Cricket store, I was initially told that the phone was still  locked wirh Verizon. However, I did some research on Google and read that all Samsung S7s were actually sold unlocked. Therefore, I took the plunge and opened up my Micro SIM card to the Nano SIM card size (my BLU phone takes the micro SIM card). It acfepted it, but I had to tweak some settings  under the ""Mobile Networks"" setting ad well as change some info in the APN settings. Hence, my steep learning curve this afternoon! <U+0001F602>Long story short,  phone IS unlocked, but u have to do the research as to how to optimize the phone to your carrier's settings. Phone is gorgeous though. I'm happy with it now. Learnt some new stuff today too. Phone had no scratches and it came with a fast wall charger. <U+263A>

"611","This is a great upgrade from my Galaxy S5 - it is SO MUCH faster even with little things like connecting to my bluetooth headset. I was a little hesitant to purchase the Verizon model (G930V) since I am an AT&T customer. I was told in the AT&T store when I had to activate the new sim card that since it's a CDMA device that it would be stuck on the ""H"" (Hospitality) speed network which would not be LTE but would be on 3G speeds. The mobile network will sometimes switch over to H or 3G, but it does stay on 4GLTE most of the time - I'm just using the normal AT&T APN settings. I just tested and got 43Mbps down and 9Mbps up on the mobile network - this is definitely not 3G speed. :) I still need to work through a voicemail issue, though.Also, the device came to me in what appears to be like new condition. There was a small scuff on the top of the phone, but the screen seems pretty much flawless.

"622","Good phone, seems to overheat when charging.
            "
"623","The phone arrived in perfect condition, without any signs of use. I'm really happy about taking this chance so far.I'm knocking off one star because the ""relevant accessory"" wall plug charger it came with does not support Samsung's Fast Charge - it's labeled as supporting 2v at 5A only. The original Samsung charger supports variable voltage/amperage combinations up to 15 watts. It's not a huge deal compared with the savings over buying the phone new or even getting refurbs from Verizon. I ordered a Quickcharge-compatible wall plug by Aukey on Amazon for 15 bucks. It's also possible that other sellers may include a fast charger.

"638","I bought two of these refurbished Galaxy S7's.  I've only had them less than a week.  My wife's appears to be working well, but mine hangs up and needs a system reset several times a day.  This happens when it is idle for a length of time - several hours.  Seems OK if it is on a charger, but if left overnight off the charger it is unresponsive in the morning and needs the system reset.  When it comes on it still had battery life two nights, but the battery was at 0% another night.  Sometimes it hangs up during the day after being idle a few hours, even with a nearly fully charged battery.  Looks like I'll have to send mine back.Also, I have a hard time typing on that touchscreen keyboard - seems I have to backspace once for every 2-3 characters I try to type.  But in fairness, my grandkids seem to have far less difficulty.  Maybe I'll get accustom to it.UPDATE:  The day I wrote that review, I arranged to return the bad phone and buy a new one.  But I did not send it back right away.  That was about a week ago and I haven't experienced the problem since.  The S7 had required a couple system updates - perhaps they fixed the problem.  I've decided to retain the phone since then.  I'll leave the score as is.

"646","I actually bought an unlocked S9 from this group and it works great. Got a 20% off Amazon like one day thing, so it was very cheap and that was why I did it but in thrall of all the hype. BUT, I had to give up my S7 I had gotten from Verizon for about six months to my wife as her old S5 finally bought the dust.I gotta tell you I really loved the S7 having come from an S5 back in August of 2018. Essentially, an S7 is an S5 on steroids with a better OS updated to Oreo in like October 2018 so recent.  The S7 is all about substance over form. The S7 in some ways is the last of the purely functional phones with a hard button. Samsung reached a peak with this phone. They essentially fixed all the ""issues"" they had with the S5 (plastic) and S6 (glitchy not polished ideas) and created a nice looking decent phone with a good camera, water resistance and a fast chip inside.  Ever since, for the S8 and S9 all they did was make em prettier and faster with bells and whistles.  The glass backs on the S8's and 9's are just another thing waiting to break. You better get a good case. They are slick in your hand too. But that screen is nice I must admit, but it is obvious that the new phones are all about form first substance second. It must be prettier and more flashy and oh by the way, it is very fast.But we are talking about the S7 and it is a very good phone for the average user who isn't going to play shooter games and doesn't need the latest, greatest and flashy. The S7 is not slow.  It s a highly functional phone that is water resistant (IP68), pretty darn fast built like a tank (metal), with unconnected fast charging and with a very decent camera. I loved it. I love its size in a hand. It fits perfectly in pockets whereas the S9 is long.  Not a biggie..until you bend over in jeans. And I am not too sure I am totally sold on these curved front glass on the S8's and S9's. I have already cracked one tempered glass screen protector because of the little pretty curved glass front. I never had a problem on my S5 or the S7. Apparently, this is common. The S7 is a little solid brick (still pretty) has a nice solid protective metal bezel and back and with a screen protector is good to go always. I have lately picked the old S7 up off the charger and noticed right away how comfortable it was in my hand remembering it fondly. The S9 is a great phone, but I miss the S7's pure functionality as a practical necessary device that ""fit"" in so many ways.  I may try to see if the significant other will trade me. She does like that Lilac back on the S9...So, I promise you if you are an Android person over 50 and just want a nice functional fast reliable phone that still looks good without a case, go with one of these and save yourself around 500 bucks. You won't regret it.

"647","Bad experience because I had trouble getting the new sim card from Verizon and now the return period expired.
            "
"648","I have owned a lot of phones throughout the years and this is the worst phone I have ever owned, Period ! I have mostly owned Motorola phones up until my nearly new Moto Z Play was accidentally submerged at the lake while putting my new boat in at the dock. At that point I decided I needed a phone that was water proof and this was suggested by a sales person at my local Verizon store. I currently owned a 10"" Galaxy Tablet and it was OK so didn't think twice about buying a Samsung Phone. Well, it was a huge mistake and I noticed almost from the beginning how short the battery life was and also how slow and sluggish the phone seemed to be compared to my Moto Z. At first it was tolerable but it just seemed to get worse, slower and more sluggish and the battery life after only a year is at a point to where I can barley make it through a full day a work and I find my self having to plug the phone in throughout the day just to get by. I did go through some steps on Google to try and speed the phone up and free up resources but this only helped a little and the battery life is just a deal breaker. The other issue is the phone is so damn fragile, I dropped it for the first time the other day, and even in a protective case the back completely shattered. I dropped my preious model Motorola phones countless times and other than a slight mark or blemish the phones were absolutely fine. So after only a little more than a year of use,  I now find myself needing to purchase a new phone due to its less horrible battery life, glass-jaw like build quality and piss poor performance and it will certainly not be another Samsung !!!

"650","This phone locks up (unresponsive) far more than my Galaxy S5 ever did. It seems to do it at the most inconvenient times too like when I am trying to use the camera....the camera is great and I love the features but I could NEVER use the phone as my go to camera for the lag reasons.Or take today, I missed 2 incoming calls (it never even showed incoming) and then when I tried to call VM the phone basically locked up. I was finally able to respond to a text but this thing lags even when typing!Even after I rebooted...which sometimes takes 90 seconds for me to initiate when it gets into lag more, it was slow after the reboot!It's unreal. I think this is my last Galaxy.
            "
"651","It's a solid phone in very excellent condition, and the price was great.It's still pretty tied to Verizon - you have to do quite a bit of manual setup to get it to work properly with other carriers (I had to call T-Mobile to have them reset some settings). I also get some annoying notifications about the SIM card not being from Verizon when I restart the phone.

"652","Sadly bought 2 of these for my early 20something kids for Christmas and one of then dumped the firm wear of the phone out of no where.rendering the phone useless as of  the first of May started using phone in December. So not even six months of use.  It was great while it lasted.

"653","I decided to try something new for a change and purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7. It took me awhile to get used to the new software of an android phone and all the features that the S7 has to offer. I found the S7 to be overly complicated and it took me a lot longer to complete my endeavors with the S7 compared to an iPhone. In addition, I have found my Galaxy S7 has constantly froze and forces me to close applications. In my opinion, I think that iPhone is better than Galaxy because of the simplicity that iPhone offers.

"654","As a phone, I like this. Easy to set up & easy to use. However it came hot out of the box. It heats very easily & I need to recharge several times a day. The charger sent with it only worked for a few days, then began draining the battery. I have a backup Samsung charger & am using that. Not happy with the state of this phone. Will be getting full refund.
            "
"655","When the s7 first got here and I turned it on the start up was completely unrecognizable.  The start up was in a dififferent language and made the phone set up almost impossible.  I was on the verge of sending it back but with google's translation app and the use of another phone to instantly translate the foreign language so I could change the language to english to finish the set up.  I have been in love with her every since. Thanks

"656","The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge have a common defect where the rear camera glass cover will spontaneously shatter. There are quite a few reported cases of this online, and Samsung is as of yet not acknowledging it as a manufacturing defect. Because of the design of the Galaxy S7, it is virtually impossible to repair this yourself, and in order to have it fixed you have to go without a phone for over a week after shipping the phone to Samsung, paying them to repair it, and waiting for them to ship it back. In my case the rear camera glass cover shattered while sitting on my desk, and there are numerous other reports of similar events (as crazy as that sounds). Samsung Support is unhelpful and denies that this issue has been previously reported, despite evidence to the contrary.

"673","I had a Verizon LG G4 on Straight Talk and I loved it. However, it finally succumbed to the dreaded boot loop effect that LG is currently being sued for. I was looking at a V20 from LG but I read that it, too, was part of the class action law suit and as far as a refurbished G6 for about $40 more, well, sorry, LG, but you've pissed me off now.I started looking at alternatives, and it came down to the HTC 10 or a refurbished Samsung Galaxy S7. After much searching and reading reviews, I settled on the S7. There were several vendors offering them, and I went with DealFisher because they had the ""fulfillment by Amazon Warehouse"" label. Amazon is pretty picky, so I figured they'd be held to a higher standard than these other 3rd party vendors. I paid an extra $8 for next-day shipping.Package arrived on time, in a generic box with an aftermarket charger and USB cable. The phone itself was in excellent condition for a refurbished model. There are 3 small, very light scratches on the otherwise flawless glass on the front. I didn't notice them when I first got the phone, so it could be a result of sitting in my pocket with my keys (screen protector is on the way). There are signs of wear on the plastic bezel around the camera lens, and whatever it is that covers the flash and IR sensor (I read it's some kind of polyurethane coating and shows scratches easily but doesn't effect the functionality) has several marks on it. Everything else on the phone looks brand new. I'm using a Supcase case for it and it fits perfectly.As far as the phone itself, I really like it. Fast and smooth, camera is very good, low-light shots are the best I've ever seen on a phone. the screen quality is amazing. I like watching 4K videos on YouTube just so I can bask in the S7's pixel density goodness! It's eye-candy.I like the size, it's not too big and not too small. Bluetooth works well and pairs with my devices just fine. Audio sounds good and is plenty loud enough, in both earphones and speaker. One thing that irked me about the G4 was no native FLAC support. The S7 plays them just fine with no need for a 3rd party paid-for app like Poweramp. UPDATE: Does not play M4A audio files, so back to Poweramp.My G4 had a pretty finicky battery that would rarely get me through the day. The S7 seems to be much better in this regard. Also, the G4's lock screen would randomly come on all the time, and I don't have that issue at all with the S7 (I disabled the Always On Display feature).My G4 never received updates and it irked the crap out of me. I guess it had something to do with being a Verizon phone using a Straight Talk SIM card. One thing I had to do with the S7 was to get a new SIM card, since it uses a NanoSIM, not a MicroSIM. Surprisingly, upon connecting to the Verizon network it showed an update available and now I have Android 7.0 on my new S7.Time will tell just how durable this refurbished model is. If anything goes wrong, I'll update my review.Bottom line: For just over $230, it's a very nice deal for what is still a great phone that doesn't seem dated to me at all. I like it.
            "
"674","If you get what you ordered, this is a really nifty phone.  When I decided to upgrade from my 2.5-year-old Galaxy Core Prime, I researched Samsung's flagships back to the S4, and decided the S7 is where they finally got all the changes right.  Great screen, camera, plenty of memory plus expansion slot, runs android 7, and oodles of options, settings, and customization.  The fingerprint unlock is a nice feature.  To me, this phone is also the perfect size, and will still fit in a normal pocket.Only cons so far: finding a screen protector that fits may be difficult, and the notification LED is smaller and dimmer than I am used to, making it hard to notice from a distance.It took me two tries to get the proper phone, however.  There are numerous third-party vendors all selling under this same product description, and I surmise there may be some tension as to what counts as a ""refurbished"" item.  The product description seems to indicate minor defects are acceptable.  Amazon's definition seems to indicate it should be repaired, cleaned, and essentially remanufactured to original, like-new specs.  Now, I have purchased refurbished on Amazon before with great results: A couple Samsung WiFi cams that were as good as new, and a DSLR, refurbished by Nikon USA itself, that was stunningly immaculate.  Alas, the first phone I received did not meet that standard, and was more what I would consider used but decently well taken care of (light glass scratches, dirt/corrosion in speaker and microphone ports).  It was also the wrong model, G930U instead of V, and had an ESN that Verizon could not recognize and activate.  No SIM card for me!  That last bit, of course, was the deal-breaker.Luckily, I had selected an Amazon-fulfilled item, so return and refund was of course fast and painless.  I repurchased from a different seller, also Amazon-fulfilled, and the only one who could deliver before the weekend.  I then timely received a pristine S7 that truly exemplifies what I would call refurbished or remanufactured, and am most pleased.  The short extra wait to get it totally right was well worth it.
            "
"675","I've purchased two ""used"" Samsung S-7 phones and both work just fine. This one was no different. No issues, no problems, just put in your information, add a sim card from an old phone and all is good. Of course you have to add your own personal apps and such but all in all it's a great way to save money. If you buy from Verizon, they will charge you $25-30/month for 2 years and you are obligated to continue paying or face a penalty if you cancel the contract or damage your phone. My wife dropped her phone and it was cheaper to buy a used phone than repair her old one. Verizon refused to drop (no pun intended) the charges on her old phone so we are still paying for it and this new one. My advice to everyone is buy your phone outright and you will save the equivalent of $12-15/month over a 24 month period......added up, that's $288-$360 savings......better than a sharp poke in the eye.

"677","The Samsung S7 is great! After my Note 5 took a bath and quit..I replaced with Samsung J7 both are great phones and very similar with the exception of the cameras.  The J7 while nice, didn't have the camera as the Note 5.I opted to try a refurbished Samsung S7. You would never know it wasn't brand new.  For less than $270 I've got a flagship handset, with an incredible camera and expandable storage. I highly recommend expandable storage if you enjoy taking pictures and loading mp3 files.I often drop my phone and rougher than most...so I couldn't justify the cost of an S8 or the newer S9 model phone. I'm very happy with the S7 and glad I took a chance on a refurbished item.

"680","I give the product 5 stars, but the delivery was all over the place.  It finally arrived a couple of days late.  Who knows what happened, but the package arrived in excellent condition, so the extra routing did it no harm.  The Cell phone is like brand new.  It is a beautiful phone and my wife loves it.  In fact, after a few days of use, we like it so much I ordered one for myself.  AND GUESS WHAT?  It to has gotten lose in route, can you believe it?  I keep getting apologies for the lateness and when I track it it seems to be zigging and zagging its way to my address.  Never had this problem before when ordering PRIME from Amazon, weird.  I do not mind it come days late if it is in the same condition as the phone my wife received.  I would buy it again.  I liked the S8 and S9 but the roll over screen appears to be too sensitive for me.  My kids have these and you cannot pick it up without setting something off.  This S7 can be bought in the EDGE model but I prefer the standard screen.  The fact it is water proof (? resistant) and dust proof is a plus.UPDATE:  I liked this phone so much I ordered on for myself.  And guess what?  It too seemed to have gotten lost en-route.  When I did received it the packaging was fine, just a late delivery.  Also, I had assumed this was a Factory Refurbished, like the one I bought for my wife, but it came in a different product package and without the Refurb. stickers.  The phone looks like new but has a warning on the inside saying that it only has a 60 day return warranty, as opposed to the 90 day warranty of the Cert. Refurb. models?  So far the phone is working flawless and is like new -- I would guess it is actually a new phone, except it came with a Nokia charge cable, and a small transformer charger that is not from Samsung.  I have found a flaw, the headphone plug is crap.  You have to hold the plug in with pressure or it will not work.  For me?  I don't care about that because I never use headphones.  Everything else looks like new.  I have marked my calendar for the 60 trial, because that is what it is, for me.  Both of these phones came through Amazon Prime and say the supplier is Samsung, so I am assuming they both came from the same distributor, but the difference in packaging says otherwise?  We will see.
            "
"681","Despite the phone being refurbished, the phone looked brand new, though the packaging wasn't original.  A charger was included with the phone.  I had no problems at all with the phone's performance or battery life.  It was nice having a home button which is an actual physical button.  The back and background buttons are also on the bezel beside the home button.  On the minus side, by far the biggest problem was that the phone design wasn't that convenient - the lack of a bezel on the sides meant that I was accidentally touching the screen and activating things far too often.  I solved this mostly by getting a case (which I was going to get anyway for additional impact protection).  I also thought the security features were a little too strict and the fingerprint reader was useable but did not always recognize my finger.  Be sure to be thorough when having the fingerprint reader read your finger for the first time!  Not much else was included with the phone besides the charger, but I was already familiar with Android phones, so ithis was minor at worst (and there's always Google!).  There's nothing marking the back and background buttons' position, but if you're already familiar with the layout of the Android screen, this is easy to deduce and thus also a minor point.Bottom line, if you want a fairly modern smartphone that's good enough and doesn't have to be bleeding edge in terms of tech (and cost!), this is a good choice.  Special shout out to BuySPRY, for their quick turnaround (quicker than Amazon regular!) and delivery of a high quality product!Update 8/6/2018:  A couple of issues arose with the phone.  1) the phone had extra apps, presumably from the previous owner.  Nothing terrible, but one of the apps was spouting annoying ads.  Luckily the ads had the standard ellipses which gave the option of purchasing the Pro version of the offending app, so I was able to remove the app (and the ads).  2) the S7 requires a special SIM card that Samsung phones no longer use, so be prepared to do some searching for an available SIM card, if you don't have one already.  3) Be prepared to download lots and lots of security updates to get the phone up to speed.  I guess it's still better than having your phone orphaned, though.

"682","I wanted to wait at least a month or two of owning this phone before I wrote a review.  We are at that point in time and I am glad to report that I am happy with my purchase.  The phone I received look brand new. Not a scratch or blemish.  Thank you for that!  I brought it to the Verizon store and they helped me get it activated.  I did have some problems doing so on my own but I am going to chalk that up to the user.  If you have problems doing the same - don't despair and head on down to your local store.In the two months of using the phone, I have not experienced any problems.  The battery lasts about 24 hours on a charge.As well, my experience with the seller has been a great one.  I had been sent a question by another purchaser and answered that the phone came as described and looked brand new but the charger didn't work.  Which was a non-issue to me.  The seller immediately contacted me and sent me a replacement charger that worked.  I appreciate the customer service, especially when I was not looking for the help.  It will have me come back in the future for additional purchases.
            "
"683","Works as spec.  Battery life is as new. Updated immediately to Android 7.0 when first started.  I just plugged in my sim card from my old Galaxy  S7 Edge (I prefer the S7 by the way) - et voila!
            "
"684","The phone looks perfect. It came with an off brand charger that does not seem to charge it, but that is not a big deal to me, as I have chargers that do work.  This did not come with ear buds either, which is also not a big deal to me but may be for someone else.  It took a full week to get delivered which took way to long.  Amazon has rarely taken that long.  Once I finally received this phone, I did the smart switch from my Samsung s5 to this s7. That was easy and worked perfectly.  I got everything set up and it all worked great.  So I finally switched my sim card and ready to make calls.  That's when everyone I talked to on the phone said they had a hard time hearing me.  They can't hear during the call unless I use the speaker phone.  Since it's not always feasible or appropriate to be on speaker this is a huge issue. Calling Amazon tech support I was told to install any updates or reset the phone to factory settings.  Neither of those things worked.  With regret, I will have to find another option.
            "
"685","Keep in mind that I only got the phone today so this review doesnt cover long term issues.Condition: It looks new and has no damage what so ever. Now it might not have the shine or feel of a new phone, but I put it under strong light looking for any signs of damage and I found none. Touch screen is perfect and all the buttons work. I'm a little worried that the home button might fail in time (it does feel a little weird) but for now its responsive so no complaints. The phone also has a Verizon logo at the back.Packaging and delivery: I dont have prime. I ordered this on Monday afternoon and I got it on Saturday. Not bad. The shipping box had the protective air bubbles and all. The phone does NOT come with the original packaging. As the case with most refurbished products it comes in a generic box. It had a changer and a short USB cable but no headphones (bummer). It also doesnt have the user manual but who reads that.The phone takes a nano sim and I micro SD. I had to replace my sim at the Verizon store and they added me to the network no problem. I'm not sure if this phone works with other networks but it does have setup guide for non-Verizon carrier. The battery doesnt seem as bad as some reviews are saying, but then again I've had my S5 for almost 3 years so anything will feel like an upgrade.
            "
"686","Got this phone today, and it works fine with my Verizon SIM card from my old phone.It didn't copy over all my contacts, and no pics or files, which the set up wizard said it would.  Ah well.I have my most important contacts and apps manually loaded onto this phone.Battery was at 66% on receipt, so I charged it once set up was done.Size is a bit smaller than my old S7 Edge, but is okay.Now with this phone working on my Verizon account, I can do the surgery on my old phone to replace the bad battery.  Being in poor health and homebound, I need a working phone with online capability at all times.  This new-to-me S7 fills the bill.So far I am pleased.It works with the Verizon nano SIM card, and setup was fairly easy.  Seller is listed as ""Wireless2GO"".
            "
"687","The screen has lots of minor abrasions which make it extremely prone to retaining many fingerprints and oils. The earpiece is all scratched up (the black paint is chipping off of it a lot), and the home button has a big chunk taken out of the middle of it.  The corners are also pretty dinged up and the charging port is filthy as though it wasn't ever cleaned out with alcohol as it should have been - I cleaned the charging port myself when the phone failed to charge at first.  Cleaning it did the trick.  The power button is finicky and doesn't always function on the first press.  The microphone and speaker holes are also somewhat dirty right out of the box.  The phone still functions just fine aside from these points, however, and it seems to still have its waterproof properties.  The SIM card tray is perfectly intact as it should be, and there are no scratches in front of any of the cameras, luckily.  The last owner of this phone certainly didn't go out of their way to keep it clean or take care of it with a protective case or even a screen protector.  Adding a screen protector does help with the scratches that are all over the screen, at least.  You get what you pay for I guess, but I am mostly happy with the phone so far simply because it is surely an upgrade from the S6 that I had before this.
            "
"688","Ordered one.  Dead fingerprint sensor.  No hassles in returning.  Got another, worked  three days, then the wifi disabled and would not reenable.  No hassles in returning.  Could just be bad luck.  Bought an used IPhone and gave up on used Android phones.
            "
"689","I have never purchased a used or refurbished phone before and had heard horror stories from friends and family. But after doing my research on the seller and with the backing of Amazon, I decided to take a chance. The phone arrived 2 days earlier than expected. Was in great condition - only 1 small scratch near the home button. I took it my local Verizon store and was up and running in a matter of minutes. Updated to the most recent Android system and away we go. Batter life seems comparable to previous smart phones. I've had no technical issues so far.  I've always been a fan of the Samsung Galaxy family of phones so this is no surprise. My review is more of a testament to the seller, BuySPRY, for exceeding my expectations and proving to me that you can still get a good value on a used product!

"690","I have been a Blackberry person for over 20 years. One of my first cell phones was a Blackberry. My husband checked me for a temperature when I ordered this Samsung Galaxy S7. So, I LOVE IT!!!! I have had very little trouble getting use to the the new icons. The phone works so similar to my Samsung Tablet that I really did not have any trouble converting. Phone was in excellent, like new shape and ported right over to my Verizon plan. I had to do a couple hours of download on OS updates about a week after I began using it, but went to Verizon store and used their data, saving mine for my stuff.  The size is excellent for me to carry. The features are clear and easy to use. The price was GREAT!! Delivery was as stated. Totally satisfied!
            "
"691","Great experiences with a great product.I have ordered 3 for my family over the past year and have had a great purchase, delivery, and performance experience with each.The price is fair for what I have found to be completely reconditioned from an appearance perspective and functionality perspective. Each time the phone was delivered within two to three days; the most recent was delivered early during the Christmas shopping season. It is not fair to compare my old phone to this one but I will say that the phone works as expected, is very fast, has good battery life, and never overheats.There were no issues with setup at the Verizon store.I would recommend this to a friend  .... in fact, I did just that today.
            "
"692","Bought this one from ireplay, very good item, bought two cell phones actually, my Daughter needed a replacement & do did her Daughter ( grand daughter got an LG.).Seemed my Daughters complaint was built in ads and my issue was sale's tax, given the company had no local presence, understand that will change either a new Amazon warehouse going in locally next year; but for now it's a bogus charge & more than local tax charges.I always appreciated Anazon holding out on taxation, then policy changed. It's still easy to find sellers that don't charge out of State tax  though.The phone has proved a worthy buy, however.
            "
"693","Caveat: I got this as an upgrade from my first phone, which was old and not the best quality to start with. So I might be a little off perspective about some things.That said, I love this thing. Migrating my information and accounts was really easy, as was dropping the stuff I didn't want. The keyboard is much more precise than my old one. It is much easier to read the screen than my old one, especially for extended periods (I like ebooks). The screen adjusts to ambient light conditions, which is a great. The screens are pretty self-explanatory, and the icons are easy to see. I am still working out some of the differences with services between this and my old one (which wasn't a Samsung), and I don't like any of the default ringtones, but overall I love it!
            "
"694","I had to return the Phone due to it not working. Upon putting the sim card in the phone, it was capable of sending and receiving text messages. It was able to make outgoing calls. But no matter what settings were changed, it would not accept phone calls. Any and all incoming calls were sent directly to voicemail every time. I even visited the local verizon store to have them assist with this. We tried everything including placing the sim card in another phone to verify that it wasn't the problem. Tried a new sim card. Literally everything. There is something wrong with this phone. Probably the reason it was turned in to be refurbished in the first place. Seller does not even provide a shipping label for return...
            "
"695","Amazing phone! Had the iPhone 6 this is better hands down. Awaiting the nogut 7.0 release from Verizon. Get a 128gb SD card and this phone becomes more useful than most computers/laptops
            "
"696","I wish I had pictures, but you can't take pictures of your phone with your phone. It was like Christmas...boxed up beautifully with the new, wrapped cord and charger. Almost like a set of new earrings or jewelry on display. The little access key to make it easier to get into the phone was gummed gently to the inside of the lid, obviously to be seen for use by the purchaser. It was so nice that I can't make myself throw the orange box away. (I have a thing about saving the boxes phones come in. Mental, I know.) Thank you, CPRTX! You really treated me very well.
            "
"697","Took a Verizon contract store 2 hrs of attempting their automated SIM registration process, once they called tech support it only took another 5 min. Wife really likes it. She isn't challenging any of the performance boundaries, but it does everything she asks without hesitation. This was an upgrade from a S5, which had been getting slower. Did not want to pay $800 for newest, and the wife did not want to re-learn a phone (like my moto) so another Galaxy seemed to fit. So at 2/5 the price and 4/5 performance I got a ""new"" fancy phone that will make the wife happy
            "
"698","Both my wife and I got S7 edges when they first came out.  She dropped hers a couple times and both the screen and the back just shattered.Found this refurbished S7 & got a Lifeproof case and it has survived so far.  Battery is a little weak, but that seems to be the case in my experience with most refurbished phones.We are huge fans of the Samsung Galaxy line, this is like or 3rd or 4th one in a row.  The design is sleek and the software is very user friendly.As with most Galaxy phones, the camera is one of the top selling points, and the S7 does not disappoint.  Nice camera and editing and filtering options.
            "
"699","It looked like a good deal until I tried to get it to connect to Verizon,  come to find out is wasn't a Verizon phone,  had to send it back (I paid shipping),  bought a brand new one on eBay cheaper, no tax,  that one was defective, had to finally send it back,  I am using my old S5, bought a new case, makes me think it is new,  oh well i had a black cloud flying over me that week.
            "
"700","I've had this for about 1 month now and it's working fine. I didn't want to spend $900 on a brand new phone that can get cracked or stolen easily. I figure that at thr price of this S7, I could buy 3 for the price of 1 new phone. I decided to save my money and go for this one. Next year, if I'm tired of my S7, I can ""upgrade"" to an S8 which will look and feel like a ""new"" phone and still have saved myself around $300.PS - I accidently dropped this in the bathtub last week, but pulled it out quickly, dried it with a towel and then put it in a ziplock bag filled with rice - and it's still going strong!
            "
"701","Glad I did this. This model has a waterproof feature that I need, I've gone through a few S6's because of water damage. Used WIFI for data transfer and it worked great. Same User screens same Lock screen all of it. I backed everything up anyway but didn't need to. Battery life is far better than the S6. Camera resolution is smaller but I cant tell the difference. This was a good purchase for me and I like this phone's extra features. BTW, I used all my S6 accessories on the S7, not quite the same size but worked anyway.
            "
"702","I ordered two of these certified refurbished  phones. One was great: in really good shape and worked perfectly, the othe one same shape but the microphone  didn't  work. We have sent it back for a replacement. It has not arrived yet so we don't  know  if  there are any problems with it.
            "
"703","Came in practically perfect condition.  If you looked really hard you could see some minimal use on the screen but otherwise it was in perfect working order.  I was a little hesitant about buying a used phone online, but I'm glad I did!  I've used it for about a week and haven't had any problems.  Definitely worth paying only a fraction of the price for a very nice phone.  I would highly recommend!
            "
"704","FAST SERVICE PHONE IS JUST LIKE NEW WITHOUT THE HUGE COST NO SCRATCHES DENTS OR MARKS VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE
            "
"705","I purchased this phone as a replacement for my daughter who was away at college.  After she got the phone connected we found that you could hardly talk to her and understand her.  The phone would repeat your voice back with delay and tons of static.  Unfortunately before we could send it back for a replacement, she slipped in a puddle, fell on it and broke the screen.  She hates the phone and now we are looking to find another one.  I'm not too excited about buying another phone off Amazon given my experience and the reviews I'm reading.  Looks like many people are having trouble with phones bought off Amazon.
            "
"706","I was a little concerned about buying a refurbished cell phone but decided to take a chance. It looked new out of the box and has been working like new as well. There seems to be a wide range of reviews on these phones. I think it depends on who you buy them from. The issue I have when reading reviews is that is the one thing nobody mentions in most cases. Mine was purchased from BuySPRY. It has been an excellent phone so far and I am glad I went with a refurbished phone now.
            "
"707","Was disappointed to get a phone with something so basic as having the screen coming apart was a gross error. I'm OK with ""refurbished"", but not defective. Home button loose. Likely from the screen issue. The rest of it looked beautiful and worked.
            "
"708","I ordered from Electronic deals. The first one received, wouldn't connect when I put in the SIM card. Contacted the seller, and they were great. Sent back the cell with the overnight postage covered by them.  Recieved another soon after.  Works great! Love it. Battery isn't as good as I hoped,  but better than my old one and charges fast with the fast charger I have. Just bought wireless charger and can't wait to recieved it! Highly recommend the seller electronic deals!
            "
"709","I'm giving 5 stars. The product is exactly what it was described to be. It works awesome. I've had no issues this far with one exception. Phone kept prompting to have software update. I tried to update from phone several times with no success so instead I used my pc which as long as it works then that's all that matters. The phone came in 2 days early which was awesome! I have purchased several phones online and this is by far one of the better ones.
            "
"710","The phone  looks great at first sight. But even after just using it for a day or two I notice the battery  loses power crazy fast. I'll definitely  be keeping an eye out on this issue before the return window closes. Everything  else about  the phone is great. Came with a turbo charger and works pretty good. Only issue is with the battery.
            "
"711","While a used phone, I could not tell.  It looked new to me.  It arrived in a Samsung box with a charger and USB cable.  Comes with a 90 day warranty.  Most phones Ive seen for private sale were in poor condition and wanting more money.I was so pleasantly surprised that Verizon provided such a quality product for a great price.
            "
"712","I had a rewarding experience with this purchase. I would recommend it. My order came as describe and for the price .I had a great deal. The phone was in a great shipping package and shipment was really fast. Thank you so much and will recommend you to family and friends.
            "
"713","I have had this phone since August and had excellent performance with no problems at all. I haven't gotten is wet so for it being waterproof  I cannot say but my old non-waterproof phone never got close to water either.It came in plain undamaged packaging with not a scratch on the phone anywhere, just like brand new.
            "
"714","That I can use my waterproof fit bit with it.  That it keeps updating every day, sometimes even twice in a day.  This is my first smart phone and I am finding it hard to learn all it can do.  Call me a tech dummy!  I hope that by the time I really need to use it for something that I can do it.
            "
"715","Received this phone. Had it turned on, transferred everything from Verizon--now the bad part. It won't hold a decent charge. Not even for one day! Either it was fried in its previous life or the battery is bad. Returning it to Amazon.
            "
"716","Love it.  Had an S5 but was having battery and display issues.  This was a nice upgrade.  I don't need all the bells and whistles of the latest models and the price for this was certainly right.  I have bought refurbished phones before with no issues and there certainly have been none with this one.  The SIM card is a different size so I couldn't just swap in the one from my S5, but I got one for free from Verizon (took some convincing, however, Verizon store personnel didn't seem to know that they were allowed to give me one without the phone in hand).
            "
"717","So far so good. The phone looked brand new and it came with a Samsung charger and cable. So far battery life is very good. I'll report back if it degrades. I bought this phone to replace a brand new 16 month old Motorola Z Droid because the battery only lasts about 2 hours even with nothing running. If this phone from Kanga Supply works out I may never buy another new phone.
            "
"718","Went to Verizon for some troubleshooting and was told this device belong to another account. Even after taking the box I got it with, was told they couldn't help me. Had to buy another phone.
            "
"719","Battery dies quickly, there are functions on the phone that don't work, apps that the previous owner possessed still on the phone, I should have bought new.
            "
"720","I¡¯m so upset. I waited almost 2 weeks for this phone and when it came I brought it to the Verizon store to switch my service over. They told me that it doesn¡¯t read the SIM card. I spent hours trying to figure it out. Now I got to wait another 2 weeks to ¡°possibly¡± get one that works. Hopefully they will reach out and help me out
            "
"721","I love this phone! I bought a refurbished phone and it works great for the money.This phone is a bit more narrow than the edge model if you want a bigger phoneI would recommend the Samsung S7 edge.
            "
"722","So far looks good. Still trying to get all the stuff off my old S6. This phone only came with a non-Samsung charger and cord. No tool to open the Sim slot but I had the tool from my S6. Looks slightly smaller than my S6 but the screen is the same size. S6 has no added memory slot so I am looking forward to the 64gb memory card to load up pictures and music and not have to keep deleting stuff.
            "
"723","The phone works very well. I love the camera and the photo editing features. The blue light reduction feature is great as well. The touch screen can be slow and sometimes the words that came up while typing can be very off, but overall I really like my new phone.
            "
"724","Purchased this because the description states: ""Samsung Galaxy S7 G930v 32GB Verizon Wireless"". Verizon could NOT activate this phone because it is not a Verizon phone. Phone came in a box with only the charger and phone. Outside on the box it states ""Samsung galaxy s7 g930 32g Verizon/unlocked black"".  Returning for a full refund.

"725","My son's Galaxy S7 screen went dead the last time he dropped it. We bought the same phone from this company and we stuck in his SIM card and SD card and its worked like a dream. Its a certified refurbished but looks and acts like brand new. It was fast shipping too! Thanks!!
            "
"726","The phone was as described, refurbished in good condition. We transferred a SIM card and had no problem activating the phone on our Verizon account. The seller provided warranty and contact information In the box. My son is very pleased with his new phone.
            "
"727","Could see only one tiny scratch. Otherwise, the phone looks brand new. Battery life is so-so, but that might just be from adding apps and playing with the phone. In typical Samsung fashion, the screen is very sensitive to touch. Annoying, but not a big deal. I added a screen protector that seemed to help.  I've only had the phone for a couple of weeks, but hopefully I'll continue to be happy with my purchase.
            "
"728","Perfect condition. Shipped with charging cord only. No manual or headphones. Works great with our Verizon service. So far so good!
            "
"729","I bought this to replace my wife's ailing previous samsung s5 (I think). Everything went fine other than it repeatedly asked to update system software something like 8 times in the first week of ownership. I was honestly worried that we got a dud BUT everything since then has been perfect. she loves the phone. we received our order on time
            "
"730","I like the phone, however I have had the screen freeze on me 3 times now. The first time a Verizon rep help me reset the phone. I have reset the phone myself the other 2 times. It took me multiple times to get it to let me in. I am worried this will keep happening. What should I do?
            "
"731","I was amazed by this phone. It cane in perfect condition,  not a scratch or blemish on it. Easy to set up, battery works great.  I would definitely recommend Dealfisher to anyone.
            "
"732","Wow. What a nice upgrade from an S5.  The camera is amazing, and really big improvement in low light conditions.Highly recomend if looking for a new android phone. Just right size.
            "
"733","For the price this phone is awesome. Replaced my S5 that had become a complete mess. This phone is fast, long battery life and no visible wear. Also came with a real fast charger and an adapter so I could easily connect phones and transfer all my info over. Love it so far!
            "
"734","After reading the negative reviews mixed with some positive ones, I figured it would be a gamble purchasing this refurbished phone. Well, I lost that wager. Phone went from 100% battery to 34% in 2 hours, with very limited use. Tried removing unnecessary apps, dimming the screen, and turning off the ""always on"" screen setting, but nothing helped. Ended up just purchasing a new phone from Verizon.

"735","had a faulty charger but had it replaced with no problems

"737","The Galaxy S7 is STILL an amazing phone - even two years after it's initial release. I bought this phone solely for the purpose of capturing 1080p and 4K video with the Osmo Mobile 2 that allows me to walk while recording and get extremely stable footage.
            "
"738","This phone does not receive 4G.  It barely receives 3G where I am located and my previous S5 received 4G just fine.Took it to Amazon and they tried and tried and gave up.  Am returning it.

"740","Works as good as the original we bought through the VZW retailer so far (4 months). Had to call verizon and have them re-add visual voicemail because the phone didn't automatically sync when we had it synced with the old phone number (from the phone it replaced.)
            "
"741","I purchased this phone on 04/05/2018 and received it the next day, shipping was great. However the phone i received died after a day and a half of use, after spending hours on the charger it will now not turn on. I am very displeased with this product and would like a replacement sent immediately or my money back as it is still within the 90 day warranty.
            "
"742","I received mine from DealFisher a few months ago. The battery seems to hold up well and everything has been in good working order. The home button is likely aftermarket and a little ""clickier"" than it would be from a new phone, and the fingerprint scanner isn't quite as consistent with it  as I'd expect (less so than it was with my S6). Overall it was very much worth it to buy refurbished.
            "
"743","I've only had the phone for a week but so far so good. Purchased a sim card from cricket, followed instructions on their site for bring your own phone to put in all necessary codes and I'm good to go! Loving all the features of this phone!
            "
"744","Sold by Kanga Supply. Works great and looks good. Battery is holding up well.
            "
"745","I bought the S7 refurbished to replace an older cell phone of mine. Prior to this purchase, I had only purchased new cell phones directly from Verizon, so I was nervous. Well, the phone worked so well and was so easy to set up that I came back and purchased a second one for another family member. The first one shipped from BuySRRY and the second one from Kiss Electronics, but it did not make a difference as both were identical, quality products.
            "
"746","It's holding up okay so far. Brought it to a Verizon shop and got it set up easily. Two complaints about the S7: the charge port still sucks (cords don't fit/ break and probs with moisture getting in) and no memory card.
            "
"747","Phone is in great cosmetic shape however it gets really hot and doesn¡¯t hold a charge well. If a battery is this poor, you would think it would be replaced as part of the refurbishment.
            "
"748","This is one of the best Samsung phones to date. I have had multiple galaxy phones over the years and this was a jump from the S5 to the S7. Multiple screen ability, great battery life, wireless charging and ease of use make it my favorite phone so far.
            "
"749","This was a terriffic deal (at 40% of new list price). I was initially hesitant but after reading the quarentees and return policies I purchased this S7. After 2 months use, I am both very much surprised and extreemly satifiied with the great quality and performance of this refurbished model.  I won't hesitate to buy such items hereafter. Again, Great Buy!!
            "
"750","Been using this for awhile and have no regrets getting the refurbished. LESS than half the cost of a Verizon replacement and has worked flawlessly for quite awhile.
            "
"751","I received this phone as an upgrade to my old Samsung S5.  I am so pleased with the build and quality of this phone - it has all the features I need plus more that I don't.  ;)  I mainly use it for texting and checking my social media.  Camera has some great features and pictures are great.  I'm super happy I have this new phone!  For being a re-conditioned phone there was not a mark on it - it looks brand new.
            "
"752","This Is An Amazing Phone And By Far My Favorite And I Love It But It Is Not Waterproof Like It Is Said To Be. I Have Gotten It Wet So Many Times On Accident And On Purpose But One Time It Got Wet Accidentally ( With A Life Proof Case On ) And My Phone Wouldn't Charge And Was Glitching For 2 Days And Now I Cant Use My Bottom Buttons. It Sucks Because The Warranty Does Not Cover Water Damage. I Highly Recommend This Phone But I Also Highly Recommend Not Getting It Wet.
            "
"753","only issue I have had is when plugging in charge cord tells me to unplug moisture detected so I got a wireless charging pad and works great problem solved....
            "
"754","I could not be happier with this product.  It was the perfect replacement for a phone that I really liked but accidently destroyed.  It was delivered quickly and I had no problem quickly and easily transferring from my old phone to this one. It is continues to consistently perform very well.
            "
"755","Fully charged the phone prior to use. Less than 4 hours later phone was down to 15%. Eighth continued use seems to be losing 20% every hour on the optimized battery setting.The phone took 4 updates in order to work properly.  I'm not sure if that is common but I've not experienced it with other refurbished phones.
            "
"756","The phone was exactly as described, maybe even better. There wasn't a scratch anywhere. The phone has been working with no issues not for more than 2 weeks.
            "
"757","This phone is absolutely amazing. It is everything you could ask for in a phone. But it will only work if you have a Verizon Sim card. It doesn't work with any other carrier.
            "
"758","Much better than my Galaxy Core Prime faster, better pics. Ilike it and I got a refurb. at $350.00  It has been reliable , looks like new. I like it.
            "
"759","So far it is perfect and I could not be happier. Works like brand new. And is a great phone.
            "
"760","Very happy with the phone at this point for what i payed for it. The battery life does suck but not a bad phone over all.
            "
"761","works well and I love the gold color.

"762","phone is very good and working like new.

            "
"764","phone gets hot just being on. the phone i received has keyboard ghosting burn marks on the lcd screen that is permanent. the phone only lasted 10 months. Now I phone does not charge at all on any kind of charger.
            "
"765","received 3 different phones before the one I have right now, they have great, easy, and fast customer service, everything went fine with a few replacements. convinced the phone doesn't have a oem battery, it discharges very quick.
            "
"766","For me I love this size phone, Goldy Locks...just right. Best Sam phone in the last 5 years, bar none. Battery life could be better but it meets my needs.
            "
"767","Rec'd samsung s7 ...refurbished. .everything so far seems fine with the exception of speaker phone. Big disappointment. ..have had it less than 30 days so can't speak to the longevity yet. 3 stars only b\cuz of speakerphone.

"768","Great phone! Upgraded from a S3 so it was very appreciated by my teenage son. No problem using it w/ Ting.
            "
"769","I will literally spend 7 hours of my day trying to get my phone to 100%. I then use my phone for 30 minutes and I'm already back down to 40%. Total crap.
            "
"770","My son had broken his Moto Play 2 so he bought this phone from Amazon.  We popped the SIM card in and it has worked quite well!It also came quickly!
            "
"771","I don't buy referbs often but this one worked well.  Everything works.  No visible marks.  No issues connecting it to Verizon.  My son has been using it since mid-December with no issues.
            "
"772","I loved the phone but it didn't make it a year before I had too spend to fix it. I've been having issues since including overheating to the point it burns. avoid the seller.
            "
"773","Phone failed to function after 5 months of use. Phone started just shutting off on its own to the point it would only stay on for a few seconds at a time. Called Amazon and not much they could do since the phone was out of warranty. So much for paying extra for a certified refurbished.
            "
"774","My flip phone  husband  loves his  phone ! easy to use and like  mine  so I can help him.
            "
"775","Phone appeared to be like new, and everything seems to be fine except when I went to the Verizon store to get a new sim card it was pretty balky at connecting with the network. We had to do a factory reset at one point, after that it seemed to go well. Other than that I've had no issues with it so far and like I said it looked like new, no scratches or anything like that, so happy with it.
            "
"776","Perfect working order. Minus a small blemish on the back of the phone, which doesn't effect its operation in any way, this product is flawless.
            "
"777","Plugged in my Verizon sim card and started right up. Looked like new. No problems so far.
            "
"778","Battery life on this phone isn't even close to 80% of original. Constantly having to charge it with light use.
            "
"779","Excellent, have no problem recommending , packaging , delivery , product were excellent.
            "
"780","I like the phone, good battery, quick to charge, my only issue is that the screen that was put into this refurbished device has screen burn in.
            "
"781","So fare so good!  I'll report back after a year if I have any problems.
            "
"782","When a cell phone fails, turns into a paperweight, and you need another quickly. The phone came in less than two days, needed a firmware update, but otherwise looks and acts new, so far. I certainly hope that the durability proves to be good as well.
            "
"783","Looks and works like new. Has a low battery life. Not sellers fault, just samsungs, wish i could change the battery easily.
            "
"784","The phone's as expected but the experience was surprisingly pleasant. No complaints here.
            "
"785","Worked fine on the Verizon network after I installed my Sim card.  Also it appeared to be in perfect condition with no scratches or blemishes.
            "
"786","Scratched to pieces on screen and the back as well as the charger port and I think something is wrong with the port....
            "
"787","Arrived 3 days sooner than anticipated and worked directly out of the box with Verizon.  Only had to swap cards.  Thanks!
            "
"788","The phone has a replacement screen... it's slow to swipe; the battery gets really hot in a short use. basically garbage and I""m not out of the country and can't do anything :(
            "
"789","Received a G930U instead of the G930v advertised.  Was able to make it work, but not what I wanted.
            "
"790","After checking several times and verified that I was ordering a Verizon network phone, it arrives and is AT&T. Completely useless to me now.
            "
"791","Been using for almost a year, no complaints! Came wiped clean and ready to go. I'll never buy a new phone again!
            "
"792","case had scratches on it and no manual and only a 3 month warranty. Too expensive for a refurburbished Item
            "
"793","Totally as expected.  No complaints.  Good job Samsung.
            "
"794","Great phone. Looks great. No cosmetic damage. The battery seems weaker than a new battery though.

"796","Good deal, solid refurb

            "
"801","The phone itself is great, minus getting glass in my fingers due to the shattered glass back that the phone arrived with
            "
"802","They offer a T-mobile starter kit to come with it that doesn't work. Waste of time. Don't order unless you have verizon, but even then these reviews dont look great, so dont bother
            "
"803","Want to be able to switch carriers att T-Mobile etc.  this is no a good phone for that. The CDMA setting does not work on other networks.  Good mostly on Verizon.  Don¡¯t buy to switch to anyone else. Unlocked does not matter

"812","Product as described.  No scrathces or signs of previous use.  Packaged well and with assessories.  Performing well.
            "
"813","The phone arrived in perfect condition and works beautifully. I  purchased this as a replacement for my phone that had been stolen. There are no differences between this refurbished phone and the one that I had purchased new.
            "
"814","This phone's battery is terrible at holding a charge.  And I picked this phone for the picture quality ..... which is also terrible.  My droid takes better pictures.  I wrote the seller and did not hear back.

"861","I was hesitant to order a refurbished phone but I was pleasantly surprised! The phone looks brand new! No flaws what so ever! I've only had it for a week but so far, no complaints!! Everything seems to be working properly, I am very happy I took the risk and went for the ""half price"" refurbished one!If this review has helped you in any way, please click the YES button. Thank you.Update: I've been using the phone for 5 months or so and I'm still loving it. It's pretty much like my friend's who bought it new, the only difference is the screen. His screen is original and is fingerprint resistant, he only has to clean it about once a week. Mine on the other side must be cleaned about 10 times a day with alcohol or some other cleaning agent. It is super difficult to clean, and  is impossible to keep it clean. I started using a stylus on it, made no difference. That thing is a fingerprint magnet!!I do wish they used a better quality glass for the screen when they refurbished it!
            "

"912","I bought this to replace my ""bricked"" Samsung Galaxy  S3 (sch i535). I have Straight talk and this phone works great with it. All I did was pop the sim card out of the S3 into this S7 and fired it up. I was using a Nano ? sim card in a micro Sim adapter so I just took the nano sim out of the adapter and popped it into the S7. Seems to have awesome battery life so far. It came with a charger cord and wall plug. It looked brand new and had zero marks on it, It came with Android version 6.0.1 . I love it!
            "
"913","this phone does not work with the Verizon network
            "
"914","Shipping took 8 days, not sure if that is normal but definitely a first world problem.  I have used this for two days and so far a 5 star. The first day it had to do updates 7 times before I could use it much. Not sure what version it started with but is now up to 7.0. When I took it into Verizon to get a SIM card they said the serial number says this phone is gold, which it is not, it is black. And when I registered the device with Samsung it also shows a gold phone.Finger print reader is very quick and effective. Samsung pay is great and quick to checkout with.Phone is fast and battery life seems good. I'll update the review in a few days and weeks and let you all know how it is holding up.-------I have now used the S7 for almost 2 months.  The only item I will complain about is the speaker phone when on a phone call.  I can hear the other party great, but they have very bad feed back and tell me to turn off speaker phone.  I attempted some troubleshooting myself and then ended up calling Samsung.  An hour on the phone with them and doing all sorts of weird phone restarts, cache clearing and safe mode tests, there is still no answer as to why the speaker phone does not work.  Is it a physical issue or software issue?  Not a clue and Samsung wants me to factory reset the phone as the next step but I am not sure I want to do that yet.The camera is great.  Phone is quick with all applications and the battery lasts all day long.  If you use the always on screen setting to show the time that kills the battery by at least 4 hours quicker so I don't use that anymore.Because of the speakerphone issue I will knock this review down to a 4 star from a 5 star.

            "
"936","Very very good condition from the seller I got it from. Keep in mind that while Verizon unlocks all their s7s for GSM, If  you use att or cricket you'll lose bands 17 and 12 and will not get lte data or mms messaging. I flashed the unlocked room to the phone and works perfect now.
            "
"937","I bought this phone for my mom to upgrade her from an S4 and she loves it. So far no problems at all. Went to Verizon and got it activated. The rep did have to call Verizon HQs to have it put in the system because for some reason he couldn't do it but once they did that no problems! Buying certified refurbished is the only way to go when your getting a phone for half the price. She's only had the phone since Saturday so we will keep our eye on things to make sure it keeps working good. Received the phone very fast too.
            "
"938","Got this phone for my husband, he is very pleased!

"940","Very happy with my purchase.  Was sceptical like everyone when deciding on a refurbished  phone but so glad I did. When I opened the box the phone was flawless and OEM accessories. I am with Straight talk so I also purchased the Verizon nano sim from Amazon since my old S4 was micro then I was ready to go. I am a very satisfied customer.  Thanks
            "
"941","Very happy with this phone.  Bought it refurbished.  Upgrading from the S4.  32 GB is very nice.  Phone is faster.  Everything worked.  Had to get a new Sim card from my local Verizon dealer, which was easy enough.  Could have cut down the card from the S4, but was easier just to get the new one.  This phone still has headphone jacks, etc., so I am happy with it.  Like this size, like the speed, like the price.
            "
"942","Phone works like new.  Mine came with a charger and headphones like a brand new one would.  No scratches or anything.  Super high quality for refurbished.  The only heads up is that if you are switching from an older phone (I switched from the s5) you will need to get a new, smaller sim card, which is free from Verizon.
            "
"943","Received the phone on time. The charger that came with the phone was slightly bent and also the battery on this phone sucks, it wont even last me during my entire 10 hour work shift which is very unacceptable because my phone is important for my job. Haven't tried contacting the seller because i know they won't help with the battery in a refurbished phone. Once i get paid again i may contact the seller or just go to a phone repair service to have a new battery put in. I will update review then
            "
"944","The phone arrived in perfect condition, without any signs of use. And acts like it's in absolute brand new condition. My phone came with the Samsung fast charger. Bottom line I¡¯m excited whit it.Samsung Galaxy S7 G930V , 32GB, Black Onyx, Verizon + GSM (Certified Refurbished)

"945","A phone is just a phone, made for calling and talking.  NOT anymore.  A cell phone is for Talking, Picture Taking, Note taking, my Calendar, My Appointment Book, for Games, News, Entertainment and on and on...OH did I mention you can even make phone calls, TEXT, send pictures and all that good stuff.  A phone like the Samsung Galaxy S7 is a great 21st Century TOOL.  Thanks Samsung.  CC46

"946","I was  very hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone,  but I am presently surprised on how great the condition of the phone is.  It looks brand new,  came with all factory accessories it should,  headphones charges and transfer adapter.  I obviously can't  evaluate the battery but,  I haven't had any issue with the battery and seem to be new if not in great condition.  I would definitely purchase again
            "
"947","Terrific phone. Battery life is low side.
            "
"948","I had the phone less than 2 weeks when the screen died. I put it in a case and put a screen protector on it within a  hour of it arriving, and never dropped it. But somehow the screen was broken.
            "
"949","This phone only had one light scratch on the back, activation at Verizon was simple. Battery seems fine, exceeds the duration of my former handset.I'd buy another refurb from this vendor (Prime Mobility)
            "
"950","I've been using the new phone for a week and a half, and it's working perfectly. The phone came with all the expected accessories, and I just had to run to my local Verizon store for the SIM card (which I knew I'd have to do). Set up was easy, and the phone looks perfect. I held my breath a bit taking a chance on a certified refurbished phone, but the price difference was hard to pass up. I'll be keeping a close eye on the calendar in case anything happens within the 90-day warranty window, but it's been a great experience so far.
            "
"951","Had to return phone. I was afraid it would get on fire, besides its performance was quite slow and freezing at times. A refurbished phone is a risky business.
            "
"952","It's taking a little getting used to since I upgraded from an S3, but I definitely like it.  No issues so far other than operator lack of knowledge.
            "
"953","Works perfectly. 9.9/10 condition. No complaints at all. Only works on Verizon so I had to change carriers, but my fault for not reading the description carefully.
            "
"954","Overall, the phone is pretty good. Samsung did a good job. The handset I received is a close facsimile but its obvious that when it was refurbished some lower quality parts/methods were used. The screen is plagued with under-sensitivity. It can be downright frustrating to text or try to play games on it and have to deliberately press harder to get it to respond. The under-sensitivity also causes it to be unusable even with thin gloves. The charge port is also recessed on my particular handset. This hasn't caused any issues with charging yet, but it does make using a gear VR very frustrating. For the cost vs. a new one I can live with these faults, but I'll end up trading it in for a new phone much sooner than I would have if it worked as well as it should.
            "
"955","Great phone! Works great did show some wear on the phone but not enough to be an issue. Other reviewers stated they got extras with their phones which you can't expect, nor was there a fast charger with it there was just a basic charger.
            "
"956","just great. the phone was in perfect shape. no scratches or ds all ings.. anything. ive been using it for a couple months now and works perfectly. the only thing is that it comes with a asus charger. it DOES NOT FAST CHARGE and after the first month and some software updates, the phone did not recognize the charger anymore. but. for that price? it does not matter i got the samsung fast charger for 40 at best buy. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS!
            "
"957","I bought this cell phone and it completely broke at the first mild touch. Send a mail to the guys and told me it was not in the warranty. I have reasons to believe these cells are not as resistant as they should be.
            "
"958","the phone came fast.  looked really good.  had no issues getting it on verizon plan.
            "
"959","No problems with the phone. It comes with the charger cord and ear buds. It DOES NOT come with the cord to transfer your data from old phone to new (included when purchasing a new phone). It also does not come with the little key to pop open the little compartment for internal cards--you have to use a paperclip.
            "
"960","The phone seems ok, the only downfall is that the battery life doesn't last long at all. I unplugged it this morning at about 8 and by 11 it was already at 25%. I was sitting in class, so I was hardly even using it.

"969","I got this phone yesterday after deciding to switch from Apple to Android. I have to day that I am pretty happy with this phone. It's listed as refurbished but it runs like it's new. I have not had one issue with anything as far as software goes. Two things that have caught my attention are the battery life and the heating of the phone. During an update or when the phone is charging it tends to get very hot. I googled ways to prevent this and so far that seems to be helping a little. The battery life isn't the best but I mean, there are things you can do to help that along too. All in all, a great buy.
            "

"971","Great upgrade
            "
"972","I would have given this product a 5 star rating but... the seller failed to include the USB adapter needed to perform the built in Smart Switch function for rolling over the contents of your old phone to this one. I solved this problem by ordering one here on Amazon. It should be included with the phone as it is a required piece of hardware.

"979","Bought the gold galaxy s7. Wow!!! If it hadn't been for the plain, discreet white box the phone came in, I would have thought it came brand new straight from verizon! Only wear and tear seem to be where the previous owner used the charging port. And the 3 scratches are miniscule. Otherwise it looks factory new. It came to me with 90% battery. Started right up. Doesn't lag or glitch. It holds a nano Sim which luckily my previous phone had so I just popped it in and it's been working perfectly ever since on the Verizon network. Would totally buy again!! Great product for the price. And it came 1 day ahead of estimated shipping time which was awesome. Took about 5ish days.

"982","How refreshing to get just what I ordered!
            "
"983","The only two drawbacks are (1) speaker sound quality is noticeably lower than a ""new"" phone, and (2) this is with respect to the model in general -- the glass on S7's is apparently pretty delicate, and after dropping it 3 feet onto concrete (with no case), I've learned that glass cracks/repairs are EXPENSIVE. (Apparently the glue and other tech aspects on the S7 mean that you'll almost certainly have to replace the glass *and* LCD/Digitzer. $200 at our local shop, ouch.)

            "
"987","I received my phone a day earlier than promised, so that was good.  It came with the fast charger, which is generic, and a USB. It did not have air buds, no instruction just a plain blank box.  Unfortunately, this so-called fast charger does not charge fast.  There were limited cosmetic flaws but nothing serious. Seems like the camera has limited issues, but i haven't tested it yet. <U+0001F633>  I was able to take it to Verizon to do a switch from my S-6 to the S7. So far, no inherent defects,  when the refurbisher reset the phone they took out all the apps that helped with how to setup the phone, which sucks if you are not Samsung user. I have had it for two days and it's taking me a while to reset the phone, no drop calls, keypad is working. It does not come with a smart switch or the key to pop open the Sim card compartment. It gets really hot.
            "
"988","Had to send back, Was a Verizon ONLY phone, but the description said ""GSM"" which was misleading.

"989","Do not buy this product. Battery exploded.
            "
"990","It's beautiful, and well, as wonderful as you might think it is
            "
"991","Perhaps because it was refurbished, or maybe it's just because its' the S7 but the new keyboard is much more sensitive than the S5 I had and it was constantly coming up with the wrong texts.  In addition people would call me and frequently they could not hear my voice. I could hear them fine, but they could not hear me. Finally, I had my phone in an Otterbox and dropped it a couple of times from a very low height and what appeared to be an ink botch appeared in the lower right hand corner of the phone and continued to spread slowly over the entire screen.  If I had not had it in an Otterbox I would not think twice about it but the Otter box has protected other phones without fail.
            "
"992","I hate this thing. Maybe I'm spoiled by the LG, but the functionality of this Samsung sucks.Three things that drive me nuts the most:#1. To unlock the phone from a sleep state first you have to hit the function button. Then you have swipe the screen. Then you have to swipe your pattern. Compare this to the LG, double tap on the screen puts it to sleep, double tap wakes it up, swipe a pattern if you have one. FAST and easy.#2. Battery non-life. My LG I could go for a week. Even when using it heavily it would last 3 days. 5-7 days if I didn't use it much. The Samsung eats the battery in 2 days if not used and 1 day if it's used.  Yes, you can turn on the battery saver, but then most anytime you need to do anything other than answer a call you have to turn it off. Very much a PITA.#3. Alarm. You have to press and hold, the ""button"" (on the screen not the actual button) and then wait, and wait, and wait, and then swipe to turn it off. LD, tap once and it's done.There are more reasons I dislike this phone. Most of it has to do with the fact that I've used LG most of my life and they function better and faster. If you don't know any better you might like the Samsung, but I'm selling it and going back to the an LG. Yes the camera is better in the S7, but the S7 is much heavier then the LG  I previously had. It's also bigger. Not by a lot in terms of inches, but when I put the LG in my shirt pocket I barely knew it was there. The S7 is like a paperweight more than a phone.
            "
"993","First off, let me say that I don't like Apple phones. I prefer Android much more than iOS, so all problems I have with this phone have purely to do with the phone itself, not the operating system it runs.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy s7 is great. It's a fast phone, has a great camera, quick fingerprint scanner, super high quality screen, and just looks really, really good. But, on the contrary, there are some things I just don't like about this. So, I've made up a pros and cons list:Pros* High quality screen* Looks good* Great camera* Fast fingerprint scanner* Feels comfortable in my hands* Runs smooth and quick* Expandable storage* Durable* Water proofCons* Glass back* Can become slow over time* Occasionally gets hot* Not the best battery life when compared to other popular phonesMy main problem with the Galaxy S7 is the glass back. I absolutely hate it. In fact, it's the reason I don't give this phone 5 stars. Let me explain why.First, the fingerprints. I absolutely hate it when my phone gets fingerprints all over it, as I'm sure many of you do too. An aluminum backing, like the iPhone and Google Pixel use, is much better. Not only does it not get those finger prints, but it also doesn't crack.I've had the glass backing on mine crack twice now. The first time  I tossed my phone and the back hit a hard piece of plastic and cracked. I got it replaced with OEM glass within a week of that happening.One day, I was in class lighting leaning against a desk talking with my friends with my phone in my pocket. All of the sudden I heard a cracking noise only to pull out my phone and find the back cracked. Again.So, with that said, know this phone is super good and I absolutely love it, but my issues with the glass back has been enough to make me want to switch away from Samsung. I'm likely going to get a Google Pixel next.
            "
"994","Had an S5 and an S7, and I have not gone back to a Galaxy since breaking my S7 and do not plan on ever going back.The S7 was great in the beginning,but after about half a year or maybe less my Galaxy S7 became very buggy (not uncommonly to the point where the phone would have to be restarted), a battery drainer (I am not a heavy phone user, and I keep my screen at 50% brightness at most times), and just frequently frustrating in general.Also the camera is atrocious. It quickly developed a bug where I could not focus on objects within a foot of the lens FOR THE LIFE OF ME.Bottom line, I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone! There are MUCH MUCH MUCH better phones in this price bracket from companies like Motorola, Huawei, Xiaomi, and Essential to name a few.
            "
"995","This refurb was not the quality I expected.1. The screen had obviously never had a screen protector and was scuffed and micropitted.2. It took a long time for the battery to fully charge - 2-1/2 hours from 61%.3. When I turned it on, it was in Chinese!Immediately returned.
            "
"996","This phone will not let you type in your message as you write it. It will always fight you & thinks it's smarter than you. Worse, moving from one screen to another is a royal pain in the a$$. I know how to spell and I want my screens to always be available the same way, so, this phone is very frustrating to me. Other than that, it's dependable, takes good photos, & has lots of memory.
            "
"997","I've had several Samsung Galaxy phones. The gorilla glass is nice. However, I dropped it once, with a protective case on it and it cracked all the way down the back. It appears that the back glass is not as strong as the front. I'm done with Samsung phones. I'm going to have to carry a cracked phone for at least a couple of years.
            "
"998","Not my favorite phone. Texting is terrible. I've typed things over and over and they are still wrong. You can be watching a video and sit the phone down and it disappears. I do not recommend.

"999","I have had my s7 for over a year now. It runs flawlessly. I've used it for lawn care and has passed the rain and dust resistant tests. Unfortunately, dropped my S7 in a few inches of snow in Colorado and it ONLY messed up the battery. WILL BE PURCHASING A SECOND S7 > ANY OTHER PHONE OUT. PRICE AND QUALITY MATCH.
