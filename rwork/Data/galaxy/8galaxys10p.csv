"1","Its the best smartphone, but Its 300$ more expensive than on the official samsung page
            "
"2","Don't buy international version if you live in the USA. Things like Samsung pay and carrier account apps do not work due to software version on phone.

            "
"4","I suprised my wife for her birthday. She is all about it. Everything in the box was in order. The phone came with a electric adapter to use with foreign outlets. While this is actually a nice charger it is really bulky. But no big deal.

"13","This phone IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH AMERICAN CELLULAR ACCOUNTS!!! DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU HAVE A VERIZON ACCOUNT it will give you so so many problems and you wont be able to send MMS messages its bizarre and I've been told its directly due to the phone it is not completely open to cellular providers like it claims. Do NOT purchase if you are a Verizon user or have any other US phone company you will regret it

"14","I love it other than the fact that it's an international phone. it was difficult to set up
            "
"15","This phone is a bomb. Love the color love fit. This phone is just my new love. The dual sim works best for me because I work outside to US time to time, therefore I can have 2 sims in this beautiful phone. The shipping time was good (in 2 days).

"28","Great display , finger print sensor is not great.  Samsung 1UI is good. Hopefully software upafe will help with the finger print sensor, one was said to be released but I havent gotten it yet. I upgrading from an s8 so for me this is a good jump but if you have an s9 then I would wait for the note 10 or the fold if you have the money
            "
"29","Avoid at all cost. There is a known issue with this phone with dropped calls and software issues, but Samsung would never put that out. I had to get a new phone after owning it less than a week. Dropped calls and when I went to settings to check software updates, it informed me the version installed on the phone was not supported. Luckily my carrier bent over backwards to try and fix it with no luck, so they hooked me up with a Note 9. Which I love. Until this issue is corrected, stay away from this phone.
            "
"30","Let me start by saying that I absolutely LOVE this phone. It is by far the best phone I've ever used! The battery life lasts ALL DAY! Probably a day an a half. As I'm typing this, my phone is currently at 42%, and that's with messeging, videos, games, all since about 8am, and it's now about 11pm.It's speedy, feels great in the hand, the camera is great and speedy.The only complaint that I have is the finger print scanner. It's not nearly as fast as my previous LG V20 and not as accurate. I also don't like the placement. I like it to be on the back side of the phone, where my index finger is naturally, like where the V20. It's a minor thing, but doesn't detract from the overall experience of the phone.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE!

"31","so far the phone seems to work well.  I gave this to my girlfriend in costa rica, she absolutely loves it.  for now I can say no issues to date with the phone. it was unlocked and it works internationally

"32","S10 is the standard for cell phones.  You will not be disappointed if you are switching from Apple products.  Amazon price was better than store prices.
            "
"33","This phone came new and was in new condition, it arrived in time
            "
"34","10+ 128 GB is great purchase, definitely advanced over competition from Huawei and Apple, at reasonable price.

"35","I've had the phone since the week it came out. I've enjoyed the features and the camera can't be beat. Unfortunately, all that cool hardware and software is bundled in a case that is flimsier than a butterfly's wings and more slippery than greased slug snot. The thing has slipped out of my pocket and fell out of my car twice. I have a low car, so the fall was only about 8 inches. The first time, it shattered the screen protector that came on the phone and knicked the bottom corner of the infinity screen. Tonight was the second time and the glass back (glass, seriously?) shattered. While having a phone that breaks when you look at it hard is bad enough, the infinity screen makes it impossible to hold and use. Why? Because the entire screen is ""touch"" sensitive. So just holding it means that you're touching the screen somewhere. Try typing when two other fingers are activating the screen somewhere else. I want to like this phone, but I just hate it. I hate that you can't use it. I hate that you can't carry it. And I hate that just being in the same room with it breaks it. Awful design from a company that has been making worse phones with each generation. My wife says thank you, Samsung... you just made me an Apple guy. Oh, and ZERO support from Samsung. Used to be a great company.

"36","I got mine direct from the Mays Landing NJ store and the phone does not work.  I have insurance on it as well and they won't cover it.  Been a 2-week nightmare.  Can't make phone calls, can't use the internet or any apps.  Complete and total lemon and they won't honor the warranty.  Paying the lease payments and over $350 for our family plan.  Been with sprint for 19 years now.  Some sort of glitch with the phones and they put out a March 27th, 2019 update that made it even worse.  The store won't do anything, insurance company Asurion says they have no phones to give me and won't do anything, customer care won't handle it.  Transferred on the phone over 20 times, about 40 hours into trying to get this $1,000 brand new phone to work.

"37","phone is great but somehow got a small divot in my screen protector-was told by verizon store rep for $50 they would replace the protector and it would be a lifetime warranty-great but for a $1000 phone that comes with said protector-it should be warrantied for life! otherwise why put it on there ? C'mon samsung do the right thing-a great phone with 1 little problem..
            "
"38","Great phone, amazing camera.I wasn't expecting it to come with a phone case, that was a very pleasant surprise.I'm not a fan of the USB-C port but that's no biggie.
