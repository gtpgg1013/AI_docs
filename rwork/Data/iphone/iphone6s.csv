"1","You're probably reading comments all paranoid like I did. Lol. This is a positive review. I LOVE IT. Looks brand new. Works fast and great. If you have any questions about my experience you can contact me at my Instagram @abenaasf
            "
"2","Poor quality control. It was wiped, but was still registered to the prior owner. I contacted the seller (Breed), and they would not replace for another unit. I would not trust this seller.
            "
"3","So I purchased two phones from these guys, noting mostly positive reviews from their previous customers.  Both arrived in really good shape and appeared to work properly.  However, while one of them has had no issues, the other one has had intermittent reception issues and now will not hold a charge.  Clearly the device has some problems and now needs a new battery.  I purchased these less than 6 months ago and got Square Trade warranties, which unfortunately do not cover battery replacement. The seller only offers a very conditional 90 day warranty.  The moral of this story?  Sometimes you get a good phone and sometimes you get a piece of junk.  Buyers beware!
            "
"4","So I thought I¡¯d wait a bit after my purchase to make a review about this product because I know some things can happen later on and I didn¡¯t want to regret rating incorrectly.For starters, the product came exactly when it was supposed to. A+ for fast shipping. I was excited to receive my package but a little disappointed that they¡¯d just left it in front of my door. It¡¯s a good thing I was able to be home at the time and expecting it. I thought since it¡¯s a phone, they¡¯d want a sign off.Anywho, after opening I started to inspect the phone. The screen and back appeared to have some white smudge marks on them (I still have no idea what they were) but I was able to clean it with an alcohol wipe. There also appeared to be something white completely covering the speakers and inside the charge port which put me off a bit. I became worried.Since I¡¯ve received the phone, the performance has been normal. No shutting off randomly, no bugging, nothing a phone shouldn¡¯t be doing. It¡¯s been performing completely normal as it should be and charging at a pretty good speed, especially since I use my phone for work and play. The only complaint I have there is the speakers, which don¡¯t appear to sound very loud. Speaker phone doesn¡¯t really help with that either. The camera works well and so does the flash. No worries there. The phone was unlocked as stated and I was able to immediately connect my phone service with it.I haven¡¯t dropped it yet (knocks on wood) & hopefully I won¡¯t ever. The 6s has been my favorite version since it came out.For the price of the phone, the overall of it is great. I would definitely recommend it to others and hopefully you¡¯ll all get the most out of it. As for any iPhone, I also recommend purchasing a shockproof case at the same time of your phone purchase.I hope my honest review helps any others looking to buy their phones online.

"5","It was good and perfect for a week, and the battery died and it never turned back on, i am very disappointed i want a refund
            "
"6","The device is not unlocked for international use, it is unlocked for only US network carriers, i had to pay $70 to get it working in My home country. overall the phone is awesome, its new and does not have any wear or scratches on it
            "
"7","Phone is in perfect cosmetic condition. No knicks, dings, or scratches. Screen is also perfect (no scratches, dead pixels, etc). Phone performs perfectly as well. Buying refurbished can be nerve wracking but this seller did not disappoint. Thank you!
            "
"8","I brought my iPhone 6s from seller Chubbiestech. The only negative thing I would say was I ordered this phone with express 2 day shipping but I didn¡¯t get in until my third day. I ordered the phone Wednesday expecting it to come Friday but it arrived Monday.None the less, this phone is awesome. Just because I received this phone after 2 days late, the phone itself outweighs my only con. This phone was totally unlocked. The description says only GSM unlocked (AT&T and T-Mobile) but my Verizon prepaid service (CDMA) works perfectly fine with this phone. I thought I would have to switch my service but I¡¯m glad I didn¡¯t have to. It was very easy to set up and this phone damn near is brand new. There¡¯s is only one little nic on the top gold part but when you put an case on it, it will hide it all.This phone came with a generic usb charger, car charger price, phone case, sim opener, and my phone came with a screen protector already on.I highly recommend buying from Chubbiestech.
            "
"9","It was locked and under some one's contract with an unpaid bill.I didn't like it - complete waste of time
            "
"10","The phone lasts less than 12 hours after 20 minutes of talk, a handful of texts, and a small bit of web browsing. wifi and bluetooth are on. For comparison, with my old iphone 6, that's at least a year older than what this outfit sold me, in the same environment and settings, I get close to 24 hours.  I contacted customer support and they said that's not a problem for them, they test only for it to last 10 hours. They offered return and refund, but this is wasting my time. I offered for them to instead pay for the $29 Apple battery replacement offer, but they declined. Considering that I'll replace the battery anyway if I get a different refurb'ed phone, I'll keep this one and get the battery replaced in a few weeks once I know the unit is otherwise working well, since MyWit support said if I have Apple replace the battery it'll void their warranty.
            "
"11","The phone is really great! I was worrying that the phone will have scratches or will be locked, BUT IT IS PERFECT! Perfect condition!
            "
"12","My wife has been on a REALLY old phone (iPhone 4S!!!), so as an early Valentine's Day gift for her, I decided to get her this rose gold iPhone 6S-- she was really blown away by it!!! I bought the phone from Chubbiestech, they shipped it really fast! The phone is Certified Refurbished, but it basically looks and works as if it were a brand new phone!
            "
"13","I have been a customer of Amazon's for 10 years. I'm pleased to say I have never had a poor experience from anything I've purchased. The exception to that being this refurbished cellphone. The phone I bought was actually quite nice, looked practically brand new. Issue was the battery barely lasted a day. But the REAL issue was the fact that even though it was unlocked and I had a SIM card I knew worked (because I took it out of my working Iphone 6) the phone would intermittently (at best) work with T-Mobile. It was show full service and LTE and then just no data or cell service. It would then go to 4G or 3G and then to no service. If I put it in airplane mode and then back out of airplane mode it would maybe start working.THAT SAID, I figure, hey the package says to just call the third party that actually sold the phone for support. I did that 3 times and I also emailed them. Contrary to their claim DealFisher didn't care about my business or more importantly my satisfaction seeing I never got a call or email from them. I called T-Mobile and Amazon, both of which worked with me for about 30 minutes each trying to get the phone to work to no avail. I ended up packing up the phone and returning it and just bought a new phone from a friend. Long story short is I will NEVER trust a refurbished device again thanks to this experience and I will be very hesitant to use a third party seller on amazon again.My recommendation to you is: amazon does have a great 90 day return policy so if you're trying to scrape by and get a pretty decent and new-like phone give it a shot, you might get lucky. I'd say have a CLOSE look at the seller's reviews and see if they seem to sell junk phones to lots of people. And my best advice, never purchase from DealFisher!
            "
"14","I¡¯m not going to lie, I was terrified of ordering a refurbished phone from amazon especially with all the mixed reviews. However after reading through the reviews from one specific seller (BuySpry) I felt a little more confident! My phone came on time, with a little difficulty though, but that has more to do with FedEx than it has to do with the seller.... Anyways my phone looks as good as new, the quality is great and I was able to insert my sim with ease and no problems so I¡¯m very happy! I would recommend ordering from BuySpry if possible... they have some of the best reviews I¡¯ve seen as far as sellers go.... also be mindful when changing GB and color because the sellers change as well. Anyways I¡¯m very pleased and happy I ordered!.....Okay, I¡¯ve had this phone for little over a month now and I¡¯ve realized that when I take photos, it always makes the shutter noise (even in silent mode). I¡¯ve done some research and found out that this is because iPhones intended to be sold in certain countries dont allow you to turn off the noise, for privacy reasons. Tbh this is really annoying to me and bothersome, I have anxiety so to take pictures in silent places and have your camera shutter is like the worse for me. This isn¡¯t to deter people from buying this phone but just be mindful that this might be a problem for you as well. However I still love my phone quite a lot and would still recommend!

"15","Bought a new phone for my dad for fathers day! Even though it was pink only this seller had positive reviews and I didnt want to end up with a dud. Came right on time had to sign for it and in an iphone-esque box. All good i put it in a nice case and my dad was good to go! Works great no issues at all. Could see some wear and tear around the part where you charge and head phone insert but overall great job on the refurb!! Idk about other sellers but Chubbie is the truth. Ps i was not paid for this i shelled out over $200 of my own money.
            "
"16","This cellphone has a hardware problem. I reset it but still the same problem. The apps doesnt work, it shut downs spontaneously and sometimes it freezes and i have to reset the phone to make it work again. Doesn't work please I need you to contact me in order to solve this problem
            "
"17","I received this phone to find the outer shell and screen in good condition. However, after I ran diagnostics on the battery, I was disappointed to find that it was not in healthy condition. The ""design capacity"" of the battery was at ~75% and had been cycled through over 400 complete charge cycles. All this to say, the battery was in a significantly used and degraded condition. If you order an Amazon Certified Refurbished phone, just keep in mind that it you may receive a phone/battery in similar condition.
            "
"18","First off all before I get to the phone the charger wasn't working, it was a third party charger that wasn't supported. And now  the phone had scratches! (that I didn't mind) but when I I stared using it I realized that sensor isn't working! So the  certified refurbished is just a lie it's a used broken item that someone sent back!
            "
"19","I complained about the battery (Because i have to charge it everyday at least 2 or 3 times) and the seller has done nothing about it.
            "
"20","I was so nervous about ordering a refurbished phone, but needed to replace my iPhone 6s and needed an affordable option. So glad I took the chance, as so far has worked out great! Phone came packaged nicely in box (not original iPhone box) and included charger. Note that it did not include the headphones which was not an issue for me, not sure I would want refurbished headphones anyways. Phone was very clean and looked brand new. Set up was super easy as expected (no manual, but again not needed) and has been working perfectly. I am so thankful there is a trustworthy company offering an affordable option for this phone, and would buy from them again.
            "
"21","Previously I gave a two on this product.  However, I believe it was most likely my mistake of not knowing what I was doing.  I complained that the battery did not stay charged.  The first night it did not, but after speaking with my sister I realized that it may have been updating the first night and that is what ran the battery down so quickly.  I was very busy and decided to try to deal with it a few more days.  As it turns out it seems to be working great.  There is one small problem, it doesn't tell me what percentage of power is left.  It shows the icon that show approximately how much battery life it has, but it doesn't name the percentage and I don't really like that.  However, it's not something I can't live with and will be keeping this phone unless there turns out to be new issues.
            "
"22","Sold By Platinum DealsShipped By AmazonHad less than 24 hours before initiating return!!!Pros: Great physical condition, screen in perfect condition, boxed pretty good. charger seemed to charge fast.Cons: Battery was at less than 50% of its life according to the technician at the Apple Store they said it needed replaced immediately(was supposed to have at least 80% of its battery life left), two small scratches on the back of the phone, came in plain white box, off-brand charger, no headphones.If the battery would have been at 80% or better than I would have definitely recommend this phone and company but because of the battery needing replaced immediately after receiving the phone I sadly would not recommend this company! I am returning and trying one from VIP Outlet so I will update this when I see what the Apple Store says about the new one.
            "
"23","The refurb on this phone was AWFUL! First -  The phone came in and within 20 minutes the screen was glitching.  It kept detecting that 1 spot on the screen kept being touched repeatedly.  First I thought it was the screen protector, so I took it off.  That didn't fix it.  So I did a factory reset and that fixed it for like 3 days, then it started happening again daily and wouldn't stop until I restarted the phone.  Another thing that happens is that at least once I day I have to reset to get the touch screen to detect touch properly... It'll detect the touch about 1/8 inch from where I actually touch the screen.  Next the battery it came with is crap.. it's already degraded down to 73%.  I have to pay to get another battery.  And finally - the screen autodims out of nowhere, setting show it's as bright as it goes, but in bright sunlight I can't see crap because it has decided to dim itself out.  I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A REFURB FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!  BUYER BEWARE!**edit... Took my phone in to replace the battery and was told all my problems from day one were because of water damage.  They sold me an extremely water damaged phone.  All I could do was replace it.
            "
"24","My Phone Came In Great Condition From ¡°Chubbiestech¡± even though it Said refurbished the phone looked perfectly new I was expecting a small scratch or dent but there was nothing. I got the phone in the end of February and it still works great and in good condition it also came with a charger, screen protector, and sim card tool but no headphones.I hoped this helped some of you all with your choice.
            "
"25","The iPhone died after the 90 day window and the only response was 'too bad'.  If you can't certify that the product will function you shouldn't sell it as certified refurbished.
            "
"26","Bought this phone for my son who is 11 and thought it will be a good option to get refurbished rather than a new one , given his age . However, this phone¡¯s battery is completely useless ! Noticed battery percentage was going down really fast , then decide it to charge it to 100% and even set it to power  saving mode . After a few hours , it went down to 30% without even using  it <U+0001F621>So disappointed with this purchase !! Will never buy from this seller again , would rather stick to Groupon since I bought 2 phones from them and never had any issues like this or any at all !
            "
"27","I was pleasantly surprised when the 6S iphone arrived earlier than expected.  It came in a new box similar to that of a new phone.  I was impressed with a brand new charger adapter and cord neatly wrapped in the box.  The rose colored phone looked virtually new with a protective film of both sides of the phone.  As ordered, the phone was a an unlocked GSM that fired right up after inserting my old TMobile sim card (the old phone went for a dip in our pool.)  All of the old data, contacts, e-mails magically downloaded from the I-Cloud.  I have only had the phone for three days so I cannot comment on its long term reliability but I have no reason to question it.  I selected Amazon Dealfisher because it was sponsored by Amazon and had very high long term ratings.
            "
"28","My was from ¡°myWit¡±, come in perfect condition, no any scratch or other stuff, looks like brandnew.
            "
"29","Basically, I receive it, charge it and start using it.After I have done the setup, I started noticing the touchscreen doesn't work.When typing, it doesn't take what I type in or response multiple times. For example, I tried to type ""run"". Sometimes, it only shows ""un"" or ""rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrun"". After contacting tech support, wipe out the phone and do everything again. After done setting, I don't even have any way to log in because one of my pin numbers has the problem.  Tried to type ""0"", but the same situation happened. So, I decided to return it. When trying to wipe out the phone again, the same thing happened to final confirm wipe out area. Receiving this phone is really frustrating, the seller should check phone thoughtfully before sent out. If they don't, this is just wasting both sides' time and time is money.  Giving one star because sending me something that doesn't work.
            "
"30","Phone meets if not exceeds my expectations of quality for a refurb phone. I had no trouble setting up after popping in my sim card. The battery seems okay. The only damage I noticed was very moderate and shallow scratching on the screen. I didn't even see it until the phone was powered off; it has no effect on the quality of the user experience whatsoever. Charger that came with it was aftermarket and there were no headphones - just as advertised and expected. Charger works just fine. I will be sure to update if I encounter any issues regarding the function. Thanks for the fast shipping! My phone came from Tech Venture, for reference.
            "
"31","Bought this for my daughter and we are very happy with the purchase! Cosmetically, the phone is in brand new, 10/10 condition! Works just like a brand new phone. Cord & block are aftermarket & work great, but we already had Apple branded cord and block so she is using those. Set up was simple. For Straight Talk I just switched the sim from her 5s to the 6s. Will update on battery life after some use, but so far it is working perfectly and my daughter couldn't be happier! (My pictures aren't the best quality, so anything that may look imperfect is definitely from my camera and not on the phone itself!)ETA: We're a couple months in & this phone has held up famously. Battery life is perfect, no quirks, no glitches, no loosey goosey ports, nothing wrong at all. Still an A+++
            "
"32","My son dropped his old iPhone in a puddle and parts of the touch screen and display were unusable.  I saw this iPhone at a great price, read the great reviews and figured I would give it a try.  I was easily able to remove the sim card from the old phone and put it in the new phone.  Both were Iphones  6S and everything went fine.  I was unable to find any marks or flaws on the phone, it looked and acted like a brand new phone.  My son has had it for over a month now and reports that its great.
            "
"33","Love the iPhone products but was hoping to save some money on my daughter's phone.  Within 90 days the microphone stopped working.  Well it still worked, it was just impossible to have conversation on the iPhone.  I contacted the seller who could not locate my customer record.  I then contacted amazon for help and they graciously offered to waive the 30 day return window and let me return the phone.  This seemed like a reasonable solution, until I discovered the 20% restocking fee!!  Almost $70 hit on a 2 month old ""refurbished warranty"".  If I would have known I was going to be charged that much, I would have sent it in for repairs as per their product warranty.  I guess I will be buying my phones new from now on.
            "
"34","This iPhone 6s is a good size, nice looking, is a reliable alarm clock, texting is easy, however, I cannot make or receive a phone call.  I always get ""I cannot hear you, you are fading in and out"".....  It has been this way since I got the phone.  Would not buy a certified refurbished phone again.
            "
"35","This 6S arrived in two days as advertised.  It was in new condition with the exception of two tiny marks on the back and a very small scuff on one corner. The glass was perfect. This phone is a replacement for my 5S, which I had backed up on my Macbook. The Macbook and 6S refused to talk to one another and I finally had to call T-Mobil. Working with their tech, I finally was able to convince the computer and phone to communicate. It turns out the phone was woefully behind in software updates. It must have been sitting on a shelf for an extended period. Once we got the downloads going it took over 20 minutes to complete.  Ultimately, I spend almost an hour working with T-Mobil, but the tech was great.IMPORTANT: I was careful to buy the phone from DealFisher, which is the highest rated vendor I could identify.
            "
"36","I purchased this product for my daughter and just after the 60 day warranty the phone stopped working.  Prior to that the battery would not hold...we figured we would need to replace the battery since Apple sent out the notification; however, when we went to replace it, the repair man said the phone was broken and wasn't worth fixing....Money wasted and this seller is selling JUNK!  Save your money and buy elsewhere.  There is zERO PRODUCT SUPPORT HERE.

"37","I purchased this iPhone 2 months ago on 10/04/18. The phone worked fine at the beginning but 3 days later the battery started messing up that i had to take it to get the battery replaced. Now 2 months later my iPhone died completely. I placed my phone on the counter the night before. The next day when i wanted to use it the phone was completely dead. I thought the battery had died so i charged it during the day for hours waiting for it to turn on. It never did so i took it to get it fixed once again. At the place they told me it was the RAM of the phone that didn't work at all. I don't know how this happened because i took good care of the phone. That is why i give it a 2 over all rating.
            "
"38","I purchased this phone for my sister to replace a lost one.  She absolutely loves it!  So far I haven't heard any complaints from her.  The company who sold the phone sent it promptly, with a letter assuring that if I needed anything to contact them.  It's only been a few days, but so far so good.  Also the phone was in excellent condition and she no problem having her carrier- At&T activate the phone.  I keep you posted if anything goes wrong.

"39","This is my first time buying a phone online and I was skeptical but I¡¯am so glad I purchased my phone through Amazon and Dealfisher!

"40","One negative was that the battery condition was 85% of a new battery.  A poor battery (replacement) was the reason that my original unit was being replaced and I anticipated a new condition battery.  It was otherwise in essentially new, condition.  I would consider refurbishing including a new battery if, on checking, the original battery was only 85% of new.  The unit works well and this is not grounds to return it.  It just means some minor decrease in battery life.  Since I routinely recharge overnight, it is, for me at least, a minor problem.
            "
"41","Didn't meet delivery deadline and t phone stop working 1 week afterwards.
            "
"42","Ordered the phone and it arrived on time and packaged nicely.  No real signs of wear, and phone booted fine.  The problem ensued about two days after getting the phone.  It would no longer hold a full charge and began shutting off at around 18% to 24%, depending on if it was in power saver or not, a clear sign that the battery was defective.  For a refurbished phone that is supposed to ""work like new,"" that is unacceptable.  My son has an iPhone SE that he has had for a year and a half that has better battery life and battery wear than this phone.  Thankfully, we were able to get a refund, but I would not buy from this seller again.  Now I am down a phone and not sure if I am willing to trust any ""certified refurbished"" phone again.
            "
"43","Product description reads ""certified to work and look like new"". They are no where near like new. Mine came with a broken camera and the phone looks like it's 50 years old. The quality on Amazon is getting worse by the day. Instead of wasting his time with his blog WaPo, Jeff Bezos should focus more on his business and make sure Amazon stops degrading so rapidly.

"44","I have bought this phone on June 25th but for some reason stopped working on October not even 3 month ..Now phone isn't turning on it seemed battery is dead or damaged ..I will complaint with Amazon
            "
"45","One of the first things they mention is that the phones are professionally inspected. Upon arriving, the phone wouldn't even turn on no matter how many times I tried or chargers I used. They gave me a lemon that clearly was never checked. Will be returning, fingers crossed the next one is remotely usuable.
            "
"46","The phone was great for the first couple of weeks, but then started acting up. The camera first started to lock up then the phone itself started to get hot. I tried contacting the seller thru email and even tried to call but never got a response. Of course now the phone is past its 30 day warranty.

I am not able to switch it on at all. I am in India and Apple Service Center is not repairing the same saying that it is out of Warranty. I have paid so much money and the same has gone waste. Apple Service Center in India has checked the history of this purchased IPhone through its IMEI Number and says that this phone has earlier also faced the same problem and now again the phone is dead. I have no idea what to do. I do not recommend anyone to buy Certified Refurbished IPhones.

"51","This phone came as new! Mywit is a good seller! It came with a new adapter and charger cord. It¡¯s legit. The only thing I didn¡¯t like was that I paid for two day shipping and it didnt come til 4 days later but that wasn¡¯t amazon¡¯s or the seller¡¯s fault. FedEx is the worst delivery company. I will never use them again. Overall the phone is awesome. No scratches. No dents. Everything works. And I had no problem with my sims card. I¡¯m so in love with the color (Rose Gold)

"52","I have had this phone for about a month and it has been working great. It looks brand new. No scratches or cracks. Battery doesn't last as long as it would if it were brand new but still lasts pretty long. Usually charge it once a day or twice if I'm constantly on it. The price is great and more affordable than buying it brand new. It worked fine with my T-Mobile service.
            "
"53","This is a great phone and it worked right out of the box, mostly.  I plugged in my T-Mobile sim card and the phone worked immediately.The only reason this product isn't getting 5 stars is that it shipped with the ear speaker clogged with gunk to the point that no sound came through until I cleaned it out myself.  Also, the cable that it came with didn't work (which I didn't realize until I was camping in the middle of nowhere with a dead phone).
            "
"54","My phone came 4 days early which is great. This is an honest review guys so I am going to be very honest. I ordered from the seller OlympicWireless and also fulfilled by amazon. When I opened the box the phone looked amazing. The only thing was the home button wouldn¡¯t press down. It still worked so that was no big deal. The battery health was at 86% which is not bad at all. Camera looks great and all the buttons work. I have not yet activated it because it is a gift for my sister as she is going from an android to an iPhone. As far as mechanics, it works great. I will be giving feedback as she uses the phone for a longer period of time
            "
"55","First off: I¡¯m the one that reads all the reviews, but have literally NEVER posted a review. This warranted one. The seller was Buyspry. The phone was absolutely FLAWLESS! Not a single scratch, dent, or mark. It¡¯s was packaged beautifully and even had a screen protector already on it. I¡¯m on day two of using the phone, everything works great and the battery life is what I typically had by the end of the day with my old iPhone. Hope this review helps anyone else who is like me in regards to reading all reviews prior to purchasing.

"56","Very pleased. Searched quite a while and this was a great value.

"57","Some of the reviews were scary so I purchased this with some trepidation. Unwarranted. My purchase arrived on time, looks new, was unlocked, no glitches and the battery life is great. Just wished it came with a $50 iTunes phone card. In other words, I have no sensible complaints.

"58","Phone as described. Arrived 3 days earlier than expected. In excellent cosmetic condition. Battery life isn¡¯t all that great for extreme use and provided charger doesn¡¯t work but overall its a great buy.
            "
"59","Phone was in perfect working order.  It was unlocked as stated and there were no flaws in anything.  The phone even had the new plastic film to protect the screen and the back from scratches.  Have been using the phone for several months now with no issues.  Love it and would do business with these people again!
            "
"60","After four months of owning the phone, it shut off and would only enter recovery mode. I brought the phone to the Apple store. They told me that the whoever owned the phone prior tampered with it. Additionally, they mentioned that there was a hole in the phone where on a normal 6s there is no hole. Highly disappointed in the lack of quality and inspection in the refurbishment and will never waste my money again with this seller.
            "
"61","I was worried looking at a lot of the bad reviews to see if my phone would come out bad. So I took my chances and bought from the seller Chubbistech and I was very impressed by what had come, the quality of the phone was perfect with no scratches on the screen or anything. The phone was unlocked and worked with my sim. Over all a great phone.I want specifically mention the seller Chubbiestech from whom I ordered the phone. A very ethical and professional company with great customer care service. The person from their company Karen was very prompt in replying to my queries and was very helpful. O would definitely recommend to buy from this seller. A+
            "
"62","excellent product, without a minimum of detail, like new, without the most minimal cosmetic detail, excellent conditions, apart from what interested me that should be UNLOCKED for all operators, indeed it is and I can use it in Venezuela, I recommend this seller MyWit for future purchases, products of very high quality and cute packaging plus OEM accessories, thank you.
            "
"63","I bought 2iphones with 64 GB. I got one with so many scratches on the screen surface and I returned it. I thought 2nd one is fine. After I used the other one for 20 days I realized it's actually 16 GB. Few days ago i travelleld to India and I can't return it now.I got cheated overall.vwry bad expy
            "
"64","The phone arrived in an attractive MyWit box with warranty card. Condition of device was very good - screen is mint without scratches, battery is at 96% capacity, and back has one scratch and minor scratching around charging port. All in all a great deal and I would buy a refurbished iPhone from MyWit again any day. Be careful which seller you choose!
            "
"65","Now I¡¯m forced to change my feedback as this mobile is not working. This worked for 45 days and now it has 2 issues:1. Charging goes down from 80-90% to 10% or 0% sometimes.2. I¡¯m using same network in my both mobiles but this mobile appears as ¡®no service¡¯. To get the network, either restart or wait for it to appear.Now I¡¯ve to bare restocking fee and return shipping charges as return window period is over. Will not buy anymore used products.
            "
"66","I have waited 4 months so I could give a quality interview on this. Refurbished means that this phone once upon a time was used, so something was bound to be wrong. This phone overall performs really well and was a lot faster than my phone before this. The camera on this is quite astounding for how old it is compared to the newer phones. The only problem with this phone is the ringer button by the sound buttons. I have to fidget with it to keep it so the phone will stay silent and not turn off. Sometimes it can be a pain, but the phone in of itself is great and I would totally recommend from these guys. It came in a day early and was easy to setup.
            "
"67","phone was great. as advertised, but only lasted less than 4 months. had a 90 day warranty, which I get. asked supplier if they would do a discount to buy another under the circumstances and they said NO.
            "
"68","I got this phone from TechVenture. I ordered this phone on a Wednesday and the estimated shipping was from Next Tuesday to Next Thursday. However I got the product Monday, a day earlier. The products looks and works like brand new. No sign of use. I was able to add service to the phone with no problems. I love my new phone.
            "
"69","My iPhone was good for the first two months. After that it kept glitching a few times a day for no reason. It's still usable because it freezes for like fifteen second everytime. But these fifteen seconds could be frustrating if you were in hurry and it kept happening to you a lot.I don't recommend this product.
            "
"70","It was completely as advertised. No scratches or signs of wear. It works great and still $100+ below buying a new phone of the same age. I rated the battery life low just because it came at 85%. which is above  the guaranteed minimum. It would be perfect if the batteries were replaced.
            "
"71","What can I say about an iPhone other than it works.The phone was refurbished properly and I couldn't find any scratches or blemishes.  The battery is decent and it looked new.
            "
"72","LOVE this phone. I was originally very very weary and hesitant to buy from a third party especially after reading some horrible reviews. But this phone has been an absolute gem for me. I have had no problems yet. (knock on wood). It arrived in great condition as described. I am overall very pleased with this
            "
"73","Working great. I got the H2O wireless sim card and installed it in the phone. Called customer service and gave them the code for it. They updated my account with the new sim card and everything was transmitted to my phone with out any glitches. I did not have the pics but I had them saved on my PC and plugged in the phone to get them.
            "
"74","The product was good but its battery life is horrible. I mean you can see it drain in front of you within minutes. To add to to this, in cold temperatures you will see it go from 100% to 0% in like 2-3 minutes. This is the biggest flaw in this phone. I do not recommend people to buy this.
            "
"75","I had a 6S for a few years. We purchased this refurbished for my husband who didn¡¯t want to spend a lot on a newer phone. Battery capacity is only 84%. I assumed with a refurbished product it would have a new battery.
            "
"76","Works great and looks new.
            "
"77","i got mine from refurb outlet, at first i was very skeptical by looking at the reviews, but then my phone came and worked absolutely awesome no problems with it,came 2days early,and i recommend buying from refurb outlet everything is good about the phone, have no complaints
            "
"78","This refurbished phone was a dud. Its buttons were stiff on the sides. Somethng inside was loose and would rattle around like a screw.  After all of this it never powered again after the initial set up.  Dont buy refurbished unlss from Apple.
            "
"79","Had trouble with this unit.  When I would go to recent calls the screen would turn milky and I could not read the call.  Too clear this I would have to go back to the home page and reboot the unit.  After dealing with this issue so long I sent it back.
            "
"80","I bought this phone in June 2017Stop working after being reset by itself on August 2018Still brand new, turn on and charging correctly, Sim card show up normallyThe only issue, it doesn't give any access to any source of network (Wifi and Data) and it doesn't work via ITunes for the reactivationGo everywhere with it, they say it might be a server problem. Only Apple can check it.I don't have Apple store near meSo sad
            "
"81","Arrived in good shape with a few tiny imperfections.  Excellent value
            "
"82","Got the phone was unlocked and at first thought the volume was not working turns out the volume button was off love it now, doesn't hold a lot of charge for long but overall not bad definitely on board for the apple family.
            "
"83","Got this phone for my little sister (17yrs) and she love it. She said it works just fine. There were no scratches or anything. Although the battery life ain't so great but it an't bad either
            "
"84","My screen began malfunctioning a couple months in - it did it intermittently so I thought perhaps it was my screen cover and didn't contact the seller. It turns out, it was not my screen cover, it's the phone. It's barely functional. To make matters worse, the ringer doesn't work. I wish I'd spent my money elsewhere. I have bought refurbished products from other sellers previously with no issues.
            "
"85","Literally was skeptical because I researched and found negative reviews about refurbished phones, but this phone came and not a scratch or dent was on it! Looked new felt new and the battery life is great!
            "
"86","Didn't have a problem activating, MEID was clean. Just had to get new SIM card from my carrier. Will update review if anything changes, so far so good!
            "
"87","It started out where it would say no service in areas that i had service previously and I am disappointed in that. Now almost 9 months later, and the phone will die so quickly. The  battery barely lasts. I am pretty upset. Sometimes it will die at 6% or so. Overall I am not impressed and would not recommend as a solid day-to-day phone. I wish the battery was not so bad.
            "
"88","I was a little skeptical after I saw all these reviews from, so many different sellers. But when I got a gold 64gb iPhone 6s from the seller MyWit, I actually was surprised to see it in a professional looking box, in perfect looking condition. There wasn¡¯t even so much as a scratch or dent on the phone! I¡¯ve had it for around 2-3 days now and see no problems at all so far. Would definitely recommend from this seller
            "
"89","I have long thought whether to buy here iphone 6s, because of the large number of negative reviews. Still decided to buy and did not regret it! Case and screen in perfect condition - no scratches! For this price-it's the perfect device.
            "
"90","For one, this phone is not virgin mobile compatible even though it pops up when you type in virgin mobile phones.Secondly, the phone was dirty. Something sticky like a booger on the power button and the screen was all smudgy. I know it's refurbished, but it feels like a 12 year old refurbished it. Will be returning it, lesson learned.
            "
"91","I bought two of these phones. One came as good as new, the other one not quite. The main microphone does not work during calls but It does for taking voice notes. Also there is no way to silence camera shutter sound due to the fact that the phone came with an asian software version. It also came with lots of dirt inside both the power and the headphone connectors. Unfortunately I was able to try phone calls when I got back to my country and now I dont have the chance to take it back and ask for a refund. I regret not having bought the Galaxy S7 in B&H. One extra star because the rest works just fine.
            "
"92","I really needed to upgrade my phone but since I don't have a contract, it seemed financially out of reach until I found this phone on Amazon. I love my new phone from how it looks to how it performs. I only have to charge my phone once a day now when on my old phone was constantly plugged in.
            "
"93","iPhone 6s came in a good condition. The box it came seemed to be used a lot. Looked like a box to send iPhones for repair. The phone itself came in an almost perfect condition. The preowner was probably using a protection screen. The screen came without scratches in that area where the protection screen was placed. Right next to it little scratches on the glass, but totally acceptable. USB cord and plug came brand new. No ear plugs. Housing was also without scratches. At the end ""all good"" !
            "
"94","They phone is in great shape. But the ba3 life is bad, Dies after 4 hours. I noticed it couldn¡¯t do screenshots n send directly to other applications like Wat¡¯sapp. But if u can take a screenshot (screenmunch) then move to Wat¡¯sapp n look for the pic u just munched, Then u will be fine. Don¡¯t take the delivery timing serz. Always check coz I got charged ( it read deliver by Monday, then it came on Saturday ) other than that. Ur good. The phone is great <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB>
            "
"95","The phone is great, hands down, but there was an issue. Originally, the phone came with a slight problem with the touch screen. It seemed a bit delayed and slow, and at times wouldn¡¯t respond. All I had to do was take the screen off, disconnect it and reconnected. Since it is refurbished, I¡¯m assuming that the screen was replaced and wasn¡¯t connected properly. But the fix only took like 5 minutes, so it¡¯s all good.
            "
"96","Battery on this iPhone had to be replaced with less than 10 months of use..  I'd suggest checking the battery life indicator upon receiving the shipping and return it if it less than 99%...Otherwise the phone works as intended, device came with no scratches and no dents.
            "
"97","Phone died 2 months later, even repurchased another one and it is scratched and looks horrible!
            "
"98","I received my iPhone 6s from DealFisher a little over a week ago, and honestly I couldn¡¯t find any signs that it was refurbished. I can¡¯t find one thing that would differentiate my refurbished iPhone 6s from a new one. The battery life and overall speed of the phone (internet connection, switching apps, etc.) are like new as well. I did notice the speaker has a slight ¡°crackle¡± when the volume is all the way up, but only on loud music or videos. The iPhone I received was in a generic box, it came with an aftermarket lightning cable and power adapter, which does the job. So far, I couldn¡¯t be happier with my purchase.
            "
"99","I got this phone as a replacement to my water damaged iPhone 6, and it arrived in nice packaging with charger included and looks new.  Been using if for a couple days now, and it works great.  It's actually a nice speed upgrade over the iPhone 6 too.  Takes the sting out of dunking my last phone in the river.
            "
"100","El producto esta bloqueado por la cuenta de ICloud, necesito me faciliten la cuenta.
            "
"101","Well it's been a solid few months since my purchase and I've got to say I'm completely satisfied. Works perfectly. Really nice, sleek and feels new. I immediately bought a case and screen protectors so I've had zero problems so far.
            "
"102","I've bought this item to gift one of my very close person. After opening,it was found the Sound is not working, not able to hear any sounds. No Music, Phone rings or any sounds !! Absolutely dissatisfied with this. Need to take this to the Apple store and spend $125 to fix the problem .It created a lot of shame for me for giving such a painful gift to someone. Never buy it from this seller, total waste of money.
            "
"103","Sooo I¡¯m currently writing this from my new iPhone 6s. Before anything I say, it¡¯s important to note that I purchased from Dealfisher. The iPhone came with some minor scratches on the edges, which were covered by a case just fine. The screen is great, no scratches and everything works. I haven¡¯t tried to activate it and get service yet so I¡¯m not sure how that will go, it took my SIM card on the first try though. It came with a generic charger in a generic box. No SIM card removal tool or earphones. I would definitely recommend this product so far.
            "
"104","So far so good.. phone was clean..shopping was as expected. But will write full review over the next few months to make sure all components are lasting..
            "
"105","Phone works well, nothing out of the ordinary not used to the battery life, got mine from bluspry tho I actually ordered from techventure, I do not know if that was due to them having it In stock,overall satisfied with my purchaseUpdate ended up trading that phone for the iPhone 7plus it¡¯s a a better deal in the long run and way more battery
            "
"106","casing was flawless but theres a big indent in the middle of the screen preventing me from putting a screen guard on it without having to look at a huge air bubble. otherwise, it's great. just be sure who you buy from
            "
"107","This phone completely shut off after 3 months of using it. Throughout the night it turned ff and never turned back on Luckily I had an upgrade but thank you amazon for selling me a half working phone.
            "
"108","Phone arrived in good cosmetic condition for a refurbished phone. However, after one week of use the battery lasts about an hour. Sometimes less. We now have to spend more money to get the battery replaced.
            "
"109","the phone came well packaged, but started heating up as soon as i started using it. i lost it few days ago, but i dont really regret it. exterior condition was ok. but a refurbished can be way better, this one was a mess
            "
"110","The phone itself is great. One very annoying thing is not being able to turn off the camera noise. It doesn't seem like a big issue but when you are taking pictures with friends it is extremely annoying. Apparently any phone from japan has this noise unable to be diabled.
            "
"111","I purchased this phone as an upgrade from a 6 plus because my old iPhone had touch disease. I received the 6S and the battery life is garbage. Charges to 65% overnight, and steadily tanks during the day. Good working phone, but a bad battery will kill any review.
            "
"112","Very good iPhone 6s unlocked 64Gb gold colorIs refurbished and unlocked. I was able to use it with an international sim card (an Italian one)The condition outside was perfect. The battery status too...I gave the phone to my father and immediately he thought it was a new phone for himIf I'll find another offer I'll buy another one for sure. Thank you!

"113","Iphone came scratched does not look brand new you can tell iphone has been used... also battery life doesn¡¯t last to long..and the  phone freezes i got my iphone with Breed I would not suggest going with this company
            "
"114","The phone did not work properly. For regular phone calls you could only hear the person you were calling but they couldn't hear you and there was always a lot of static. The Facetime option worked a little. The seller didn't seem too concerned when we contacted her about the issues but we were refunded promptly.
            "
"115","Works
            "
"116","Volume button does not shut off the camera. Battery life came in at 90% And after 26 days it is down to 79%. I am sending it back.
            "
"117","Phone had minor scratches on the back of the case, and a small flaw on the glass front toward an edge so it doesn't affect the display. After a couple of days of almost constant yay-I-got-a-new-phone usage, I detect no problems with battery life or operation. Getting my unlocked phone set up for my provider T-Mobile took an easy five minutes at their store. Seller BREEM shipped the phone with USB charging cord and 110v plug that are not made by Apple, but do their jobs just fine so far.
            "
"118","Phone is horrible. It shakes, calls people randomly and you can¡¯t text. I would never buy a refurbished phone again from this site. So disappointed
            "
"119","It came with the battery at low health so it doesn¡¯t hold a charge all day but overall solid phone the battery has been recognized by apple as a deffect
            "
"120","The entire LCD Screen turned pitch black in 2 days. Could not turn it on/off and completely unresponsive. What a terribly horrible product. I also noticed the back turned hot very quickly before the inexplicable ending of the screen.
            "
"121","The iPhone 6s I got works amazing would definitely recommend it to my friends and it didn¡¯t come with any scratches or any damage it¡¯s practically brand new and this phone works pretty good for whatever you need including gaming.
            "
"122","Battery life isn¡¯t great and the screen came with a couple scratches but otherwise functions perfectly. Can¡¯t expect the world from a refurbished phone. I¡¯m pleasantly pleased with it.
            "
"123","At first I was very skeptical about buying this because 1. The bad reviews will have you worrying if you're getting a broken or unusable phone, and 2. Because it's used/refurbished. But after it came a day earlier and I finished unboxing it, I can say you're getting an extremely solid product, looked brand new, felt amazing, and runs smoothly. Certainly getting your money's worth. Just make sure you get a case along with it if you're a clumsy person like me.
            "
"124","All good thanks
            "
"125","The phone did not last more than an hour using the internet the battery was total garbage other than that there was no scratches on the item but the item was returned

            "
"127","*UPDATE* I went to the Apple store to get my battery replaced, and they wouldn¡¯t touch it, because there was a run down, after market battery installed. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!The battery is totally run down- takes forever to charge, then immediately begins to lose charge. I paid too much money to be sold such a subpar product.
            "
"128","Great product. I received my phone earlier than expected with 87% battery life. I do reccomend this particular company. The phone showed up with no signs of wear, completely factory reset. 10/10 would buy again.
            "
"129","I bought this phone to replace my old one which was the same model. Everything works normally EXCEPT for the inability to shut the camera shutter sound off. I'm not able to respond to my Snapchats in public or at school because everyone hears the loud shutter sound. But other than that, it was an alright deal.
            "
"130","The battery shows a little bit of age, as it doesn't have that fresh long-lasting and quick-charging performance that a new phone has, but otherwise this phone is pristine and fantastic.
            "
"131","The microphone doesn't work well (well talking on the phone it is very muffled), I should have sent it back, but was leaving town for ten days. Disappointed.

            "
"134","At first glance, the phone appeared to be in good condition...As soon as I started making phone calls, I realized the ear piece did not work. I could only make phone calls on speaker phone, because the sound was so quiet.I also noticed the battery life was awful. I would barely use the phone and it would have to be charged 3-4 times a day.

"135","I am really happy with my purchase.
            "
"136","i love it although i will admit i was on edge about buying this product because of all the mixed review i got the 16 gb rose gold by deal fisher the phone look and workes perfectly no scratches on it at all and i was easily able to connect my service to it  hands down will by again if i break this one
            "
"137","Phone itself is great. If I need to buy another phone, I  will buy again from this seller. Battery on the other hand doesn¡¯t last

"138","I could have given this iphone 6s a 4 star, because it arrived dirty, may be it's a refurbished iphone.  The earpiece is hardly audible.  I had to spend hours to clean the dirt off the earpiece. After cleaning the phone, everything seems fine so I decided to keep it for special use.  However, I will not buy another refurbished phone from this vendor (The Platinum Deals).

            "
"141","Bought this phone as a birthday present for my boyfriend. Seems to be overall good phone, good battery life and regular response speed, although it¡¯s unfortunate that the screen has minor problems such as not registering when buttons are held down when recording video it will randomly stop, seems to be a sensor issue. Overall a good phone besides that issue.
            "
"142","very deep scratches!! not as good as it says! hate it! I bought a 5s from another seller and it came as new.

"143","In the past I had iPhones and then switched to an Android.  I'm glad I switched back to an iPhone.  It has been more reliable for me.  I bought an Otter Box case and haven't broken it yet.  The phone was in good condition, and I'm happy with it.
            "
"144","I was skeptical about buying a phone online but it was shipped fast and packaged just fine. It¡¯s in great condition no dings or scratches and so far it works great. This is my first day using it so if anything changes I¡¯ll update.

"145","Love it. A year later and it works oerfectly still. Everything came in great condition. It had the phone and a charger.

"146","I needed a new phone and didn¡¯t want to purchase one brand new through my phone company, so I ordered this one. Luckily I ordered it before reading the reviews because had I seen all the negative feedback I definitely would not have. I am very happy with the phone, works great! Got here in 4 days, Looks brand new, worked as soon as I put my SIM in and came with a screen protector already on.
            "
"147","Very disappointed with the quality of phone. Ringer is not working after few days of use. It goes on Mute even without hitting side Mute Button which means you wont hear ring bell if someone is calling you. This is very bad since it can be very damaging in an emergency situation. I contacted Seller for help with changing the phone but there was NO Reply from the Seller. I strongly recommend not to buy this product again.
            "
"148","I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box , and saw what appeared to be a brand new phone with not a mark on it. I plugged in my Cricket sim card and was on my way.  Very happy with this purchase.
            "
"149","I got my phone and everything seemed perfect about it, until I'd have phone calls and people would say that they could barely hear me. So I tested it out by recording with a lot of background noise, and everything sounds so mumbled and far away. I really need this to be replaced. It's frustrating making important phone calls to my boss and having her tell me we'll talk later because she can't understand me.
            "
"150","The battery died after using about week +. I do not recommend buying the refurbished iPhone unless it's directly from apple.com. I'm going to return it soon!

"152","Refurbished  iPhone 6S delivered must not have been tested prior to sending. Battery life would go from 100% to 0% with less then 1 hour of use. Battery test shows 95% life but would discharge within an hour. Called and customer service did not seem to care and offered $20 or just send it back. Very frustrating since took me a while to move all my apps etc to this phone only to find out that it was a piece of junk.
            "
"153","Phone heats up. Battery defective.

            "
"155","Excellent condition refurbished device. Everything works. No dead pixels. Screen came with a screen protector installed. Very happy with BuySPRY. Unit is like new. No scuffs or scratches.
            "
"156","Vino con detalles esteticos, bateria solo al 70% y La pantalla tiene pequenas machas blancas
            "
"157","Worked great and received as described.
            "
"158","Was kinda lerious at first after ordering and noticing some more of the bad reviews but once I got it it seemed like BRAND new with one very very small scuff mark on the back from setting it on a table perhaps and no scratches on the screen very pleased and arrived 4 days early
            "
"159","I just received my phone and it is BEAUTIFUL! I honestly could not tell if it was refurbished or brand new. The only thing I could find was a couple teeny-tiny scratches on the back- I mean they are so small. The phone arrived in 2 days with standard free shipping! Very happy with this product and will definitely be ordering again!
            "
"160","Can¡¯t beat the price. I bought this iPhone 6s for my wife, it has a giant hard drive of 64 gigs  which she needs for videos and pictures of the kids. Works great!!!
            "
"161","I wanted to wait to give an honest opinion/review. Got this for my daughter because I had one from my job. Arrived in great condition. Seller had a signature resquest upon delivery which was kind of a pain but at the most was the best thing that they could do so that my product was delivered safe and TO ME. So far she still loves it, no issues, or doubts. This was actually loke brand new! I forgot if I ordered a refurbish or brand new phone.... that says a lot!
            "
"162","Love it! It has literally no scratches, it looks brand new and came with a screen proctor on it. I was a little nervous because of the mixed reviews but I couldn¡¯t be happier that I decided to buy it!
            "
"163","Works well as a camera, which is why i bought it. Battery life is a little weak.
            "
"164","I am unable to use cellular data which is a pain. I can only iMessage and use the internet on WiFi. Phone is in good condition and works well otherwise.
            "
"165","We bought this phone in January 2018. We have been having problems out of the battery since may now it doesn¡¯t even come on....
            "
"166","Everything was good, but would have like to have the headphones included.
            "
"167","Bought the phone 2 weeks in and it's still perfect. Everything works. No scratch or dent or wear and tare. Looks brand new, but its refurbish. My daughter loved it. It's exactly what I got through the mail. Unlock and I can use it through tmobile. I've recently bought it off another buyer,it said it was unlock but when I got it phone was not unlock so I had to return it and they gave me a full refund. Other then that, it was a 3 weeks waiting period for the return and the refund.If you're thinking of buying one from this seller, I would recommend it.
            "
"168","The product said to be refurbished. I dont mind the aesthetical details such as dents and scratches but I DO care about receiving a said to be refurbished cellphone that has a battery that lasts only a few hours and even shows in the battery stats to only hold 78% of charge. Having known this i wouldnt have bought it but since i live in Argentina i cant even give it back...i guess i¡¯ll have to spend extra money and buy a new battery.
            "
"169","I was really scared ordering a refurbished phone since the reviews were mixed but I¡¯m really happy!No scratches or anything, the phone starts up perfectly!It even came with a screen protector on the phone along with an Apple cord and charger. So far so good and if this isn¡¯t updated than you¡¯ll know i was happy with the phone :)
            "
"170","Absolutely awesome phone, no complaints. Ordered one more for my sister hope its going to be good as well!
            "
"171","Worked fine for about a  month then started having a lot of trouble with it...lately it just freezes and locks up, the screen stays stuck and i have to do hard resets almost all day. I have no clue whats wrong with it. Really bummed out about it.
            "
"172","Totally impressed with this seller Chubbiestech.  My phone arrived a day early, by certified signature mail.  The box and phone look totally new.  I changed out my sim and.....up and running instantly.  I was not expecting it to include a glass screen cover already placed on screen, a sim removal tool, and a hard case.  I broke my last phone dropping it without a case or screen protector.  These little things mean a lot.
            "
"173","I've had this phone now for 2 months and it works perfectly.  Buying re-furbished saves a lot of money.  I'll never buy new again!  I love it.
            "
"174","Received my iPhone 6s 64 gig this week. I was expecting a few knicks and dings on the phone but to my surprise, it was immaculate. It even came with a free screen protector already installed. works just like a new phone as well, I am a very satisfied customer.. Will definitely be purchasing form Chubbiestech again.
            "
"175","Purchased for my son and the Product was as described. My son is satisfied. However, the battery life doesn¡¯t last as long, but he does keep his charger on hand, (typical teenager) LOL
            "
"176","This product is very good, I had an amazing time with this phone and at a very good price, the phone was phenomenal. As this was my first Iphone I didn't expect much, I only wanted it to make calls and text and the screen to be big enough for my hands. It did all of this and more, I must say that work was very amazingly done on this phone, now if you'd like to know why I gave it one star I will tell you this.The relationship I had with this phone didn't work out. On the first day it worked perfectly fine, on the second day it would overheat and take a moment to come back on. On the third day it did the same thing mulitple times with very little use, on the fourth day it cut off for a few hours with very little work done with it. on the fifth day it cut out entirely and didn't come back on until two days later. Don't buy this product, save your money, buy an android.
            "
"177","It can in pretty nice packaging and the quality of the device is better than I expected. A minor gripe is the battery capacity is 89% which is still completely usable but it would have been nice to get a completely new one for the price
            "
"178","Got it and works but....The screen is all scratched. Finewiththat ifits fine scratches but, two major scratches, deep, on it next to home button. Quite annoying.Last time i go with a refurbished.Get prepared for stuff like this. Refurbished is not what they make it sound to be.
            "
"179","The phone works perfectly. No scratches. Even came with a glass screen protector. The battery is so much better than my old iPhone which tells me this one is fairly new.
            "
"180","As expected.  As new not a single scratch. Unlocked, using it in Europe. Been using it for 2 weeks now everything works fine.  Got it from DealFisher. As mentioned here in other reviews no box and no original accessories but that was expected.
            "
"181","The quality of the phone is like new, no stripes or hits, seems like new.It did not come with headphones and the charger is not original.The battery is not lasting much but that could be an iPhone general issue.The touch of the screen works perfect and in general everything is working as new.
            "
"182","Small problems, overall it works and is worth the price.
            "
"183","I have had this phone for over a year. Could not be more pleased. Have not had a single glitch!
            "
"184","iPhone came in great condition, it comes with a generic charger not the apple brand, but it works perfect. The phone is in great condition and unlocked as advertised.
            "
"185","I bought my iPhone from dealfisher. I paid 250 in total and overall I¡¯m satisfied. It looks like new and the phone itself works properly. The reason I¡¯m giving it four stars is that the battery runs out extremely fast which is probably why the original owner gave it back, but I got what I paid for, so I¡¯m not mad.
            "
"186","The Phone is a refurbished unit, so you can tell it¡¯s not new, but the most notable thing was the battery life.
            "
"187","I purchased this for my niece who lives in Texas.  She says she loves it and it works great for her.  I'm happy!
            "
"188","The phone volume cannot be heard! It exactly stopped in 90 days (just after warranty)
            "
"189","I would rather a 4.5 it is amazing works perfectly except it has not been sending me I message notifications. Other than that no complaintsEdit: now it has started sending notifacations so my review has been changed to 5 stars
            "
"190","All these bad reviews are a mixture of sellers! Pay attention to the Seller! I ordered from ChubbiesTech and literally no scratches no negativity whatsoever. Just don¡¯t waste your time reading other reviews! Seriously order from ChubbiesTech. I love my Rose Gold IPhone! GET YOU ONE!
            "
"191","Bought this for my daughter.  Phone came like new and was setup in minutes.
            "
"192","Nice refurbishing job but the battery is a little weak.  Doesn't hold a charge very long.
            "
"193","Looks and works like new. The charger failed and I contactedthe vendor and they immediately sent me a new one and a gift ofApple headphones. Great service.
            "
"194","I noticed a lot of bad reviews that made me skeptical to buy. I did buy from them and my phone was exactly what I was expecting from a refurbished phone, looks brand new! There is a little scratch beside the ear jack, but it's not noticeable unless you really look for it.
            "
"195","Battery health was 60% full when fully charged. Battery needs to be replaced,
            "
"196","excellent equipment and I arrive earlier than planned
            "
"197","It¡¯s an unlocked iphone, just know you get an aftermarket charger and no head phones, but the phone works.
            "
"198","This phone was great at first but six months down the line the battery dies in an hour or two.
            "
"199","Exelente oferta equipo completamente sin detalle los recomiendo
            "
"200","Love it So far. Only wish the keyboard were adjustable
            "
"201","I was very skeptical to buy a refurbished phone for my daughter, based on the mixed reviews. I got mine from ""Chubbiestech"" and it was delivered on schedule. Phone looked great with no scratches or dings. Worked perfectly.... Restored from my earlier icloud backup, updated IMEI with my carrier and I was all set. Recommend this seller.
            "
"202","At first I was nervousss but when it finally came i was impressed....it looked almost brand neww...there's only a small scratch on the top but that's fine...the touch works great easy to set up and ofc it came unlocked as it said
            "
"203","I received the phone and the back camera was blurry to start. Then shortly after- maybe a week- the battery life was low and often cut out while displaying percentages of greater value than 10%. Finally, after continued use, the phone cut off and displayed a restoration demand, and upon doing so through iTunes, it repetitively asked for it.
            "
"204","My wife loves the phone so much she can't get enough of it.
            "
"205","This phone arrived in working order and in good condition. Very pleased
            "
"206","100% recommended
            "
"207","Nice phone
            "
"208","I purchased this iphone 6s back in February 2018. Started having static in making calls ever since to the point that callers or I can not hear each other. Also the battery started draining around the same time. Apple store told that the phone had been repaired 4 times for microphone issues in the past. Not sure if I¡¯ll buy again from Mango wireless.
            "
"209","We sent it back after 2 weeks since it stopped charging
            "
"210","phone was not unlocked
            "
"211","The phone itself came in great condition physically speaking, but everything else was terrible I could not use my SIM card in it at all. The screen wouldn¡¯t let me touch it until I turned the phone off then on again. And then it wouldn¡¯t let me sign in to the apple store even though I changed my password and did everything right.
            "
"212","Speakers don¡¯t work.  No headphones.  Terrible.  Never buy tech from amazon again.
            "
"213","Nice phone - came with very little sign of former ownership!
            "
"214","Got the iPhone 6s Rose Gold! LOVE IT!!!! Works perfectly, just like brand new. Came in an white refurbished box, and has absolutely no scratches.. its just like i bought it brand new from the apple store.
            "
"215","this iPhone came good as new right out the box it had no scratched, scuffs anywhere on the device and functions as it's supposed to.
            "
"216","The battery did not last more than a few months. This phone was only used for wifi while at home so nothing overly demanding. The charger sent with the phone was non-functional as well. This would have been a good price point if I hadn't has these issues.
            "
"217","Theres not much to say about iphones at this point. The product is in perfect condition and complies with the description provided by the seller. It came in a generic box which is to expect in refurbished items. However the description should also state that the accesories provided are not originals. The charger is very cheap, it didn't came with earplugs, but for this price it's something you can overlook.
            "
"218","I love my phone, it have a little details on the behind part, but the functionality is excellent !And completely unlocked I am In USA and I am using a SIM from Mexico.
            "
"219","Was in upgrade.  Love it
            "
"220","This broke 2 months after I got it and I ended up purchasing a brand new one from the AT&T store.  I was super disappointed.  I will not purchase a refurbished one again.  Just my opinion.
            "
"221","This is a great phone at a great price. Be sure to buy from a highly rated seller.
            "
"222","I am happy with my new phone. Delivery was prompt and everything met my expectations.
            "
"223","the phone came in excellent condition . very happy with purchase
            "
"224","Worked like new. Bought it for my sister. She is still using it with no problems at all
            "
"225","The iPhones came on time and were in excellent condition, three problems though. (1) I bought three phones and only two chargers came, (2) one charger dock was black and looked like it was not a third but a fourth or fifth party charger. (3) None of the phones came with the sim card tool. I think my <U+2B50><U+FE0F> <U+2B50><U+FE0F> <U+2B50><U+FE0F>  rating is pretty generous.
            "
"226","Seemed to work perfectly well for first month until the screen became unresponsive but with random button pressing for no apparent reason.
            "
"227","Do not purchase. The battery was faulty and after many attempts to receive my money, even after sending in, calling several times, and providing the tracking number- I have received no response. I am very disappointed in Amazon and Apple for allowing this.
            "
"228","<U+00A0>3 tiny itty bitty scratches but other than that I love it and saved alot of money great job keep it up!
            "
"229","This is what happens when you get a second-hand repaired cellphone. Sometimes youre lucky, sometimes you're not. The battery is completely toast. It says fully charged and a few minutes later it's low battery. Not good. I am returning it for a refund.
            "
"230","My son has had this phone for a little over a week and so far no problems. It works just as it's supposed to.
            "
"231","Like new!
            "
"232","Mega like! Excellent product. Very Complete. Good price!
            "
"233","Hi, I recently purchased this product (iphone 6s 64gb space gray) and found out that the battery runs out unusually quickly. For example, I lost 20% of battery in just a 15 minute car ride. I am requesting a partial refund, otherwise I will have to return the product and get a full refund. Please get back to me in one business day so I can resolve this problem, thanks.
            "
"234","So thankful this was totally unlocked and was easy to transfer old phone stuff to this phone (same size SIM card, so it was an easy swap).
            "
"235","The battery came showing 87% of life use...that¡¯s strange for me, I thought the battery are supposed to be replaced for a new one when the product is refurbished.
            "
"236","overheats, freezes, restarts and has bad battery. the only thing this thing is good at; its taking pictures
            "
"237","It had some dents and was scratched a lot, but it is okay for the price you are paying. It is not sim locked too. The battery life sucked though
            "
"238","Good phone for the price, with small battery faults at 81% battery, but it works well and is unlocked
            "
"239","Phone works like a charm, looks like new (There's a small scratch on the screen but hardly noticeable). The phone is unlock and comes with a blue cable and charger. I've just got it 2 days ago though. Will come back later for update.
            "
"240","i regret buying it
            "
"241","Phone looked ok, but it only lasted about 2 weeks! It went completely dead. I took it to apple store, they said it was not battery like most iPhone 6, and it was not repairable. I¡¯ll never buy a phone online again!
            "
"242","My phone is completely unlock which was my biggest concern because I¡¯m in Panama , but in the other hand it has this defects shown in the picture , So I¡¯m not completely happy with my purchase but it works
            "
"243","I bought this from amazon. I tried to return this as it was not detecting network
            "
"244","This iPhone is not unlocked. Just bought this product and it does not work with my carrier in Brazil. What a shame!
            "
"245","Totally lived up to expectations. Way to go Apple!!!
            "
"246","The phone came with a lot of issues and no one can help me to solve my situation. There isn¡¯t a refound section and I can¡¯t talk to anyone. I have weeks trying to do something
            "
"247","I received the phone not worked and this isn¡¯t fair you say ref but working good I recived phone not worked I advise everyone thinking to buy any something from this seller back don¡¯t buy from himPhone not working and to return it will be cost me 143 $ to shipping it
            "
"248","I bought 3 of these phones all 3 needed battery replaced in the first year.  On phone had to be replaced in the first year and another phone could not have apple change battery because it did not have the battery clips in the phone.
            "
"249","After several attempts with other providers that were more than disappointing...This phone arrived quickly and virtually indistinguishable from a brand new phone. Inserted NANO SIM card it activated right up and works just great. Battery is also performing like new as well. Highly recommended, thank you.
            "
"250","Battery was done a few weeks after purchase, touch screen didn't respond much at all. Only good thing was it looked good cosmetically.
            "
"251","Battery dies three times a day. Not happy after only having it since end of February.
            "
"252","This phone is exactly as nice as we expected. It seems ""like new"" and everything works fine.
            "
"253","Phone did not work at all! Took it to get looked at and wasn't even a real iPhone it was made in China. Horrible!
            "
"254","I usually buy used phones and I know that some you'll have to return. I'm keeping this one, just bummed that the battery usually needs to be charged twice a day and I don't use it all that much.
            "
"255","I have a battery problem and I have to replace it. And it turns out that the phone is from Japan and you can¡¯t shut the camera shutter off. So good luck if like Me, you don¡¯t like sounds on your phone; they should have point that on the specifications
            "
"256","i love it works perfectly only thing is i ordered the rose gold and got the gold but no big deal im still really happy
            "
"257","The phone came out of the Apple box with a different charger. There was also a scratch on it.
            "
"258","Thanks

"259","So far so good! We will see in the long run.
            "
"260","just fine, i love this phone, i got the SE 16 gb and now this with 64 gb, just fine
            "
"261","My father loved it but it looked like used phone
            "
"262","Product works 100% as it should. Has the memory that is specified and functionality is exactly how it should be. It is unlocked as many people want and it does work out of the US.However, it came full of scratches all over the screen, it¡¯s a pitty.
            "
"263","The phone came the next day after ordering and was in perfect condition which was awesome! All data from my daughter's old phone was downloaded successfully.  Very happy with this purchase.
            "
"264","Certified refurbished does not get tech support from Apple ...The battery life¡¯s severely diminished in 90 days and now I am stuck with an iPhone that functions with limited battery life .. Apple will not sell an adequate battery due to it being refurbished by non Apple parts
            "
"265","Great buy. It came in a normal box with an apple charger. I was little suspicious because of all th bee reviews but this phone is perfect so far. It works great. It looks brand new.
            "
"266","Horrible.will return it
            "
"267","I received my phone earlier today and I am already loving it!!! This phone accepted my sims card without any issues. I transferred my backup info and it took without a hitch. I definitely would recommend this phone from this buyer. In case you guys are wondering, I am using this phone with a go phone plan. Totally worth it!
            "
"268","The phone has had nothing but problems since we received it. Have brought back to the Apple and Verizon store several times seem to say things are operating, but shuts off without warning does not  except calls or text intermittently and touchscreen does not always operate. Seller has not responded to increase
            "
"269","Was in like new condition daughter is very happy with it
            "
"270","I¡¯m very happy with these phone, on time and it is like new, thanks
            "
"271","Great looking phone.  I can hear fine but all a person hears on the other end sounds like I'm talking through a pillow. Speakerphone was temporary work-around at home but its not going to work in public.Apparently not as ""certified"" as it can get. Going back for more refurb.
            "
"272","My phone came in a day earlier than it was supposed to so that¡¯s a plus. The phone itself works great I haven¡¯t had any problems with it. It has some small dings on it but nothing that is unacceptable. Mine also came with a screen protector as well, overall I¡¯m really glad I made this purchase!
            "
"273","Product was not efficient, and was not ready to be sold. Product kept glitching and malfunctioning.
            "
"274","Worth to buy... good battery life... and it looks new
            "
"275","Great phone, great price. No issues
            "
"276","Ugh! Words cannot describe how happy I am with this phone! It worked with my network (us cellular) after reading some bad reviews I was so worried I was going to get something bad! But I love this phone! It is flawless. No scratches. Great battery and beautiful in color. 5/5 stars!
            "
"277","Bueno lo recomiendo
            "
"278","i ordered the iphone 6s rose gold for my girlfriend and it said it was supposed to come in two weeks because they didnt have anymore but then it said it was coming in two days later when i ordered it. i was so happy! Great product.
            "
"279","I have the phone and the lock/unlock button is pretty hard. Their replacement policy is bad
            "
"280","So far so good. A gift for my Grandson. He loves it
            "
"281","Honestly this was more than i was expecting. The phone does have a deep scratch in the glass but you can barely see it. Also some scratchs on back. They gave a screen cover and a i love nyc phone case. Cute. We will see how the phone works for the next few days. Battery is good.
            "
"282","The phone battery drains in 2 hrs .I am so disappointed with the phone .I am travelling and I have promised my friend a phone from USA otherwise I would have returned this phone .
            "
"283","Good
            "
"284","I¡¯ve had a great experience with the product. Looks and worked like it was brand new when I got it. I was a little hesitant with all the 1 star reviews to purchase, but the product I recieved was in great condition. I assume that more or less came down to luck of the draw, but mine works perfectly.
            "
"285","works well
            "
"286","The phone a nice phone when it first arrived then after 3 months the battery started having a shorter life and shorter and shorter until now on this day it will not turn on so now I guess I have to take it to a Apple expert for repairs not at all what I expected

"708","I am loving my iPhone 6s. I used to have a 16gb 6s that I gave to my dad. I wanted a good phone as a replacement with more memory. I didn't want to pay the premium for the iPhone 7 or go into a debt plan with my phone provider. So I decided to get a refurbished phone from BuySPRY. The phone was in excellent condition, not one scratch it looks brand new, the screen is perfect. The packaging was in a nice plastic case with accessories. It's working wonderfully and good battery life. I could have bought a second hand phone from Craigslist but not for much cheaper and the convenience of Amazon and the 90 day warranty is fantastic. I'm very happy with my purchase.

            "
"821","I've had iphones for 5 years, never used cases, never broke one. This one had a minor fall that produced 2 hairline fractures at the top of the screen but this somehow disabled the whole touch pad. I took it to our local repair shop and they said that they could tell the screen had been replaced before and with a low quality class. That probably explains why I was always pocket-dialing and cheek-muting. With the new screen and casing I bought it is working better than ever.

"893","Got this a deal of the day for a great price.  The phone looks wonderful, except for one small scratch on the front near the front-facing camera.  That scratch is very small and only visible from certain angles.  I use the Battery Life app on my phone and the battery in the phone that I received tests out at 100%, so no issues with the battery.  I was a little leery of buying a used phone, but this phone has exceeded my expectations, especially at the price I paid.  I would buy from this seller again.

Even though it is certified refurbished you could not tell it from a new phone in any way. Got a little better charging cord than with new phone. It will charge two devices at a time where factory cord will only do one.

Won't work with my other off-brand charger or an apple brand charger (I tried both chargers with my old phone at the same time and they worked perfectly.)  Really disappointed, especially because I'd already put a glass screen protector on it and now I have to return it.

            "
"1051","For this price, I expected the phone to at least be cleaned... there was a huge smudge mark on the apple (which easily came off by rubbing) and the headphone jack was almost black due to dust. I have never had a refurbished product that was not cleaned...I was not expecting a brand new phone  but those small things make a big difference. I am a little grossed out so will be returning the product.

"1063","Since I bought the phone there are connection problems. Sometimes it says ""NO SERVICE"", sometimes in the middle of conversation the network disappears. I've checked with different carriers in different locations, but the same problems appear. It is obviously a phone defect I can't used this phone normal.

"1092","They sent me a Japanese model iPhone (mkqq2j/a) which has the camera shutter sound permanently ON no matter what you do (mute button, volume, any type of setting, etc.). In Japan, it is illegal to have a silent camera just in case you are going to take pictures of people that they don't want taken. Of course there are ways around this like Jailbreaking the phone, but I don't want to have to do that. I want a regular US of A phone. Or really from any other country that doesn't require a loud shutter every time you take a picture or take a screenshot.I gave 2 stars based on the wrong model being sent. Not on the phone itself which is great and scratch free. I will raise the stars if they send me a correct one.EDIT:They (Magic Mobile Partners) wrote back to tell me that they will let me return the phone, but if they replace it it the next one COULD STILL BE A JAPANESE VERSION! This is ridiculous and could be solved if they look through their phones and check the model numbers to make sure they are selling US versions to US folks. I'll take my business elsewhere.

"1093","After breaking my phone on an amusement park ride, I was desperate for a new phone. Verizon wouldn't help even with insurance and I was too afraid to buy from a private seller. This phone came in PERFECT condition. SO happy with it! To any of you worried to buy one of these like I was...do it.
            "
"1094","Love it
            "
"1095","Had  a scratch on the screen and some color problems on the back, so as some white dots at the back you can't remove. But besides that it works great. The charger was broken, so it got a defect. While the phone was charging it did not work and act by itself. But still good for the price.
            "
"1096","Bought phone in May 2017.  Completely stopped working in January 2018.  Went to apple store, but they were unable to do anything.  Do not use this seller.  They sell unreliable merchandise.

"1099","I purchased this phone and it wouldn't not work and after spending hours on the phone with Apple, US Cellular and then Amazon tech support it was concluded that it didn't work.  Thankfully I purchased through Amazon because they took care of it.  I was able to return it for free with a full refund.  I hope the next phone works.

"1109","I bought the phone, and not even after a week of use, the phone when it was about 10- 5% would just turn it off and when I put it on the charger sometimes didn't even charge, so I got a new charger and try to use different plugs in my house and nothing change. I'd have to let the phone charge the whole night without using it.

            "
"1112","Only problem is with hearing when people call me. It's not good at all. For the price we pay, the phone should come as close as brand new. Now I will have to pay another company tho see what's wrong with the hearing part (more money), because I am all the way across the ocean (Angola), therefore I can't send it back to the US. Plus, it was a gift for my mom.SAD!

"1122","The phone worked great for about two months. Then, it shut off overnight and will not turn back on. I never received my phone protection plan via mail or email.

"1123","Arrived when it was suppose to, the phone was unlocked as said. No scratches or anything. I'm really pleased only thing is the battery seems to die fast and I'm hoping it won't be a huge problem for me.
            "
"1124","I love this phone. It looks exactly like the picture. I just din't like how it won't work unless it has a SIM card, but I'm getting that tomorrow so it is fine. There was no damages, and it works fine so far with what I am able to do. I would definitely  recommend.

"1127","I bought my phone from the seller Southwest Electronics. It came with a sticker on the back that said ""verizon"", I was horrified and scared that the phone would not be unlocked. But fourtunatly it was a only a stupid sticker.The first time I connected my phone to the network it had some issues and made a lot of noises, but it lasted a couple seconds. It now works wonderful and I'm super happy with my purchase.
            "
"1128","This is overall a great product and I'm really happ with the phone. It's fast, no glitches, doesn't even look refebished. The only flaw was the tiny little white specks when the screen was on but it was dark enough to see. There weren't a lot and even me as a perfectionist wasn't bothered by it. I wish the screen was a tiny bit bigger because I'm a girl and my hands aren't small but aren't gigantic and I feel like they're a little too big for this screen and I still make a lot of typing errors because of that. Other than that the phone works great and hasn't failed me.
            "
"1129","The item received is 2 yr old and out of the warranty period. This is not a refurbished from apple.

"1151","I was excited to receive my iPhone 6s in the mail just a few days after ordering it! It looked next to new with only 1 or 2 tiny blemishes. Although a week or less after beginning to use it, it already started having battery/shut-off issues. It randomly turns off (inconsistently and without warning) at around 30% battery usage left. It's also turned off suddenly when I was mid-text or about to use the camera. I've requested a return and am very disappointed. I'm not sure that I should order another refurbished iPhone or not. I wish I had a better experience from this one but for as little of time that I've had it & is already having serious  issues.

You have a very satisfied customer!

I am just hoping now that the return goes smoothly.

"1215","Bought it from ""Prime Mobility"" seller, because he's working with Amazon and i've got it in less than 20h.I've got the phone without any dents or scratches. It looks like brand new. When i checked internal status, it showed me the age of phone is about 900 days. Battery showed 70% of health. Fair enough. Of course i didn't expect to get the brand new phone for this bargain price. Who wants t get completely new - just go to apple store. After the tests i've found only the battery has the issue. I mean it worked well but it was the first candidate for repair. Decided to find closets shop and replace it. Accidentally stopped at near apple store and asked them about repair price. They checked my S/N and told me that replacement will be free for me! After 1h i've got brand new phone!So i'm very satisfied by my phone.

"1216","There is nothing so special in this phone that people are mad after it. Apple is only popular because of Brand value, not for manufacturing products.For the pros part-Great colour (Rose Gold)DurableGood speed (not great)CompactBeneficial 3d touchNow let us talk about the cons-Screen colours are not vibrantProcessor is not the fastestHangs sometimesAnd if you don't believe me, check on internet that the study in true that after you buy an Apple device, they slowly and steadily slow down your phone by major and minor software update. So be aware!! An update is not always for good.The biggest Con-The camera is very blurry and bad.I hate its camera.More info about the fourth con-This is not a rumor, a complete and accurate study and only Apple is this clever to force you to buy their only by name flagships. Other companies like Samsung are honest and never do this bad practice. In other flagships, after around 20 months, the phone feels a bit on the slower side because the processor gets old by the time.Enough talking for today.And again this is my honest review and not any practice of degrading Apple. Please click the helpful button below the review.I have just upgraded to note 8. No comparison at all!And this Apple never by any means worth your kidney!!Have a nice day.
            "
"1217","This product was absolutely horrible!! I ended up getting one in September and the battery drained super fast and it was very laggy. I returned it and then I got one in early December and the battery would drain very fast right out of the box. It would heat up very warm when charging for some reason and also ended up having just 16gb in it while I paid for 64. I went on vacation with it and when I got back it wouldn¡¯t turn on no matter how much I charged it or tried hard resets. I checked for water damage but the phone was flawless in appearance and didn¡¯t seem to have problems from a glance. I even used a lifeproof case and took perfect care of it!! My family thinks it is just me who ruins phones and goes through them fast but all of my iPads from actual Verizon STORES work flawlessly. It is AMAZON!!! I will NEVER buy an iPhone from amazon again!!!
            "
"1218","The first apple product that I have ever gotten, was the iphone 6 S. The iphone 6 S is a cellular device created by apple. It is the sixth phone in its generation and is the upgraded version of the iphone 6. The phone comes with a 3D touch HD retina display made from the strongest glass on any iphone. This model also introduces for the first time ever, live photos. Live photos captures a photo in movement so it can be seen still and in motion. I purchased the 6 S, because it has great camera quality and allowed me to do group messaging as well as facetime with anyone else that has an apple device.The main strengths of the product is the camera quality, updates, and phone size. The camera quality of the iphone 6 S went from an ordinary 8 megapixel camera to 12 megapixels that really makes the photo come to life. The live photo helps to capture in motion pictures to get every detail of a photo in that moment. Every couple of months to a year, there is a new update that adds added effects to the device itself. Better apps, emojis, and special messaging features may be given. Right now the highest update at the moment is ios 10. Ios 10 features new advancements in the phone, such as games within imessage, 3D emojis,and more ways to explore apps.The iphone 6 S comes in two sizes, iphone 6 S and iphone 6 S plus. The regular iphone 6 S has a 4.7 in. display, while the iphone 6 S plus has a 5.5 in. display. Each phone comes with fingerprint unlock technology that unlocks the phone and make purchases within a just touch of a finger.The main weaknesses of the product is the small storage space, unavailability of downloading directly onto the phone, and poor battery life. All apple products have an internal memory drive that is connected to the cloud. When the storage space is full, you either have to upgrade your storage, or delete files. Since the storage is internal, it is regulated by apple. According the iphone policy anything that is not available through the app store, cannot be added onto the device. Foreign things such as music, games, etc. cannot be downloaded. Everything must be downloaded off of the app store and things such as music, must be streamed through 3rd party apps or on the web browser. Poor battery life has remained consistent within the apple company through generations. Since the battery is also internal, damaged batteries are hard to replaced, so if damaged must be taken to a shop to be replaced or fixed. Iphone battery life lasts well for the first couple months or years, but after that constant use and abuse leaves the battery weak and causes it to drain more easily.For the conclusion, iphones reign superior within its camera quality, as for androids which have a lack for good quality. Innovation within the company apple has made this product one of the most advanced in its class. Technologies such as live photo, fingerprint scanning, as well as siri give it an undeniable advantage over competitors. Apples iphone 6 S gets a review of about 9/10 for its great commitment to innovation.

"1219","Bought this from US but for use in India. Received the phone in unlocked condition.Second day, the phone turned off unexpectedly. Restarted multiple times, however it goes off in about 5 seconds though 30% battery charge is left.DIAGNOSIS=========Took the phone to nearby Apple Store. Learnt that Iphone 6s manufactured in Sept-Oct 2015 had a known manufacturing defect with battery.ACTION======Got the battery replaced free of cost as the products from above mentioned timeline are eligible for free battery replacement. Lucky me!Also got the phone serial number verified from Apple Store. Realized that it was Verizon locked before, however in unlocked condition now. So not a problem.======All in all, phone looks nice to me - no scratches or dents. Looks decently new.

"1220","The first one I received had a chip in the screen. The second one I¡¯ve received I cannot make calls with because I cannot hear other individuals unless they are on speaker and when on speaker they can¡¯t hear me. Also the phone randomly shuts off when I¡¯m trying to do stuff on it.

"1226","After my old iPhone 6s stopped working well, I knew I needed another phone. I was looking online, and I saw that refurbished phones were much cheaper than new ones. I really love the 6s, so I looked at this, and found that this really is the best option. The screen seems brand new, and the battery was new as well. I absolutely love the phone.

"1227","Bought 2 of these phones to replace a 4s and a 5s and they look like new and work great.  Plus I bought a 2 year SquareTrade warranty to go with them.  Can't go wrong! Plus I received it a day sooner than I expected! Fast shipping!

"1263","The phone I received looks brand new. No scratches or anything like that, you can't even tell it's refurbished. Everything works great, and it was unlocked like it said, it worked with a t-mobile sim card to set up in my case. The only issue I have noticed that I have seen others comment on is the battery life. The battery doesn't seem to last that long, and it will sometimes get stuck on a certain number, then when it becomes ""unstuck"" it will drop anywhere from 5-10% in under a minute. Very odd. I have also noticed this happen when using the Camera and Snapchat. I'm not sure if this is an issue with the 6s itself, or if it is just the phone I've received, but I use my phone heavily throughout the day and have had to charge it about 3 times a day. When I first received the phone, I charged it fully before using it. When I used it, it updated iOS and I also transferred all of my stuff from iCloud, this dropped the battery significantly, to around 30%. Weird thing was, when I rebooted it, it went back up to 64%? It was weird, but I haven't been having that issue since that one time, just a bad battery life IMO.
            "
"1264","Phone arrived timely and in condition promised.  It's a perfectly cute and functioning Rose Gold iPhone 6S.  I have had no technical issues with this phone.  It has gone non-responsive and had to be restarted maybe twice since it arrived, but that was when my daughter was playing games on REALLY jenky apps, and I really think it was an app issue, NOT the device.  When she's not using shady apps it works perfectly.  The device has been just fine so far.  Of course, it's been only a few weeks.  This was much more affordable than buying a device from AT&T and it was a risk that has so far paid off.

"1265","I got this phone from bluetek after my iphone SE was water damaged. To avoid a reoccurance, I got a lifeproof case for this. Phone appeared fine at first, but within the first use it was apparent that the battery was bad. When I updated to the current iphone software as forced by apple, it got  worse. Once the battery reached 70% it had to be on a charger to use any apps.Prior to the SE I had prior to this phone, I had another 6S that was a year old. I was the only owner. It also crashed within a week of upgrading my apple software, but it became entirely ununsable.When I took my new case off to return the phone (the one from Bluetek seller,) the phone screen was separating from the back.

"1266","I am in love with my new iPhone. Works like new, the battery is excellent with no bad wear there is absolutely no scratches on the phone. I would recommend not upgrading to iOS 10 because it does drain your battery faster. There is no headphones included, just the phone and lightening wire and adapter that isn't from apple. I recommend getting a screen protector and a transparent shock absorbing case if you wanna show off like me.

"1267","OLYMPICWIRELESS- originally purchased an Amazon renewed aka refurbished iPhone 6s Immediately I noticed scratches which was quite obvious sign of usage. In description it said no to minimal sign of wear but it was bit more than minimal in my opinion. Secondly, phone got really hot within minutes when I was setting up the iPhone. Not warm, but hot!! I didn¡¯t bother troubleshooting and just packed it up and went back for a refund.chubbiestech- I immediately ordered the identicalPhone for same price from this seller the day I shipped out the defected phone. Phone arrives from New York a lot quicker than expected which was nice. Upon opening, I was very pleased with very clean, almost new looking phone. Well, I found a tiny little black sticker near the charging port that said the word ¡°void¡±. But I figured it was maybe a phone that had charging issue prior to getting refurbished. I totally ignored that and I was really excited and thought I found a good phone for great deal. I set it up and charged and started using when it was 95% charged. I watched fewClips on youtube and surfed the internet via WiFi for maybe little over an hour. To my surprise, my battery went 95 down to 15 and quickly down to 3%. I knew to check my battery health in iOS setting. Picture attached basically shows almost full battery taking a dive down to empty within an hour. I am really confused why battery wasn¡¯t inspected? You would think that since the phone is being refurbished, the battery would be the first thing that they inspect? No. Chubbiestech didn¡¯t. I get in touch with chubbiestech regarding the situation and asked that I receive partial refund as I am going to be needing to replace the battery and spend time out of my day to do so. My request was reasonable as the phone did not meet the description expected. I was granted to be reimbursed only if I can get a receipt from the Apple store which is far enough I have to take time off work to do so. I insisted and told the seller I may just need to goto a phone repair store near by because seller had no intention to consider my time I am spending on their mistake. Well, there was no discussion after that because I just decided to pay $35 of my own money to get battery replaced by phone repair store near where I live. Technician opened my iPhone and asked if the phone was mine that just needed a battery replaced. Told him it was a refurbished phone and he immediately checked to see if it was a stolen phone. ¡°Phew¡± it was not a stolen phone. After, he opens the phone and tells me that the phone does not seem to have been refurbished at all as all original parts are present and no sign of ever opening the phone. So I am wondering if this seller even did a simple inspection. Of course, that¡¯s just my assumption but the truth is, phone was defected and I am obviously not happy about spending my own money fixing the seller¡¯s bad business ethics.I got lucky to have received a phone that only had battery issues. All in all, after replacing the battery my phone works just fine. But I do not suggest you purchase from the seller I mentioned above. Happy shopping!

"1268","Just got the phone, came a lot early than expected, thanks!I was a bit worried about buying preowned, I have to admit... but the phone arrived just like new. Almost no signs of previous use.

I'll start using it right now if something goes wrong, I'll update this review right away. Got it by Electronic Deals.

"1269","This phone came in great shape and has met all of my needs. I had to go online to learn of all of the capabilities of this phone and I am still learning new things about it.

It's a great deal.. very happy with it.

"1271","So I am really impressed with this phone. The case it came in was pretty dirty. It would have been nice if they would have wiped it down before shipping it. But the phone itself was pretty perfect. Super clean and not one scratch. I was able to put my AT&T SIM card in it and update the software and then basically plug it into my ITunes and put the saved backup from the phone I was replacing it on this phone. It has worked perfectly!

"1272","This iPhone 6s that came from the seller ""MyWit"" looks like a brand new iPhone 6s. Had no scratches on the body or the screen and had no dents. All you have to do is turn the phone on and inserted the SIM card and setup the activation within 5 minutes. Really easy setup. The phone is great. I'm satisfied with this purchase! This was unlocked. It did work for Walmart Family Mobile (T-Mobile).

"1274","I purchased my first refurbished iPhone recently, which arrived on time and was aesthetically in great shape. Unfortunately, the battery life of the phone is awful. The phone is at 100% when I arrive to school at 8am, but it loses 70% of the battery life before lunch (and I only use it between classes). The remaining 30% doesn't even last through lunch. Additionally, the screen does not respond with a screen protector, so I had to remove it. AND it freezes up at times so I am forced to hard reset at least once a week .
            "
"1275","While watching a video on MTV yesterday (Sat. 07/15/2017), the screen gradually started changing color from the edges, shutting down towards the the edges.

"1277","Phone worked fine until early January (2 months after purchase).  Started having problems with not hearing the other party on phone calls.  Reset ""all"" which seemed to fix it for a couple weeks.  In February started having problem that other phone call party couldn't hear me off and on.  Resetting did not help.I was (and still am) out of the country so could not return the phone.  Went to an Apple service center in Oslo Norway who said the on-board microphone was bad which meant replacing the entire inside of the phone.  I will not be back in the U.S. until August.  Don't know what I can do.

"1278","I could not be happier to finally have an iphone - this came with the pink case and I am just in love with this phone  - the only thing I did not know but found out quite quickly is that it takes its own sim card and the sim card from an android does not fit - so I did have to go to my carrier's store and have them put in new card and reload phone with my information.  I watched tutorial on line and got what I needed.  I still go back to that when I need to learn something else.It is a great phone and totally refurbished and perfect -Thank you

"1279","Received iph 6S after 9-10 days wait and when I started configuring the iphone  and after completing the updates , I freaked out when the screen displayed Remote Management  - Hill- Rom, Inc will automatically configure and manage your phone. and then on next it displayed a message saying invliad phone.  when I googled, Hill-Rom, Inc., is a company that makes hospital beds, furniture. This is something I was not expecting to receive a company locked Invalid phone.  The Iphone was also getting hot. I printed returned mailing label and the phone is on the way back to the dealer VIP Outlet.
            "
"1280","I bought this from DealFisher. It arrived very professionally, nice box, and the plastic sheet covering the front and back. There were no scratches and looked brand new. But then I noticed I could see some of the LED internal light peaking out through the screen. So it was a new screen, that wasn't glued all the way on, or it was the original screen popping out from a swollen battery. I never checked the battery life/cycles. I was replacing my Iphone 5 that had a swollen battery pushing the screen out, so I definitely didn't want a repeat when buying a replacement. Not sure if it was just a bad copy.
            "
"1281","The iphone bought as refurbished was I believe a new phone in appearance and works just great ,I had a need to connect to speak with some one at Kiss Electronic and was blown away at how well they treat you as a customer.I am very happy with Iphone 6s i purchased it works well and connected to my wireless carrier right away , if ever I can patronize this vendor in the future I will I am also glad that there are still some good vendors out there .
            "

"1283","Defective! The phone had continually shuts itself off and on, the screen changes colors and gets lines in it. I have attempted to contact the seller without response. I will be sending the phone back and expect a full refund! The only reason it got one star of because it wouldn't allow me to submit the review without a rating <U+0001F621> My granddaughter worked and paid for this phone

"1284","Great price and phone looks like new! So far no issues and phone works great. Definitely recommend it**update: switching cell phone provider and find out phone is lock not as described (unlock) was told by the seller to call Apple to get unlock but why should I call Apple when he described it as unlock. Now I'm returning phone and leave my daughter phone less until I get a new phone.

"1286","We have had an iPhone 6 and a 6s in our family.  Both have been poor performers.  Their antenna must be poor quality, as their reception is consistently worse that even our old 5s and SE's.  In addition, they succumb to Apple's battery life scandal.  I would avoid this model of iPhone studiously.  The SE works much better, with the same camera as the 6s.
            "
"1287","I understand that this is a refurbished item but feel that it is a bit overpriced considering that the battery is useless and needs to be replaced.  I would have thought that the refurbishing process would have taken that into account, nope. I think the asking price should be $245 considering the cost to replace the batteries for these phones. This review might be a little bit premature but I feel that I needed to make sure that people buying these take into account that you will probably be spending another $30 for a new battery.  So far everything seems to be in working order but I have just received the item and have yet to thoroughly test it.  Using it on T-Mobile and LTE speeds are decent
            "
"1288","We bought a ""certified refurbished"" Apple 6s phone for our daughter a few months ago from Kiss Electronics and it has been a nightmare.  The phone plays japanese music on it's own at times and the camera sound cannot be muted because it was from Japan (we know this because of the J in the serial number) and that sound comes on by itself and can't be muted.  She just bought another iphone 7 refurbished from Apple this time and is very happy.  I will never buy from Kiss again!  It might have been certified but not by Apple.  Few hundred bucks down the drain.
            "
"1289","This was an Amazon Prime purchase and for some reason the time estimate said it was going to arrive in 4 days. But then it did end up arriving quicker than that estimate. So this caused unnecessary worrying on our part...  but as far as the phone itself, it¡¯s perfect!  Time will tell if it develops the same problem our other 64Gb 6s developed (screen blanking out but the phone was still ¡°alive¡±.).  Hopefully not. We really love the form factor of this phone and the processing speed (for the $)

So I appreciate this seller for providing all original accessories.

"1292","Item like the seller description. Not any visible scratches. It come in an brownish color box not in a originally box. also it comes with charger and lightening cable but with no any headsets. I think is ok for an refurbished item.

"1318","After Hillary-ING my iPhone (destroyed) out of frustration with Draconian security and snobby support I purchased  a Galaxy and have been satisfied.  Apple can suck it
            "
"1319","Good quality phone! Apple is an amazing brand!
            "
"1320","I usually am very hesitant to buy anything refurbished because of bad luck in the past.  I decided to test my luck with one of these iPhone 6Ss and I have to say I am pretty satisfied. The phone was in perfect condition, no scratches on the case or glass.  Normally I buy a glass screen protector and it came with one already installed.  The glass underneath the protector did not look damaged or scratched so I was not worried.  The phone operates like a new phone.  No lag or slowness to it.  The battery charges well and holds a charge very well.  The phone comes with a new 3rd party lightning cable and charger.  I was hoping for an Apple original but they seem to be working fine.  If the cable goes out in the future I will probably just get another original cable and charger.  It does not come with earbuds.Overall I have to say this phone is pretty much the same as buying a new one besides the accessories.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a new phone but wants to save some extra cash on a slightly older model.  This phone, iPhone 6s has close to the same specs as the new iPhone SE but I like this 6s because it is thinning, has rounded edges.  I purchased the 64GB version which is perfect for all my storage needs and is still less than the 128GB version of the SE.

"1321","We had checked the phone for basic functionalities here after purchase, and worked ok, but we had to take it to Spain to our grandson. Our son took it to a local Movistar store for a new sim card and hook-up to their network. All worked fine. Phone was in excellent, as new, condition, everything works fine and grandson is happy.
            "
"1322","I bought this refurbished iPhone for my daughter. Before I gave it to her, I had it for a week and tested most of the functionalities and features that I could. Everything works great. (Connectivity, upload/download, hotspot, camera resolution, fingerprint, icloud features, FaceTime, restrictions, etc.)Also the iPhone is in pristine condition, no scratches or nooks visible to the naked eye. This was a great buy.
            "
"1323","Don't buy from ""ProElectronics"". The phone they gave me wasn't assembled correct and the screen is popping out of the phone.
            "
"1324","As advertised!  Great condition, works flawless
            "
"1325","My phone came in great condition, but it turns out was made in Japan. I could never turn off the shutter sound when I took a photo. Apple could not help me with this issue either since it came from a Japanese manufacturer. I put up with it for months and now I'm really annoyed with it. RETURNED!
            "
"1326","Phone is doing well with no glitches. Took it to ATT and had a diagnostic done on it and it checked out!!
            "
"1327","Phone ended up being a used device and ultimately had battery bloat. However, Apple replaced it for the price of the battery. Be aware that refurb can mean it may have been used.
            "
"1328","Bad phone received it turning on turning off did all the troubleshooting Apple helped Amazon help phone still did not work one main reason why I don't buy refurbished products
            "
"1329","Wow, what a beauty.  I think mine was a new phone, excessed from a carrier.  It came from ""Wharehouse Deals"" because the box was damaged.  It had an older operating system on it and needed to be updated first.
            "
"1330","Shipped fast install was a breeze over all very happy with 6s
            "
"1331","Don't buy used iPhones. Ever. Just stop. If you cannot afford new, go get an android. You will be happier anyway. The hassle of returning 3 just to get a half decent working one is just NOT WORTH IT.
            "
"1332","I bought this phone through Magic Mobil Partners and they were great, even emailing me to make sure everything was okay. Be aware that the casing is not original, but the screen is flush with the casing as it should be and is a high quality screen unlike in some refurbished models. I am very happy with the purchase and would buy again.
            "
"1333","Phone is defective home button does not work fingerprint scanner does not work had to take this to an Apple store to find out too late for me to return it very disappointed
            "
"1334","Phone will not hold a charge even after I purchased a new battery. I don¡¯t see how this could¡¯ve really been refurbished. Very disappointed would not recommend.
            "
"1335","The phone had minimal damage just a very tiny bit on the corner other than that the phone was in good condition. Arrived on time. It did have a few moments where it froze, if it continues I will return it.
            "
"1336","My iPhone arrived quickly, it was unlocked as promised and in great condition. It looks completely new, with no visible scratches or any sign of use. It even had the latest operating system installed. I'm very happy with this purchase.

"1339","Condition of phone was excellent! Had it a few days now and works great. Charger came with phone also.
            "
"1340","Based on other reviews, ordered from the seller ""BREED"". Phone came in good condition with no visible scratches, generic charger, no headphones (as promised) and was originally used with sprint & unlocked,Was able to use it with T-Mobile for sometime and then ported to AT&T two weeks back week without any issues.Used the phone during my vacation last week. All features worked perfectly fine and full battery lasted for more than a day with heavy Camera,GPS,LTE usage. Hope it continues to be good
            "
"1341","Pretty good. It's in near perfect condition, refurbished nicely. Definitely would recommend buying
            "
"1342","iPhone look good but have defective speaker I expend extra money for fix it. So the quality inspection is very low from this seller.
            "
"1343","its perfect...
            "
"1344","Broke/Bent Easy - Had to Buy Another. Even with An otterbox the phone bent like a banana. Great Phone, Not The Best 4K Though, Perfect to get you by with good storage and speed.
            "
"1345","The phone came well-packaged with a phone charger. I have had it for almost 2 months now and so far have had no problems. Keeping my fingers crossed that nothing goes wrong after the 90-day warranty ends.
            "
"1346","As described - looks and works like brand new
            "
"1347","At first, I was a little skeptical about getting a phone off of Amazon... but this phone is great! I got it for a good price, it was easy to set up, no difficulties with it whatsoever. It feels like I got a brand new phone!

            "
"1351","I was buying it as new but realized it used because I found an old SIM card inside.I complained but fell on deaf ears.
            "
"1352","Great alternative to paying big bucks buying through your phone company.  Mine works great as advertised and looks new. Much better battery than my previous phone. Shipped quickly.
            "
"1353","I love my phone, still using it had it for a while, but the charging port is giving me problems, but would recommend if you are trying to save product cost
            "
"1354","Worked very well, found no defects in phone. Slight (very minor) damage to exterior, but otherwise in great shape.
            "
"1355","I was super skeptical reading all the negative reviews here, however, I trusted Amazon more than any other refurbished phone seller out there including Best Buy so I thought it was worth giving a shot. I ordered an iPhone 6s 16gig rose gold from the seller Vius and I was pleasantly surprised when the phone arrived literally overnight, so 5 stars for shipping fast. The phone - well it's practically spotless. No scratches, no Dings, no Dents whatsoever. It's in pristine condition. I can tell that the screen was probably replaced but I can tell that only because I deal with a lot of mobile devices as part of my job, but the screen is brand new and works flawlessly. The battery is holding up pretty good upto about 8-10 hrs and I think that was replaced as well, which is good. The phone came in a generic box, with a generic power adapter and cable (both new, but non-apple). There was no earphones with it which was kind of expected but that wasn't a problem since I had a pair of brand new earpods with me. This phone was a gift for my mom and she loves it so far. To anyone who is looking to buy one - make sure you review the list of sellers, see the seller reviews and look at their phone reviews (since they may be selling other stuff too), make sure the seller has significant number of reviews (the more the better), and lastly make sure that it says ""FULFILLMENT BY AMAZON"".
            "
"1356","Wow!!! So glad a purchased this phone instead of buy from my carrier
            "

"1372","Hi.. Well unfortunately- due the fact I was going through some family issues, I didn¡¯t activate this phone till way after I received it. As I now seek help, I see TODAY is the last day to return the phone!!! (and it¡¯s a Sunday).  So guess I am stuck with this phone.  Yes- I realize it¡¯s a ¡°refurbished¡± phone, & I guess, you get what you pay for <U+0001F914>..There is definitely something wrong with the volume.. If it¡¯s not on speaker phone, I can hardly hear the caller, volume raised to the max.I feel the battery has issues as well.  I have no music, a few pics, no videos, and it goes from fully charged to 24% literally in the blink of an eye.Not happy.. I¡¯ll have to suck it up as a loss, probably go back to my Galaxy 8 .. and will never ever purchase ¡°Certified Refurbished¡± again.
            "

"1384","I bought an iPhone 6S 64GB Space Gray from Mango Wireless CR Division. It looked all good when it arrived and worked as expecteduntil one day when it just suddenly stopped working for no reason. It just wont turn on. I have taken super good care of it given its anexpensive phone and yet this is what happened. Now I am kinda stuck since this does not have any manufacturer warranty and the sellerwarranty is only 90 days!So think twice before you buy a certified refurbished - You neither know what they refurbish nor what they certify !

            "
"1514","The phone is in good condition albeit the sim card holder is peeled out where the hole is. Its minor, and the tray still comes out. The product was received right on time as well.HOWEVER, this iPhone does not have wifi OR bluetooth! I have done a complete iTunes reset, updated the iOS, reset the network settings multiple times, and it still does not work. The control screen has the wifi symbol crossed out and the wifi in Settings>Wifi is grayed out. In the control screen the bluetooth symbol is always blue, wont change when I press it. In Settings>Bluetooth you just see the spinning loading symbol that never changes. Not even a button is there.Wifi is absolutely imperative to the use of any smart device. You even need it for updating iOS. Bluetooth is incredibly important for file transfers, hands free calls while driving, etc etc. This phone is no good at all without those features.I will be emailing the seller right away and will be updating this.
            "
"1515","Had some itchy problems sometimes when typing sms or when chatting, but it was good overall.
            "
"1516","Mine seems to be alright so far.  It came with generic cord and plug; no ear buds. The phone looks like it is in really good shape. I was able to get it signed on to Verizon without any trouble.  I do get a few odd calls sometimes but the person never calls me back??  No big deal.  The phone came pretty fast.  Just got it a month ago and have not used it too much yet.

"1549","I love my new phone, at first I was scared because I read a few reviews of people saying they received a locked phone and that their phones stopped working eventually. The only problem I've had so far is that I received the phone with a few scratches on that back but I knew I wouldn't get a perfect phone because its refurbished. I didn't get headphones but I did get a charger. It also gets a bit hot when charging but that's only when I use it while its charging and I think that happens with every phone when you over work it. So far its good and I love the color I got.

Downloaded back up & everything is working great.  BTW there are ways to break in or rejuvenate your battery.  If that doesn't work Amazon has do it your self new battery kits with tools.  Great deal.  Yes these are used rejuvenated phones. I ordeeed 2 & both are mint.

"1580","Very nice
            "
"1581","fast and good product
            "
"1582","The phone arrived in a not so good packaging. The phone was inside a pouch inside a weak feeble blue box. The phone has around 4 scratches 3 on the corner and a very slight one on the screen. Scratches did not disappoint me as bad as the packaging. I had ordered a rose gold of the same model and same price. That phone came in an excellent packaging with not even a single scratch. A bit more disappointed comparing this one to the other phone. The phone was pretty dirty with dirt around the primary camera and in the speaker and mike holes there was a lot of dirt giving me a experience to realise that the phone is a really old one. The phone function as it should. Confirming with apple I got to know that the phone was first activated in September 2015 which makes the phone really very old.
            "
"1583","The iphone is working good, looks like new, thanks
            "
"1584","Very disappointed.  Phone still had previous owner's information.  Was unable to log in to icloud to update with my daughter's info.Also, previous owner had vulgar, inappropriate photos on phone.  My 12 year old did not need to see!  Very careless of DealFisher. Obviouslydid not check phone before selling.  Phone is being returned today.  Will not use DealFIsher again!
            "
"1585","Work perfectly with all sim-cards but with T-mobile because of some ""non due payment"". I live outside the US so I don't care about it. But while in the US i wasted 30 dollars for the sim-cards that wasn't working with the phone and that was upsetting
            "
"1586","Although I had to return the phone because my daughter didn't need it any longer, it was just as described and the seller was very responsive.
            "
"1587","I had a problem with the first phone I got from them: a nonfunctioning charger, and two scratches (I would've been fine with one of those problems, but not both. They quickly accept my return and refunded the money.Because they really good reviews I decided to try again, since their prices are great, and this time they sent me a flawless product that looks, works, and feels like new.
            "
"1588","Looks new the iPhone, even is a Refurbished phone but looks as new one. Only missing are the ear pods which didn't include these (as advertised) but rest is Fine!... it's a gift for my daughter!Shipped and Receipt on Time, good service and product.

"1591","Good phone works great!!!!
            "
"1592","Phone is locked. I had to pay shipping when I returned item. Not worth it. I bought two phones, I couldn¡¯t leave a review to the one that I returned; looks like they clinch the system. It explains all the good reviews. This one I couldn¡¯t returned since I sent it overseas. Both phones were locked.
            "
"1593","I bought this iPhone for my daughter and I have read some reviews about phones being locked. The phone looked brand new, and worked at once with our telephone supplier. Recommended!!

            "
"1599","The phone was in a really good shape. It didn't come with headphones and the charger was not from Apple but I don't think that deserves a star out as they advised for that possibility. It was the first time I bought a refurbished item and based on this experience is a very good value for money option, I recommend.
            "
"1600","Charger is different from the original iPhone/Apple products. No box, no headset. I didn't put simcard yet but when i do i will update my review. Very disappointing!

            "
"1608","UPDATED: I don't know what the issue is. But after a week of having it, it's starting to have memory issues. Saying it's running out of space. It makes it almost useless for anything besides call and text. And I need a phone for business. I don't know what I'm going to do. But I wish I got a phone that didn't have this issue!!'I was worried about buying a phone on Amazon. I hunting for many hours and decided on this one sold by EMB-Phones. After reading some reviews, I saw the only huge issue people had with this was they couldn't take it outside the US. No issue for me. But it does need a SIM card to use. I using it with AT&T and it works great. The phone is in PERFECT condition. So brand new I couldn't tell it was refurbished. It runs smoothly as well. No issues so far with it, but it's only been a week in. If issues arise, I will update. The finger print works and is really cool! I suggest saving money and buying refurbished but I'd also suggest doing some real research into who you're buying from before you make a purchase.

It took me 2 weeks to decide if I should buy this Refurbished iPhone or buy a new one, and after 2 weeks me and my girlfriend we decided to buy it.

Please make sure that prior to purchasing these phone you do know that you can NOT purchase apple care.  I was told my apple that I could get apple care to find out that I am not able to get the apple care.  If I would have know I could not get the apple care I would not have purchase this phone.  Apple care to me is important.  This is just my little rant about it.  Phone works just fine as it should.

"1634","The iPhone 6S is an excellent product. Millions of people around the world love this phone. Most would agree that it's one of the most popular, well-made, beautiful, high-performing cell phones on the market.Most of the reviews on this page are for SELLERS, not the iPhone. These refurbished phones are sold by lots of different sellers through Amazon. If they're selling lemons and advertising them as ""refurbished,"" that's a problem and AMAZON SHOULD FIX IT. If you receive a product that is not in the advertised condition, RETURN IT, complain to the seller, and report it to Amazon. But don't give the iPhone a bad review unless you actually have a problem with the iPhone 6S itself.  It's not Apple's fault that someone sold you a scratched phone, or one that's been used so much that the battery won't charge. Right?

"1635","Can¡¯t turn it into a car HUD which is why I bought it. Have to delete entire words to correct 1 letter. Can¡¯t go to first character. Autocorrect is crazy especially if you speak different languages. Voice recognition seems worse than Anderoid. No good 2-way dash cam app to use with GPS. No zoom? Can¡¯t play MP3s? Can¡¯t always take screenshots? Security super tight. Takes me days to find my passwords. Bought it brand new now I miss my Android phones. I had such expectations from Apple. Good luck next time.AZ, philosophy BA

"1647","- Item is amazing, as described and of perfect quality. Highly recommended.  Hope this review was helpful and if so please click yes. Thank you!
            "
"1648","You're probably reading comments all paranoid like I did. Lol. This is a positive review. I LOVE IT. Looks brand new. Works fast and great. If you have any questions about my experience you can contact me at my Instagram @abenaasf
            "
"1649","Poor quality control. It was wiped, but was still registered to the prior owner. I contacted the seller (Breed), and they would not replace for another unit. I would not trust this seller.
            "
"1650","So I purchased two phones from these guys, noting mostly positive reviews from their previous customers.  Both arrived in really good shape and appeared to work properly.  However, while one of them has had no issues, the other one has had intermittent reception issues and now will not hold a charge.  Clearly the device has some problems and now needs a new battery.  I purchased these less than 6 months ago and got Square Trade warranties, which unfortunately do not cover battery replacement. The seller only offers a very conditional 90 day warranty.  The moral of this story?  Sometimes you get a good phone and sometimes you get a piece of junk.  Buyers beware!
            "
"1651","So I thought I¡¯d wait a bit after my purchase to make a review about this product because I know some things can happen later on and I didn¡¯t want to regret rating incorrectly.For starters, the product came exactly when it was supposed to. A+ for fast shipping. I was excited to receive my package but a little disappointed that they¡¯d just left it in front of my door. It¡¯s a good thing I was able to be home at the time and expecting it. I thought since it¡¯s a phone, they¡¯d want a sign off.Anywho, after opening I started to inspect the phone. The screen and back appeared to have some white smudge marks on them (I still have no idea what they were) but I was able to clean it with an alcohol wipe. There also appeared to be something white completely covering the speakers and inside the charge port which put me off a bit. I became worried.Since I¡¯ve received the phone, the performance has been normal. No shutting off randomly, no bugging, nothing a phone shouldn¡¯t be doing. It¡¯s been performing completely normal as it should be and charging at a pretty good speed, especially since I use my phone for work and play. The only complaint I have there is the speakers, which don¡¯t appear to sound very loud. Speaker phone doesn¡¯t really help with that either. The camera works well and so does the flash. No worries there. The phone was unlocked as stated and I was able to immediately connect my phone service with it.I haven¡¯t dropped it yet (knocks on wood) & hopefully I won¡¯t ever. The 6s has been my favorite version since it came out.For the price of the phone, the overall of it is great. I would definitely recommend it to others and hopefully you¡¯ll all get the most out of it. As for any iPhone, I also recommend purchasing a shockproof case at the same time of your phone purchase.I hope my honest review helps any others looking to buy their phones online.

"1652","It was good and perfect for a week, and the battery died and it never turned back on, i am very disappointed i want a refund
            "
"1653","The device is not unlocked for international use, it is unlocked for only US network carriers, i had to pay $70 to get it working in My home country. overall the phone is awesome, its new and does not have any wear or scratches on it
            "
"1654","Phone is in perfect cosmetic condition. No knicks, dings, or scratches. Screen is also perfect (no scratches, dead pixels, etc). Phone performs perfectly as well. Buying refurbished can be nerve wracking but this seller did not disappoint. Thank you!
            "
"1655","I brought my iPhone 6s from seller Chubbiestech. The only negative thing I would say was I ordered this phone with express 2 day shipping but I didn¡¯t get in until my third day. I ordered the phone Wednesday expecting it to come Friday but it arrived Monday.None the less, this phone is awesome. Just because I received this phone after 2 days late, the phone itself outweighs my only con. This phone was totally unlocked. The description says only GSM unlocked (AT&T and T-Mobile) but my Verizon prepaid service (CDMA) works perfectly fine with this phone. I thought I would have to switch my service but I¡¯m glad I didn¡¯t have to. It was very easy to set up and this phone damn near is brand new. There¡¯s is only one little nic on the top gold part but when you put an case on it, it will hide it all.This phone came with a generic usb charger, car charger price, phone case, sim opener, and my phone came with a screen protector already on.I highly recommend buying from Chubbiestech.
            "
"1656","It was locked and under some one's contract with an unpaid bill.I didn't like it - complete waste of time
            "
"1657","The phone lasts less than 12 hours after 20 minutes of talk, a handful of texts, and a small bit of web browsing. wifi and bluetooth are on. For comparison, with my old iphone 6, that's at least a year older than what this outfit sold me, in the same environment and settings, I get close to 24 hours.  I contacted customer support and they said that's not a problem for them, they test only for it to last 10 hours. They offered return and refund, but this is wasting my time. I offered for them to instead pay for the $29 Apple battery replacement offer, but they declined. Considering that I'll replace the battery anyway if I get a different refurb'ed phone, I'll keep this one and get the battery replaced in a few weeks once I know the unit is otherwise working well, since MyWit support said if I have Apple replace the battery it'll void their warranty.
            "
"1658","The phone is really great! I was worrying that the phone will have scratches or will be locked, BUT IT IS PERFECT! Perfect condition!
            "
"1659","My wife has been on a REALLY old phone (iPhone 4S!!!), so as an early Valentine's Day gift for her, I decided to get her this rose gold iPhone 6S-- she was really blown away by it!!! I bought the phone from Chubbiestech, they shipped it really fast! The phone is Certified Refurbished, but it basically looks and works as if it were a brand new phone!
            "
"1660","I have been a customer of Amazon's for 10 years. I'm pleased to say I have never had a poor experience from anything I've purchased. The exception to that being this refurbished cellphone. The phone I bought was actually quite nice, looked practically brand new. Issue was the battery barely lasted a day. But the REAL issue was the fact that even though it was unlocked and I had a SIM card I knew worked (because I took it out of my working Iphone 6) the phone would intermittently (at best) work with T-Mobile. It was show full service and LTE and then just no data or cell service. It would then go to 4G or 3G and then to no service. If I put it in airplane mode and then back out of airplane mode it would maybe start working.THAT SAID, I figure, hey the package says to just call the third party that actually sold the phone for support. I did that 3 times and I also emailed them. Contrary to their claim DealFisher didn't care about my business or more importantly my satisfaction seeing I never got a call or email from them. I called T-Mobile and Amazon, both of which worked with me for about 30 minutes each trying to get the phone to work to no avail. I ended up packing up the phone and returning it and just bought a new phone from a friend. Long story short is I will NEVER trust a refurbished device again thanks to this experience and I will be very hesitant to use a third party seller on amazon again.My recommendation to you is: amazon does have a great 90 day return policy so if you're trying to scrape by and get a pretty decent and new-like phone give it a shot, you might get lucky. I'd say have a CLOSE look at the seller's reviews and see if they seem to sell junk phones to lots of people. And my best advice, never purchase from DealFisher!
            "
"1661","I¡¯m not going to lie, I was terrified of ordering a refurbished phone from amazon especially with all the mixed reviews. However after reading through the reviews from one specific seller (BuySpry) I felt a little more confident! My phone came on time, with a little difficulty though, but that has more to do with FedEx than it has to do with the seller.... Anyways my phone looks as good as new, the quality is great and I was able to insert my sim with ease and no problems so I¡¯m very happy! I would recommend ordering from BuySpry if possible... they have some of the best reviews I¡¯ve seen as far as sellers go.... also be mindful when changing GB and color because the sellers change as well. Anyways I¡¯m very pleased and happy I ordered!.....Okay, I¡¯ve had this phone for little over a month now and I¡¯ve realized that when I take photos, it always makes the shutter noise (even in silent mode). I¡¯ve done some research and found out that this is because iPhones intended to be sold in certain countries dont allow you to turn off the noise, for privacy reasons. Tbh this is really annoying to me and bothersome, I have anxiety so to take pictures in silent places and have your camera shutter is like the worse for me. This isn¡¯t to deter people from buying this phone but just be mindful that this might be a problem for you as well. However I still love my phone quite a lot and would still recommend!

"1662","Bought a new phone for my dad for fathers day! Even though it was pink only this seller had positive reviews and I didnt want to end up with a dud. Came right on time had to sign for it and in an iphone-esque box. All good i put it in a nice case and my dad was good to go! Works great no issues at all. Could see some wear and tear around the part where you charge and head phone insert but overall great job on the refurb!! Idk about other sellers but Chubbie is the truth. Ps i was not paid for this i shelled out over $200 of my own money.
            "
"1663","This cellphone has a hardware problem. I reset it but still the same problem. The apps doesnt work, it shut downs spontaneously and sometimes it freezes and i have to reset the phone to make it work again. Doesn't work please I need you to contact me in order to solve this problem
            "
"1664","I received this phone to find the outer shell and screen in good condition. However, after I ran diagnostics on the battery, I was disappointed to find that it was not in healthy condition. The ""design capacity"" of the battery was at ~75% and had been cycled through over 400 complete charge cycles. All this to say, the battery was in a significantly used and degraded condition. If you order an Amazon Certified Refurbished phone, just keep in mind that it you may receive a phone/battery in similar condition.
            "
"1665","First off all before I get to the phone the charger wasn't working, it was a third party charger that wasn't supported. And now  the phone had scratches! (that I didn't mind) but when I I stared using it I realized that sensor isn't working! So the  certified refurbished is just a lie it's a used broken item that someone sent back!
            "
"1666","I complained about the battery (Because i have to charge it everyday at least 2 or 3 times) and the seller has done nothing about it.
            "
"1667","I was so nervous about ordering a refurbished phone, but needed to replace my iPhone 6s and needed an affordable option. So glad I took the chance, as so far has worked out great! Phone came packaged nicely in box (not original iPhone box) and included charger. Note that it did not include the headphones which was not an issue for me, not sure I would want refurbished headphones anyways. Phone was very clean and looked brand new. Set up was super easy as expected (no manual, but again not needed) and has been working perfectly. I am so thankful there is a trustworthy company offering an affordable option for this phone, and would buy from them again.
            "
"1668","Previously I gave a two on this product.  However, I believe it was most likely my mistake of not knowing what I was doing.  I complained that the battery did not stay charged.  The first night it did not, but after speaking with my sister I realized that it may have been updating the first night and that is what ran the battery down so quickly.  I was very busy and decided to try to deal with it a few more days.  As it turns out it seems to be working great.  There is one small problem, it doesn't tell me what percentage of power is left.  It shows the icon that show approximately how much battery life it has, but it doesn't name the percentage and I don't really like that.  However, it's not something I can't live with and will be keeping this phone unless there turns out to be new issues.
            "
"1669","Sold By Platinum DealsShipped By AmazonHad less than 24 hours before initiating return!!!Pros: Great physical condition, screen in perfect condition, boxed pretty good. charger seemed to charge fast.Cons: Battery was at less than 50% of its life according to the technician at the Apple Store they said it needed replaced immediately(was supposed to have at least 80% of its battery life left), two small scratches on the back of the phone, came in plain white box, off-brand charger, no headphones.If the battery would have been at 80% or better than I would have definitely recommend this phone and company but because of the battery needing replaced immediately after receiving the phone I sadly would not recommend this company! I am returning and trying one from VIP Outlet so I will update this when I see what the Apple Store says about the new one.
            "
"1670","The refurb on this phone was AWFUL! First -  The phone came in and within 20 minutes the screen was glitching.  It kept detecting that 1 spot on the screen kept being touched repeatedly.  First I thought it was the screen protector, so I took it off.  That didn't fix it.  So I did a factory reset and that fixed it for like 3 days, then it started happening again daily and wouldn't stop until I restarted the phone.  Another thing that happens is that at least once I day I have to reset to get the touch screen to detect touch properly... It'll detect the touch about 1/8 inch from where I actually touch the screen.  Next the battery it came with is crap.. it's already degraded down to 73%.  I have to pay to get another battery.  And finally - the screen autodims out of nowhere, setting show it's as bright as it goes, but in bright sunlight I can't see crap because it has decided to dim itself out.  I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A REFURB FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!  BUYER BEWARE!**edit... Took my phone in to replace the battery and was told all my problems from day one were because of water damage.  They sold me an extremely water damaged phone.  All I could do was replace it.

"1671","My Phone Came In Great Condition From ¡°Chubbiestech¡± even though it Said refurbished the phone looked perfectly new I was expecting a small scratch or dent but there was nothing. I got the phone in the end of February and it still works great and in good condition it also came with a charger, screen protector, and sim card tool but no headphones.I hoped this helped some of you all with your choice.

"1672","The iPhone died after the 90 day window and the only response was 'too bad'.  If you can't certify that the product will function you shouldn't sell it as certified refurbished.

"1673","Bought this phone for my son who is 11 and thought it will be a good option to get refurbished rather than a new one , given his age . However, this phone¡¯s battery is completely useless ! Noticed battery percentage was going down really fast , then decide it to charge it to 100% and even set it to power  saving mode . After a few hours , it went down to 30% without even using  it <U+0001F621>So disappointed with this purchase !! Will never buy from this seller again , would rather stick to Groupon since I bought 2 phones from them and never had any issues like this or any at all !

"1674","I was pleasantly surprised when the 6S iphone arrived earlier than expected.  It came in a new box similar to that of a new phone.  I was impressed with a brand new charger adapter and cord neatly wrapped in the box.  The rose colored phone looked virtually new with a protective film of both sides of the phone.  As ordered, the phone was a an unlocked GSM that fired right up after inserting my old TMobile sim card (the old phone went for a dip in our pool.)  All of the old data, contacts, e-mails magically downloaded from the I-Cloud.  I have only had the phone for three days so I cannot comment on its long term reliability but I have no reason to question it.  I selected Amazon Dealfisher because it was sponsored by Amazon and had very high long term ratings.
            "
"1675","My was from ¡°myWit¡±, come in perfect condition, no any scratch or other stuff, looks like brandnew.
            "
"1676","Basically, I receive it, charge it and start using it.After I have done the setup, I started noticing the touchscreen doesn't work.When typing, it doesn't take what I type in or response multiple times. For example, I tried to type ""run"". Sometimes, it only shows ""un"" or ""rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrun"". After contacting tech support, wipe out the phone and do everything again. After done setting, I don't even have any way to log in because one of my pin numbers has the problem.  Tried to type ""0"", but the same situation happened. So, I decided to return it. When trying to wipe out the phone again, the same thing happened to final confirm wipe out area. Receiving this phone is really frustrating, the seller should check phone thoughtfully before sent out. If they don't, this is just wasting both sides' time and time is money.  Giving one star because sending me something that doesn't work.
            "
"1677","Phone meets if not exceeds my expectations of quality for a refurb phone. I had no trouble setting up after popping in my sim card. The battery seems okay. The only damage I noticed was very moderate and shallow scratching on the screen. I didn't even see it until the phone was powered off; it has no effect on the quality of the user experience whatsoever. Charger that came with it was aftermarket and there were no headphones - just as advertised and expected. Charger works just fine. I will be sure to update if I encounter any issues regarding the function. Thanks for the fast shipping! My phone came from Tech Venture, for reference.
            "
"1678","Bought this for my daughter and we are very happy with the purchase! Cosmetically, the phone is in brand new, 10/10 condition! Works just like a brand new phone. Cord & block are aftermarket & work great, but we already had Apple branded cord and block so she is using those. Set up was simple. For Straight Talk I just switched the sim from her 5s to the 6s. Will update on battery life after some use, but so far it is working perfectly and my daughter couldn't be happier! (My pictures aren't the best quality, so anything that may look imperfect is definitely from my camera and not on the phone itself!)ETA: We're a couple months in & this phone has held up famously. Battery life is perfect, no quirks, no glitches, no loosey goosey ports, nothing wrong at all. Still an A+++

"1679","My son dropped his old iPhone in a puddle and parts of the touch screen and display were unusable.  I saw this iPhone at a great price, read the great reviews and figured I would give it a try.  I was easily able to remove the sim card from the old phone and put it in the new phone.  Both were Iphones  6S and everything went fine.  I was unable to find any marks or flaws on the phone, it looked and acted like a brand new phone.  My son has had it for over a month now and reports that its great.

"1680","Love the iPhone products but was hoping to save some money on my daughter's phone.  Within 90 days the microphone stopped working.  Well it still worked, it was just impossible to have conversation on the iPhone.  I contacted the seller who could not locate my customer record.  I then contacted amazon for help and they graciously offered to waive the 30 day return window and let me return the phone.  This seemed like a reasonable solution, until I discovered the 20% restocking fee!!  Almost $70 hit on a 2 month old ""refurbished warranty"".  If I would have known I was going to be charged that much, I would have sent it in for repairs as per their product warranty.  I guess I will be buying my phones new from now on.

"1681","This iPhone 6s is a good size, nice looking, is a reliable alarm clock, texting is easy, however, I cannot make or receive a phone call.  I always get ""I cannot hear you, you are fading in and out"".....  It has been this way since I got the phone.  Would not buy a certified refurbished phone again.
            "
"1682","This 6S arrived in two days as advertised.  It was in new condition with the exception of two tiny marks on the back and a very small scuff on one corner. The glass was perfect. This phone is a replacement for my 5S, which I had backed up on my Macbook. The Macbook and 6S refused to talk to one another and I finally had to call T-Mobil. Working with their tech, I finally was able to convince the computer and phone to communicate. It turns out the phone was woefully behind in software updates. It must have been sitting on a shelf for an extended period. Once we got the downloads going it took over 20 minutes to complete.  Ultimately, I spend almost an hour working with T-Mobil, but the tech was great.IMPORTANT: I was careful to buy the phone from DealFisher, which is the highest rated vendor I could identify.

"1683","I purchased this product for my daughter and just after the 60 day warranty the phone stopped working.  Prior to that the battery would not hold...we figured we would need to replace the battery since Apple sent out the notification; however, when we went to replace it, the repair man said the phone was broken and wasn't worth fixing....Money wasted and this seller is selling JUNK!

"1684","I purchased this iPhone 2 months ago on 10/04/18. The phone worked fine at the beginning but 3 days later the battery started messing up that i had to take it to get the battery replaced. Now 2 months later my iPhone died completely. I placed my phone on the counter the night before. The next day when i wanted to use it the phone was completely dead. I thought the battery had died so i charged it during the day for hours waiting for it to turn on. It never did so i took it to get it fixed once again. At the place they told me it was the RAM of the phone that didn't work at all. I don't know how this happened because i took good care of the phone. That is why i give it a 2 over all rating.

"1685","I purchased this phone for my sister to replace a lost one.  She absolutely loves it!  So far I haven't heard any complaints from her.  The company who sold the phone sent it promptly, with a letter assuring that if I needed anything to contact them.  It's only been a few days, but so far so good.  Also the phone was in excellent condition and she no problem having her carrier- At&T activate the phone.  I keep you posted if anything goes wrong.

"1687","One negative was that the battery condition was 85% of a new battery.  A poor battery (replacement) was the reason that my original unit was being replaced and I anticipated a new condition battery.  It was otherwise in essentially new, condition.  I would consider refurbishing including a new battery if, on checking, the original battery was only 85% of new.  The unit works well and this is not grounds to return it.  It just means some minor decrease in battery life.  Since I routinely recharge overnight, it is, for me at least, a minor problem.
            "
"1688","Didn't meet delivery deadline and t phone stop working 1 week afterwards.
            "
"1689","Ordered the phone and it arrived on time and packaged nicely.  No real signs of wear, and phone booted fine.  The problem ensued about two days after getting the phone.  It would no longer hold a full charge and began shutting off at around 18% to 24%, depending on if it was in power saver or not, a clear sign that the battery was defective.  For a refurbished phone that is supposed to ""work like new,"" that is unacceptable.  My son has an iPhone SE that he has had for a year and a half that has better battery life and battery wear than this phone.  Thankfully, we were able to get a refund, but I would not buy from this seller again.  Now I am down a phone and not sure if I am willing to trust any ""certified refurbished"" phone again.
            "
"1690","Product description reads ""certified to work and look like new"". They are no where near like new. Mine came with a broken camera and the phone looks like it's 50 years old. The quality on Amazon is getting worse by the day. Instead of wasting his time with his blog WaPo, Jeff Bezos should focus more on his business and make sure Amazon stops degrading so rapidly.

"1693","The phone was great for the first couple of weeks, but then started acting up. The camera first started to lock up then the phone itself started to get hot.

Apple Service Center in India has checked the history of this purchased IPhone through its IMEI Number and says that this phone has earlier also faced the same problem and now again the phone is dead. I have no idea what to do. I do not recommend anyone to buy Certified Refurbished IPhones.

"1699","I have had this phone for about a month and it has been working great. It looks brand new. No scratches or cracks. Battery doesn't last as long as it would if it were brand new but still lasts pretty long. Usually charge it once a day or twice if I'm constantly on it. The price is great and more affordable than buying it brand new. It worked fine with my T-Mobile service.

"1700","This is a great phone and it worked right out of the box, mostly.  I plugged in my T-Mobile sim card and the phone worked immediately.The only reason this product isn't getting 5 stars is that it shipped with the ear speaker clogged with gunk to the point that no sound came through until I cleaned it out myself.  Also, the cable that it came with didn't work (which I didn't realize until I was camping in the middle of nowhere with a dead phone).
            "
"1701","My phone came 4 days early which is great. This is an honest review guys so I am going to be very honest. I ordered from the seller OlympicWireless and also fulfilled by amazon. When I opened the box the phone looked amazing. The only thing was the home button wouldn¡¯t press down. It still worked so that was no big deal. The battery health was at 86% which is not bad at all. Camera looks great and all the buttons work. I have not yet activated it because it is a gift for my sister as she is going from an android to an iPhone. As far as mechanics, it works great. I will be giving feedback as she uses the phone for a longer period of time

"1702","First off: I¡¯m the one that reads all the reviews, but have literally NEVER posted a review. This warranted one. The seller was Buyspry. The phone was absolutely FLAWLESS!

I¡¯m on day two of using the phone, everything works great and the battery life is what I typically had by the end of the day with my old iPhone. Hope this review helps anyone else who is like me in regards to reading all reviews prior to purchasing.
            "
"1703","Very pleased. Searched quite a while and this was a great value.
            "
"1704","Some of the reviews were scary so I purchased this with some trepidation. Unwarranted. My purchase arrived on time, looks new, was unlocked, no glitches and the battery life is great. Just wished it came with a $50 iTunes phone card. In other words, I have no sensible complaints.
            "
"1705","Phone as described. Arrived 3 days earlier than expected. In excellent cosmetic condition. Battery life isn¡¯t all that great for extreme use and provided charger doesn¡¯t work but overall its a great buy.
            "
"1706","Phone was in perfect working order.  It was unlocked as stated and there were no flaws in anything.  The phone even had the new plastic film to protect the screen and the back from scratches.  Have been using the phone for several months now with no issues.  Love it and would do business with these people again!
            "
"1707","After four months of owning the phone, it shut off and would only enter recovery mode. I brought the phone to the Apple store. They told me that the whoever owned the phone prior tampered with it. Additionally, they mentioned that there was a hole in the phone where on a normal 6s there is no hole. Highly disappointed in the lack of quality and inspection in the refurbishment and will never waste my money again with this seller.
            "
"1708","I was worried looking at a lot of the bad reviews to see if my phone would come out bad. So I took my chances and bought from the seller Chubbistech and I was very impressed by what had come, the quality of the phone was perfect with no scratches on the screen or anything. The phone was unlocked and worked with my sim. Over all a great phone.I want specifically mention the seller Chubbiestech from whom I ordered the phone. A very ethical and professional company with great customer care service. The person from their company Karen was very prompt in replying to my queries and was very helpful. O would definitely recommend to buy from this seller. A+
            "
"1709","excellent product, without a minimum of detail, like new, without the most minimal cosmetic detail, excellent conditions, apart from what interested me that should be UNLOCKED for all operators, indeed it is and I can use it in Venezuela, I recommend this seller MyWit for future purchases, products of very high quality and cute packaging plus OEM accessories, thank you.
            "
"1710","I bought 2iphones with 64 GB. I got one with so many scratches on the screen surface and I returned it. I thought 2nd one is fine. After I used the other one for 20 days I realized it's actually 16 GB. Few days ago i travelleld to India and I can't return it now.I got cheated overall.vwry bad expy
            "
"1711","The phone arrived in an attractive MyWit box with warranty card. Condition of device was very good - screen is mint without scratches, battery is at 96% capacity, and back has one scratch and minor scratching around charging port. All in all a great deal and I would buy a refurbished iPhone from MyWit again any day. Be careful which seller you choose!
            "
"1712","Now I¡¯m forced to change my feedback as this mobile is not working. This worked for 45 days and now it has 2 issues:1. Charging goes down from 80-90% to 10% or 0% sometimes.2. I¡¯m using same network in my both mobiles but this mobile appears as ¡®no service¡¯. To get the network, either restart or wait for it to appear.Now I¡¯ve to bare restocking fee and return shipping charges as return window period is over. Will not buy anymore used products.
            "
"1713","I have waited 4 months so I could give a quality interview on this. Refurbished means that this phone once upon a time was used, so something was bound to be wrong. This phone overall performs really well and was a lot faster than my phone before this. The camera on this is quite astounding for how old it is compared to the newer phones. The only problem with this phone is the ringer button by the sound buttons. I have to fidget with it to keep it so the phone will stay silent and not turn off. Sometimes it can be a pain, but the phone in of itself is great and I would totally recommend from these guys. It came in a day early and was easy to setup.
            "
"1714","phone was great. as advertised, but only lasted less than 4 months. had a 90 day warranty, which I get. asked supplier if they would do a discount to buy another under the circumstances and they said NO.
            "
"1715","I got this phone from TechVenture. I ordered this phone on a Wednesday and the estimated shipping was from Next Tuesday to Next Thursday. However I got the product Monday, a day earlier. The products looks and works like brand new. No sign of use. I was able to add service to the phone with no problems. I love my new phone.
            "
"1716","My iPhone was good for the first two months. After that it kept glitching a few times a day for no reason. It's still usable because it freezes for like fifteen second everytime. But these fifteen seconds could be frustrating if you were in hurry and it kept happening to you a lot.I don't recommend this product.
            "
"1717","It was completely as advertised. No scratches or signs of wear. It works great and still $100+ below buying a new phone of the same age. I rated the battery life low just because it came at 85%. which is above  the guaranteed minimum. It would be perfect if the batteries were replaced.
            "
"1718","What can I say about an iPhone other than it works.The phone was refurbished properly and I couldn't find any scratches or blemishes.  The battery is decent and it looked new.
            "
"1719","LOVE this phone. I was originally very very weary and hesitant to buy from a third party especially after reading some horrible reviews. But this phone has been an absolute gem for me. I have had no problems yet. (knock on wood). It arrived in great condition as described. I am overall very pleased with this
            "
"1720","Working great. I got the H2O wireless sim card and installed it in the phone. Called customer service and gave them the code for it. They updated my account with the new sim card and everything was transmitted to my phone with out any glitches. I did not have the pics but I had them saved on my PC and plugged in the phone to get them.
            "
"1721","The product was good but its battery life is horrible. I mean you can see it drain in front of you within minutes. To add to to this, in cold temperatures you will see it go from 100% to 0% in like 2-3 minutes. This is the biggest flaw in this phone. I do not recommend people to buy this.
            "
"1722","I had a 6S for a few years. We purchased this refurbished for my husband who didn¡¯t want to spend a lot on a newer phone. Battery capacity is only 84%. I assumed with a refurbished product it would have a new battery.
            "
"1723","Works great and looks new.
            "
"1724","i got mine from refurb outlet, at first i was very skeptical by looking at the reviews, but then my phone came and worked absolutely awesome no problems with it,came 2days early,and i recommend buying from refurb outlet everything is good about the phone, have no complaints
            "
"1725","This refurbished phone was a dud. Its buttons were stiff on the sides. Somethng inside was loose and would rattle around like a screw.  After all of this it never powered again after the initial set up.  Dont buy refurbished unlss from Apple.
            "
"1726","Had trouble with this unit.  When I would go to recent calls the screen would turn milky and I could not read the call.  Too clear this I would have to go back to the home page and reboot the unit.  After dealing with this issue so long I sent it back.
            "
"1727","I bought this phone in June 2017Stop working after being reset by itself on August 2018Still brand new, turn on and charging correctly, Sim card show up normallyThe only issue, it doesn't give any access to any source of network (Wifi and Data) and it doesn't work via ITunes for the reactivationGo everywhere with it, they say it might be a server problem. Only Apple can check it.I don't have Apple store near meSo sad
            "
"1728","Arrived in good shape with a few tiny imperfections.  Excellent value
            "
"1729","Got the phone was unlocked and at first thought the volume was not working turns out the volume button was off love it now, doesn't hold a lot of charge for long but overall not bad definitely on board for the apple family.
            "
"1730","Got this phone for my little sister (17yrs) and she love it. She said it works just fine. There were no scratches or anything. Although the battery life ain't so great but it an't bad either
            "
"1731","My screen began malfunctioning a couple months in - it did it intermittently so I thought perhaps it was my screen cover and didn't contact the seller. It turns out, it was not my screen cover, it's the phone. It's barely functional. To make matters worse, the ringer doesn't work. I wish I'd spent my money elsewhere. I have bought refurbished products from other sellers previously with no issues.
            "
"1732","Literally was skeptical because I researched and found negative reviews about refurbished phones, but this phone came and not a scratch or dent was on it! Looked new felt new and the battery life is great!
            "
"1733","Didn't have a problem activating, MEID was clean. Just had to get new SIM card from my carrier. Will update review if anything changes, so far so good!
            "
"1734","It started out where it would say no service in areas that i had service previously and I am disappointed in that. Now almost 9 months later, and the phone will die so quickly. The  battery barely lasts. I am pretty upset. Sometimes it will die at 6% or so. Overall I am not impressed and would not recommend as a solid day-to-day phone. I wish the battery was not so bad.
            "
"1735","I was a little skeptical after I saw all these reviews from, so many different sellers. But when I got a gold 64gb iPhone 6s from the seller MyWit, I actually was surprised to see it in a professional looking box, in perfect looking condition. There wasn¡¯t even so much as a scratch or dent on the phone! I¡¯ve had it for around 2-3 days now and see no problems at all so far. Would definitely recommend from this seller
            "
"1736","I have long thought whether to buy here iphone 6s, because of the large number of negative reviews. Still decided to buy and did not regret it! Case and screen in perfect condition - no scratches! For this price-it's the perfect device.
            "
"1737","For one, this phone is not virgin mobile compatible even though it pops up when you type in virgin mobile phones.Secondly, the phone was dirty. Something sticky like a booger on the power button and the screen was all smudgy. I know it's refurbished, but it feels like a 12 year old refurbished it. Will be returning it, lesson learned.
            "
"1738","I bought two of these phones. One came as good as new, the other one not quite. The main microphone does not work during calls but It does for taking voice notes. Also there is no way to silence camera shutter sound due to the fact that the phone came with an asian software version. It also came with lots of dirt inside both the power and the headphone connectors. Unfortunately I was able to try phone calls when I got back to my country and now I dont have the chance to take it back and ask for a refund. I regret not having bought the Galaxy S7 in B&H. One extra star because the rest works just fine.
            "
"1739","I really needed to upgrade my phone but since I don't have a contract, it seemed financially out of reach until I found this phone on Amazon. I love my new phone from how it looks to how it performs. I only have to charge my phone once a day now when on my old phone was constantly plugged in.
            "
"1740","iPhone 6s came in a good condition. The box it came seemed to be used a lot. Looked like a box to send iPhones for repair. The phone itself came in an almost perfect condition. The preowner was probably using a protection screen. The screen came without scratches in that area where the protection screen was placed. Right next to it little scratches on the glass, but totally acceptable. USB cord and plug came brand new. No ear plugs. Housing was also without scratches. At the end ""all good"" !
            "
"1741","They phone is in great shape. But the ba3 life is bad, Dies after 4 hours. I noticed it couldn¡¯t do screenshots n send directly to other applications like Wat¡¯sapp. But if u can take a screenshot (screenmunch) then move to Wat¡¯sapp n look for the pic u just munched, Then u will be fine. Don¡¯t take the delivery timing serz. Always check coz I got charged ( it read deliver by Monday, then it came on Saturday ) other than that. Ur good. The phone is great <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB>
            "
"1742","The phone is great, hands down, but there was an issue. Originally, the phone came with a slight problem with the touch screen. It seemed a bit delayed and slow, and at times wouldn¡¯t respond. All I had to do was take the screen off, disconnect it and reconnected. Since it is refurbished, I¡¯m assuming that the screen was replaced and wasn¡¯t connected properly. But the fix only took like 5 minutes, so it¡¯s all good.
            "
"1743","Battery on this iPhone had to be replaced with less than 10 months of use..  I'd suggest checking the battery life indicator upon receiving the shipping and return it if it less than 99%...Otherwise the phone works as intended, device came with no scratches and no dents.
            "
"1744","Phone died 2 months later, even repurchased another one and it is scratched and looks horrible!
            "
"1745","I received my iPhone 6s from DealFisher a little over a week ago, and honestly I couldn¡¯t find any signs that it was refurbished. I can¡¯t find one thing that would differentiate my refurbished iPhone 6s from a new one. The battery life and overall speed of the phone (internet connection, switching apps, etc.) are like new as well. I did notice the speaker has a slight ¡°crackle¡± when the volume is all the way up, but only on loud music or videos. The iPhone I received was in a generic box, it came with an aftermarket lightning cable and power adapter, which does the job. So far, I couldn¡¯t be happier with my purchase.
            "
"1746","I got this phone as a replacement to my water damaged iPhone 6, and it arrived in nice packaging with charger included and looks new.  Been using if for a couple days now, and it works great.  It's actually a nice speed upgrade over the iPhone 6 too.  Takes the sting out of dunking my last phone in the river.
            "
"1747","El producto esta bloqueado por la cuenta de ICloud, necesito me faciliten la cuenta.
            "
"1748","Well it's been a solid few months since my purchase and I've got to say I'm completely satisfied. Works perfectly. Really nice, sleek and feels new. I immediately bought a case and screen protectors so I've had zero problems so far.
            "
"1749","I've bought this item to gift one of my very close person. After opening,it was found the Sound is not working, not able to hear any sounds. No Music, Phone rings or any sounds !! Absolutely dissatisfied with this. Need to take this to the Apple store and spend $125 to fix the problem .It created a lot of shame for me for giving such a painful gift to someone. Never buy it from this seller, total waste of money.
            "
"1750","Sooo I¡¯m currently writing this from my new iPhone 6s. Before anything I say, it¡¯s important to note that I purchased from Dealfisher. The iPhone came with some minor scratches on the edges, which were covered by a case just fine. The screen is great, no scratches and everything works. I haven¡¯t tried to activate it and get service yet so I¡¯m not sure how that will go, it took my SIM card on the first try though. It came with a generic charger in a generic box. No SIM card removal tool or earphones. I would definitely recommend this product so far.
            "
"1751","So far so good.. phone was clean..shopping was as expected. But will write full review over the next few months to make sure all components are lasting..
            "
"1752","Phone works well, nothing out of the ordinary not used to the battery life, got mine from bluspry tho I actually ordered from techventure, I do not know if that was due to them having it In stock,overall satisfied with my purchaseUpdate ended up trading that phone for the iPhone 7plus it¡¯s a a better deal in the long run and way more battery
            "
"1753","casing was flawless but theres a big indent in the middle of the screen preventing me from putting a screen guard on it without having to look at a huge air bubble. otherwise, it's great. just be sure who you buy from
            "
"1754","This phone completely shut off after 3 months of using it. Throughout the night it turned ff and never turned back on Luckily I had an upgrade but thank you amazon for selling me a half working phone.
            "
"1755","Phone arrived in good cosmetic condition for a refurbished phone. However, after one week of use the battery lasts about an hour. Sometimes less. We now have to spend more money to get the battery replaced.
            "
"1756","the phone came well packaged, but started heating up as soon as i started using it. i lost it few days ago, but i dont really regret it. exterior condition was ok. but a refurbished can be way better, this one was a mess
            "
"1757","The phone itself is great. One very annoying thing is not being able to turn off the camera noise. It doesn't seem like a big issue but when you are taking pictures with friends it is extremely annoying. Apparently any phone from japan has this noise unable to be diabled.
            "
"1758","I purchased this phone as an upgrade from a 6 plus because my old iPhone had touch disease. I received the 6S and the battery life is garbage. Charges to 65% overnight, and steadily tanks during the day. Good working phone, but a bad battery will kill any review.
            "
"1759","Very good iPhone 6s unlocked 64Gb gold colorIs refurbished and unlocked. I was able to use it with an international sim card (an Italian one)The condition outside was perfect. The battery status too...I gave the phone to my father and immediately he thought it was a new phone for himIf I'll find another offer I'll buy another one for sure. Thank you!
            "
"1760","Iphone came scratched does not look brand new you can tell iphone has been used... also battery life doesn¡¯t last to long..and the  phone freezes i got my iphone with Breed I would not suggest going with this company
            "
"1761","The phone did not work properly. For regular phone calls you could only hear the person you were calling but they couldn't hear you and there was always a lot of static. The Facetime option worked a little. The seller didn't seem too concerned when we contacted her about the issues but we were refunded promptly.
            "
"1762","Works
            "
"1763","Volume button does not shut off the camera. Battery life came in at 90% And after 26 days it is down to 79%. I am sending it back.
            "
"1764","Phone had minor scratches on the back of the case, and a small flaw on the glass front toward an edge so it doesn't affect the display. After a couple of days of almost constant yay-I-got-a-new-phone usage, I detect no problems with battery life or operation. Getting my unlocked phone set up for my provider T-Mobile took an easy five minutes at their store. Seller BREEM shipped the phone with USB charging cord and 110v plug that are not made by Apple, but do their jobs just fine so far.
            "
"1765","Phone is horrible. It shakes, calls people randomly and you can¡¯t text. I would never buy a refurbished phone again from this site. So disappointed
            "
"1766","It came with the battery at low health so it doesn¡¯t hold a charge all day but overall solid phone the battery has been recognized by apple as a deffect
            "
"1767","The entire LCD Screen turned pitch black in 2 days. Could not turn it on/off and completely unresponsive. What a terribly horrible product. I also noticed the back turned hot very quickly before the inexplicable ending of the screen.
            "
"1768","The iPhone 6s I got works amazing would definitely recommend it to my friends and it didn¡¯t come with any scratches or any damage it¡¯s practically brand new and this phone works pretty good for whatever you need including gaming.
            "
"1769","Battery life isn¡¯t great and the screen came with a couple scratches but otherwise functions perfectly. Can¡¯t expect the world from a refurbished phone. I¡¯m pleasantly pleased with it.
            "
"1770","At first I was very skeptical about buying this because 1. The bad reviews will have you worrying if you're getting a broken or unusable phone, and 2. Because it's used/refurbished. But after it came a day earlier and I finished unboxing it, I can say you're getting an extremely solid product, looked brand new, felt amazing, and runs smoothly. Certainly getting your money's worth. Just make sure you get a case along with it if you're a clumsy person like me.
            "
"1771","All good thanks
            "
"1772","The phone did not last more than an hour using the internet the battery was total garbage other than that there was no scratches on the item but the item was returned

            "
"1774","*UPDATE* I went to the Apple store to get my battery replaced, and they wouldn¡¯t touch it, because there was a run down, after market battery installed. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!The battery is totally run down- takes forever to charge, then immediately begins to lose charge. I paid too much money to be sold such a subpar product.
            "
"1775","Great product. I received my phone earlier than expected with 87% battery life. I do reccomend this particular company. The phone showed up with no signs of wear, completely factory reset. 10/10 would buy again.
            "
"1776","I bought this phone to replace my old one which was the same model. Everything works normally EXCEPT for the inability to shut the camera shutter sound off. I'm not able to respond to my Snapchats in public or at school because everyone hears the loud shutter sound. But other than that, it was an alright deal.
            "
"1777","The battery shows a little bit of age, as it doesn't have that fresh long-lasting and quick-charging performance that a new phone has, but otherwise this phone is pristine and fantastic.
            "
"1778","The microphone doesn't work well (well talking on the phone it is very muffled), I should have sent it back, but was leaving town for ten days. Disappointed.

            "
"1781","At first glance, the phone appeared to be in good condition...As soon as I started making phone calls, I realized the ear piece did not work. I could only make phone calls on speaker phone, because the sound was so quiet.I also noticed the battery life was awful. I would barely use the phone and it would have to be charged 3-4 times a day.
            "
"1782","I am really happy with my purchase.
            "
"1783","i love it although i will admit i was on edge about buying this product because of all the mixed review i got the 16 gb rose gold by deal fisher the phone look and workes perfectly no scratches on it at all and i was easily able to connect my service to it  hands down will by again if i break this one
            "
"1784","Phone itself is great. If I need to buy another phone, I  will buy again from this seller. Battery on the other hand doesn¡¯t last

"1785","I could have given this iphone 6s a 4 star, because it arrived dirty, may be it's a refurbished iphone.  The earpiece is hardly audible.  I had to spend hours to clean the dirt off the earpiece. After cleaning the phone, everything seems fine so I decided to keep it for special use.  However, I will not buy another refurbished phone from this vendor (The Platinum Deals).

            "
"1788","Bought this phone as a birthday present for my boyfriend. Seems to be overall good phone, good battery life and regular response speed, although it¡¯s unfortunate that the screen has minor problems such as not registering when buttons are held down when recording video it will randomly stop, seems to be a sensor issue. Overall a good phone besides that issue.
            "
"1789","very deep scratches!! not as good as it says! hate it! I bought a 5s from another seller and it came as new.

"1790","In the past I had iPhones and then switched to an Android.  I'm glad I switched back to an iPhone.  It has been more reliable for me.  I bought an Otter Box case and haven't broken it yet.  The phone was in good condition, and I'm happy with it.
            "
"1791","I was skeptical about buying a phone online but it was shipped fast and packaged just fine. It¡¯s in great condition no dings or scratches and so far it works great. This is my first day using it so if anything changes I¡¯ll update.

"1792","Love it. A year later and it works oerfectly still. Everything came in great condition. It had the phone and a charger.

"1793","I needed a new phone and didn¡¯t want to purchase one brand new through my phone company, so I ordered this one. Luckily I ordered it before reading the reviews because had I seen all the negative feedback I definitely would not have. I am very happy with the phone, works great! Got here in 4 days, Looks brand new, worked as soon as I put my SIM in and came with a screen protector already on.
            "
"1794","Very disappointed with the quality of phone. Ringer is not working after few days of use. It goes on Mute even without hitting side Mute Button which means you wont hear ring bell if someone is calling you. This is very bad since it can be very damaging in an emergency situation. I contacted Seller for help with changing the phone but there was NO Reply from the Seller. I strongly recommend not to buy this product again.
            "
"1795","I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box , and saw what appeared to be a brand new phone with not a mark on it. I plugged in my Cricket sim card and was on my way.  Very happy with this purchase.
            "
"1796","I got my phone and everything seemed perfect about it, until I'd have phone calls and people would say that they could barely hear me. So I tested it out by recording with a lot of background noise, and everything sounds so mumbled and far away. I really need this to be replaced. It's frustrating making important phone calls to my boss and having her tell me we'll talk later because she can't understand me.

            "
"1798","Es muy buen telefono hecepto por la bateria que medio se baja pero lo demas esta perfecto.
            "
"1799","Refurbished  iPhone 6S delivered must not have been tested prior to sending. Battery life would go from 100% to 0% with less then 1 hour of use. Battery test shows 95% life but would discharge within an hour. Called and customer service did not seem to care and offered $20 or just send it back. Very frustrating since took me a while to move all my apps etc to this phone only to find out that it was a piece of junk.

            "

"1804","Worked great and received as described.
            "
"1805","Was kinda lerious at first after ordering and noticing some more of the bad reviews but once I got it it seemed like BRAND new with one very very small scuff mark on the back from setting it on a table perhaps and no scratches on the screen very pleased and arrived 4 days early
            "
"1806","I just received my phone and it is BEAUTIFUL! I honestly could not tell if it was refurbished or brand new. The only thing I could find was a couple teeny-tiny scratches on the back- I mean they are so small. The phone arrived in 2 days with standard free shipping! Very happy with this product and will definitely be ordering again!
            "
"1807","Can¡¯t beat the price. I bought this iPhone 6s for my wife, it has a giant hard drive of 64 gigs  which she needs for videos and pictures of the kids. Works great!!!
            "
"1808","I wanted to wait to give an honest opinion/review. Got this for my daughter because I had one from my job. Arrived in great condition. Seller had a signature resquest upon delivery which was kind of a pain but at the most was the best thing that they could do so that my product was delivered safe and TO ME. So far she still loves it, no issues, or doubts. This was actually loke brand new! I forgot if I ordered a refurbish or brand new phone.... that says a lot!
            "
"1809","Love it! It has literally no scratches, it looks brand new and came with a screen proctor on it. I was a little nervous because of the mixed reviews but I couldn¡¯t be happier that I decided to buy it!
            "
"1810","Works well as a camera, which is why i bought it. Battery life is a little weak.
            "
"1811","I am unable to use cellular data which is a pain. I can only iMessage and use the internet on WiFi. Phone is in good condition and works well otherwise.
            "
"1812","We bought this phone in January 2018. We have been having problems out of the battery since may now it doesn¡¯t even come on....
            "
"1813","Everything was good, but would have like to have the headphones included.
            "
"1814","Bought the phone 2 weeks in and it's still perfect. Everything works. No scratch or dent or wear and tare. Looks brand new, but its refurbish. My daughter loved it. It's exactly what I got through the mail. Unlock and I can use it through tmobile. I've recently bought it off another buyer,it said it was unlock but when I got it phone was not unlock so I had to return it and they gave me a full refund. Other then that, it was a 3 weeks waiting period for the return and the refund.If you're thinking of buying one from this seller, I would recommend it.
            "
"1815","The product said to be refurbished. I dont mind the aesthetical details such as dents and scratches but I DO care about receiving a said to be refurbished cellphone that has a battery that lasts only a few hours and even shows in the battery stats to only hold 78% of charge. Having known this i wouldnt have bought it but since i live in Argentina i cant even give it back...i guess i¡¯ll have to spend extra money and buy a new battery.
            "
"1816","I was really scared ordering a refurbished phone since the reviews were mixed but I¡¯m really happy!No scratches or anything, the phone starts up perfectly!It even came with a screen protector on the phone along with an Apple cord and charger. So far so good and if this isn¡¯t updated than you¡¯ll know i was happy with the phone :)
            "
"1817","Absolutely awesome phone, no complaints. Ordered one more for my sister hope its going to be good as well!
            "
"1818","Worked fine for about a  month then started having a lot of trouble with it...lately it just freezes and locks up, the screen stays stuck and i have to do hard resets almost all day. I have no clue whats wrong with it. Really bummed out about it.
            "
"1819","Totally impressed with this seller Chubbiestech.  My phone arrived a day early, by certified signature mail.  The box and phone look totally new.  I changed out my sim and.....up and running instantly.  I was not expecting it to include a glass screen cover already placed on screen, a sim removal tool, and a hard case.  I broke my last phone dropping it without a case or screen protector.  These little things mean a lot.
            "
"1820","I've had this phone now for 2 months and it works perfectly.  Buying re-furbished saves a lot of money.  I'll never buy new again!  I love it.
            "
"1821","Received my iPhone 6s 64 gig this week. I was expecting a few knicks and dings on the phone but to my surprise, it was immaculate. It even came with a free screen protector already installed. works just like a new phone as well, I am a very satisfied customer.. Will definitely be purchasing form Chubbiestech again.
            "
"1822","Purchased for my son and the Product was as described. My son is satisfied. However, the battery life doesn¡¯t last as long, but he does keep his charger on hand, (typical teenager) LOL
            "
"1823","This product is very good, I had an amazing time with this phone and at a very good price, the phone was phenomenal. As this was my first Iphone I didn't expect much, I only wanted it to make calls and text and the screen to be big enough for my hands. It did all of this and more, I must say that work was very amazingly done on this phone, now if you'd like to know why I gave it one star I will tell you this.The relationship I had with this phone didn't work out. On the first day it worked perfectly fine, on the second day it would overheat and take a moment to come back on. On the third day it did the same thing mulitple times with very little use, on the fourth day it cut off for a few hours with very little work done with it. on the fifth day it cut out entirely and didn't come back on until two days later. Don't buy this product, save your money, buy an android.
            "
"1824","It can in pretty nice packaging and the quality of the device is better than I expected. A minor gripe is the battery capacity is 89% which is still completely usable but it would have been nice to get a completely new one for the price
            "
"1825","Got it and works but....The screen is all scratched. Finewiththat ifits fine scratches but, two major scratches, deep, on it next to home button. Quite annoying.Last time i go with a refurbished.Get prepared for stuff like this. Refurbished is not what they make it sound to be.
            "
"1826","The phone works perfectly. No scratches. Even came with a glass screen protector. The battery is so much better than my old iPhone which tells me this one is fairly new.
            "
"1827","As expected.  As new not a single scratch. Unlocked, using it in Europe. Been using it for 2 weeks now everything works fine.  Got it from DealFisher. As mentioned here in other reviews no box and no original accessories but that was expected.
            "
"1828","The quality of the phone is like new, no stripes or hits, seems like new.It did not come with headphones and the charger is not original.The battery is not lasting much but that could be an iPhone general issue.The touch of the screen works perfect and in general everything is working as new.
            "
"1829","Small problems, overall it works and is worth the price.
            "
"1830","I have had this phone for over a year. Could not be more pleased. Have not had a single glitch!
            "
"1831","iPhone came in great condition, it comes with a generic charger not the apple brand, but it works perfect. The phone is in great condition and unlocked as advertised.
            "
"1832","I bought my iPhone from dealfisher. I paid 250 in total and overall I¡¯m satisfied. It looks like new and the phone itself works properly. The reason I¡¯m giving it four stars is that the battery runs out extremely fast which is probably why the original owner gave it back, but I got what I paid for, so I¡¯m not mad.
            "
"1833","The Phone is a refurbished unit, so you can tell it¡¯s not new, but the most notable thing was the battery life.
            "
"1834","I purchased this for my niece who lives in Texas.  She says she loves it and it works great for her.  I'm happy!
            "
"1835","The phone volume cannot be heard! It exactly stopped in 90 days (just after warranty)
            "
"1836","I would rather a 4.5 it is amazing works perfectly except it has not been sending me I message notifications. Other than that no complaintsEdit: now it has started sending notifacations so my review has been changed to 5 stars
            "
"1837","All these bad reviews are a mixture of sellers! Pay attention to the Seller! I ordered from ChubbiesTech and literally no scratches no negativity whatsoever. Just don¡¯t waste your time reading other reviews! Seriously order from ChubbiesTech. I love my Rose Gold IPhone! GET YOU ONE!
