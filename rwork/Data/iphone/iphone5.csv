"1","Original Review: The phone is really like-new. Looks great works well so far. It was well-protected in the beastly packaging it arrived in. We received it today and immediately added it to our AT&T account without any problem. Our one main issue****** The charger that came with it doesn't work!!!! Grrrr.Update: WOW what a piece of junk!!! I can't begin to describe the problems with this phone. We have had it for 3 days and so far it has we've noticed the right side doesn't respond well to touch (almost impossible to type the letter P on the keyboard), it has started shutting off randomly (currently won't turn back on), it poltergeist freaks out on us (open/close apps and type gibberish on its own, etc). Last time it shut off involuntarily, we saw stripes across the screen before it faded to black. This thing is a dud. SO disappointed. My husband needs this phone for work, so now he is in a really tough situation!!! We will see if their customer service is any good....I'll report back soon. -.-

"2","<U+00A0>I bought one in Jan, 2018 and the iPhone 5C I received was in cosmetically great condition. The biggest flaw is that the BATTERY BLEW UP inside just after using it for 4 months, late April 2018. Battery is pushing up on glass and will no longer power on. Also I am outside the return window, which closed on Feb 9, 2018 and product support window, closed on Mar 11, 2018. This is supposed to be ""Certified Refurbished"" ? After paying $149.99 never again will I buy from this seller or ""Certified Refurbished"". Don't waste your time, buy from Apple or elsewhere that details what ""Certified Refurbished"" means to them.
            "
"3","I have read all the poor reviews. This was not the case with the phone I bought. Although I am unsure if they sent me a 8GB or 16GB (I ordered 16) It worked completely fine. It said it was a AT&T phone on the network but worked perfectly for my T-Mobile service. I never had not one problem at all. Sadly about 6 months after I bought I dropped it in water and it hasn't worked since. But that was my fault! I will not purchase again bc of poor reviews and fear of being one of the unlucky customers. Phone was great & I loved it!
            "
"4","This phone came in perfect condition, it is like new. No dust even in the crevices or earpiece. Can not find a scratch or ding anywhere. Very happy with the phone. Battery life is 4-5 hours of continuous use but last all day, even with teenager usage.
            "
"5","It is always great when you buy something and it is EXACTLY as presented and maybe even better. The phone arrived (without a lot of extra packaging I might add) and looks brand new and works great. I took it to the T-Mobile store for activation and the clerk took it through all the paces (stolen - NO, needs a sim card - No, is memory sufficient - YES) and finally reluctantly activated my sim card and let me walk out of the store hundreds of dollars richer and very happy!!
            "
"6","So far, so good. Will update my review, just in case. It is my first time to order a refurbished phone. It is also my first time to buy an iPhone. My last phone was a Samsung Galaxy S5. So, I picked the 5C as an introduction to iPhones. I do have an iPad mini 3 that I had now synced it with. I was very worried, I have to admit. The phone turned out looking brand new and working just fine.
            "
"7","Update: I originally gave this phone a 5 star review. Now here we are 7 months later and the phone doesn't work, it won't turn on at all. I've done the hard reset before when it did this about 2 months ago and it worked. That reset method doesn't work this time, I plan on taking it to the Apple store for a diagnostic. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!! I wouldn't worth the risk if I had to do it all over again. Save yourself the $200+.I bought this phone for my son as a Christmas gift and the phone came in excellent condition and it was easy to setup. I just went to the T-Mobile store and they just cut his current SIM card down to fit this phone and we were all set. My son loves the phone and the features!
            "
"8","The refurb does not seem to be the best. The screen is literally popping off the phone. The glass is not broken, the case is not cracked the screen just raises up on it's own.Worked great for about 8 weeks then separation from the body started happening. Phone looks new otherwise.It has been kept in a Speck case.It is a shame to have a nice looking phone but have a need to keep it patched together with tape.
            "
"9","I was a little sceptic to get a certified refurbished iphone but as it is getting discontinued and I really like the compact size of this model, I took the risk.  I'm really glad about my decision. The iphone really is as described ""look like new and work like new"".  The supplier, VIP Outlet Inc, is doing a tremendous refurbishment work, and if the opportunity comes I would not hesitate to try with them again! Continue doing the best as you're doing!
            "
"10","The phone turns on and has a decent battery life - however it has a pink hue to the screen. It also has scratches to all four corners. I requested a replacement, but they can only send a replacement once they have received the defective phone. So, my son would be without a phone for an indefinite amount of time. With his health issues, I am not in a position to have him phoneless. They suggested to purchase another phone and send the defective phone back for a refund.... who has an extra $170 dollars to pay for 2 phones..... if I had that kind of money, I wouldn't have been purchasing him a refurb phone in the first place.....
            "
"11","It looks brand new! Comes with a charger and plastic film on both sides of the phone. Shipped quickly.
            "
"12","In the end, a good deal on a great phone.  However, listing stated it was for GSM (AT&T) ONLY.  When it arrived, first thing I noticed was a Verizon sticker.  Apparently starting with iPhone 5,  Verizon and AT&T phones both have SIM slots (not used if Verizon) - but listing stated otherwise.  KLAMP customer service was easy to deal with, explained the tech and quick considering Christmas season.I am middle aged with a decent income, could get in line with the teenagers and adult ""Lemmings"" every time Apples ""blesses"" the world with a new phone.  But if you wait 12 months or so, you can save $100 - $300 and still have a great phone.Want to have some fun; if you know someone who can't wait for the next iPhone - ask them exactly how they will actually use the new ""features"" they can't live without.  9 out of 10 go blank for about 30 seconds.  Don't misunderstand me, I love the iPhone but these annual ""new"" phones have only minor changes applicable to 80% of the users.  Wait a model or two, then you actually notice the improvements.  Just my opinion - Get Off My Lawn, you kids!  Sincerely, Ward Cleaver.
            "
"13","Great phone. Refurbished, like new. I was concerned because it is a refurbished phone but I have not had any problems at all.
            "
"14","The phone stopped working 4 months later. I don't know why they offer a 3 month warranty. Usually Refurbished items offer a Year. Be careful. The audio stopped working and no longer hear phone calls and it blinks. A month after first getting the phone I dismissed the sound issues thinking I had more time. Guess not. Will never buy Refurb again.
            "
"15","It's an iPhone what else you can say.Worked flawlessly. Item exactly as described. No scratches on the screen powered up perfect.As some one who like green I was very satisfied with color.
            "
"16","DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.THE PHONE WAS STOLEN!!Amazing it is a prime item and called to get it turned on and Verizon said there is a police report on it, can¡¯t turn on. WOW
            "
"17","Ordered this iPhone as an extra. When it arrived, it had a sticker that read ""Verizon"". I researched the model number and it was a CDMA/GSM phone that supported almost all CDMA/GSM/WCDMA/LTE frequencies. Works great on T-Mobile.Phone arrived in almost perfect condition with a 3rd party cable and charger. I was amazed that the screen was unmarred and the case itself had no scratches.I imagine that receiving a CDMA capable phone in such great condition was the luck of the draw. Definitely worth the money.
            "
"18","Phone was in great condition but returned it because the camera sounds could not be turned off.Update,  apparently all phones that have been refurbished cannot mute camera sound, phone was in good working order and arrived when promised
            "
"19","I used this phone for about a year and it was ok but I have it to a friend for her son to use and now it¡¯s blocked. I¡¯m told the original owner probably stopped making payments on it and there is nothing I can do.
            "
"20","I received my iPhone 5c today it looked great when I first opened it. When I got it it was dead so I put it to charge. After about 30 minutes of charging the screen on the phone started to bow up. I come to the conclusion the battery in it was bad and was swelling up to almost burst. I am now having to pay $60 to get the battery replaced and haven't even got the phone charged all the way yet to see how it works when it is turned on. I bought this phone was my mother and am VERY unhappy with my purchase. It is suppose to be like new and have no problems. Would love to send it back and get it fixed or get another one but I had to wait long enough to get this one in the mail and there is no telling if I send this back and get another one that that one won't be defeated as well.
            "
"21","Wow I am very impressed with this phone. I purchased this phone for my son for Christmas and it was very very nice and new. Although it is refurbished it is just as good as a brand new one and looks even better with  the cute back cover  on the backs of the phone. I was hesitant in buying this due to the fact that it wasn't coming directly from the company but as I read on it really is it is just refurbished. The phone is excellent and I do give this 5 stars I will definitely order from them again!
            "
"22","I bought this in July and already I'm having battery problems. It hasn't even been six months and it's now dying at 80-90%. Sometimes I will take it off the charger downstairs, walk upstairs with it, open messages, and it will die before I make it into my bedroom. I tried recalibrating the battery and factory resetting the phone. I'm going to try and take it to Apple tomorrow but it will probably cost me a pretty penny to fix. I am so frustrated because I've had other refurbished iPhones and this is the first time the battery has went kaput within a few months of owning the product.
            "
"23","Was waiting to write a review to determine the overall life of the phone.  I purchased this iphone in Oct 2018 and am disappointed that it's only lasted 5 months.  The battery started to deplete quickly approx 1-1/2 months ago and now only works when it's plugged into a charger.  With a full charge the battery drains within a few minutes so very unhappy with this purchase.*Update on Iphone 5c.  Was informed that the problem was with the software installed on some Iphone 5c models.  Unable to update the software so the only way to continue use of the phone is having the  phone charging while in use.
            "
"24","I brought this phone for my 11 year old daughter and she loves it.It works great and looks good.I received it just when they said I would.She has had it over a month with no problems
            "
"25","i always thought certified refurbished were something great or something functional with changes in the parts which were not functional. I understand that refurbished can be tricky to but i did not expect an iPhone worth 200+ dollars which looked like it was never been taken care of by previous owner. This was an accidental purchase for me but i was not able to cancel it and thought maybe since i bought it anyway i would give it a try, but as soon as the phone got in my hands  , i feel bad saying this, but knew i had to return it. That rarely happens to me.The other reviews are honest and you should read it carefully and understand your requirements.
            "
"26","I love this phone, but there is one thing thats bugging me. It looked nice / no chips / clean screen, came quickly and mostly as expected. Although ever since I got it, it has issues charging. I'm guessing it's the charging port itself because I bought a new apple certified cord (i'll randomly get a pop up when its having difficulty charging saying I'm not using the right charger). I get the same message with my new cord that I got directly from apple. So I think the charger it came with was likely the right one, it's just an issue with the charging port. Ill have to move it in weird ways to get it to charge, and the charging icon pops on and off until I find the perfect spot. This is a huge annoyance, but I don't feel the seller sent it knowing it had issues. I know this phone was refurbished so I'm guessing that it was just something that had gotten overlooked. Although I really wish therr was an easy way to fix this - because its getting increasingly more difficult to charge it at all and I haven't had it very long.
            "
"27","Received the product fairly quick, the phone i ordered had small scratches on the back and dirt in the cracks of the phone. After using it for a few days i can say that the battery life is pretty much shot.Not happy with this at all, This iphone definitely doesnt seen refurbished at all. Contacted seller regarding issue and will update review if resolved.
            "
"28","The phone arrived the same day I ordered it through my Prime account.  The phone came in a generic white box, but was well packaged. It included earphones and a wall charger. Regardless of some of the comments on this site, this phone is NOT compatible with Verizon Wireless! I tried to activate it at a Verizon Corporate Store and after a couple of attempts using different SIM cards, they gave up and told me it wasn't compatible. I really liked the phone (it's for my mom) since it looks brand NEW so instead of returning it to the seller, I took it to T-Mobile. They quickly activated it. I got a good deal on an international plan and a free SIM card so it all worked out in the end.
            "
"29","Bought this for my 12 year old. Had a couple of  minor dings but we use cases anyway so no one will ever know. The phone came with 3 free months of service through a prepaid carrier called Mint Mobile that runs off of TMobile. Had never heard of it so we decided to give it a try and it works well and the plans are pretty inexpensive (no unlimited data which is fine for a kid who is usually connected to Wifi). We are going to be purchasing another one in June for our middle daughter to have for her birthday.
            "
"30","I bought this iPhone for my daughter because of the price. She does not have any complaints, it works as we expected. Receiving and calling and the apps work without any issues. The iPhone is smaller than an average iPhone but she likes it because it fits in her little purse and because it is yellow! So far no issues or complaints. Great product!
            "
"31","not a big apple fan but got talked into getting this for the wifi texting and wifi calling and facetime because my android kept missing texts and facetime is all the rage with my gf, I had to modify my sim (cut it to super small size and grind it down so its thinner) to use their micro sim card, the cable the gave me with this shorted out in a week but other than just the horrible apple OS it does what its supposed to I guess.
            "
"32","this was a great in-between phone. My son dropped my phone in the toilet and I was holding out until the new iPhone. Buying a rebuilt was a perfect, inexpensive solution!  My only complaint about the phone was that it was an Asian phone so the camera had the sound on and it couldn't be deactivated. Other than that, no issues at all.
            "
"33","The phone appearance and function is perfect. It looked brand new and worked fine right out of the box. The lightning cable provided was defective. Since this was a replacement, not an Apple original as they indicated it would be (same as the charger), I was not surprised. Fortunately the problem was resolved quickly and I received a partial refund.The phone battery was depleted on arrival, it would be nice to take the time to charge all phones before shipping as a discharged battery can suffer damage.
            "
"34","I got it for my sister, and she absolutely loved it! I will buy again soon.
            "
"35","The  phone came to us with no forward working camera.  The charger would not charge the phone and the flash light would not work.  I was surprised all oo these items were not confirmed to work before they left the shop.
            "
"36","Got it, looks new, feels new. Now I need to set it up and will be back for more review.Charger looks fake, but then this is my first phone!New edit : feels great, battery life is probably not the best compared to family phones I used before BUT THEN its refurbished.ANOTHER NEW EDIT: I really enjoy my first phone, works fine with straight talk! I'm using AT&T!
            "
"37","Sent me a cdma verizon phone with gsm capabilities not a gsm phone like the add says. It would not work on a gsm carrier like att or tmobile
            "
"38","VERY good, product and seller!! I'm really happy!
            "
"39","Got this for our daughters 7th birthday. She was so surprised and loved it. Easily added her to our AT&T plan. It¡¯s been great for us in tracking our daughter and great in entertaining her. No longer in need lugging around an iPad when she has a pocket friendly device.
            "
"40","I don't usually write reviews but this phone made me write one. After reading all the good reviews i decided to purchase this phone as a temp since my iPhone is being fixed. It seemed like an affordable backup phone so i bought it. It came accordingly and i charged it because it was low battery. When i took it to school i made a phone call and when i hung up it turned off. I said ok let me turn it back on no prob. Well, the low battery little red bar picture appeared on the screen telling me to connect it to the charger. MIND YOU I CHARGED THIS PHONE FOR 100% WORTH OF BATTERY AND IT DIED WITHIN 5 MINUTES OF USING IT & WOULDNT TURN BACK ON UNLESS I CONNECTED IT BACK TO THE CHARGER!!! i am extremely disappointed, i don't stay at home all the time i do go out and it sucks not having a phone when doing so. i would give this no stars but didn't have the option too. don't buy. returning immediately. how sad!
            "
"41","Hello! I'm from Venezuela and recently I bought this iPhone model. I just received the phone 3 days ago and I finally can setup the phone and I realize that the iphone has a pale pink spot on the screen, also has some bubbles on the screen. Sometimes de screen doesn't work. I'm so mad because for me is a lot of money and also It took me so much to get it. I want a replacement or the money back. I understand the phone is refurbished, but at least it should be working as well with no damage like this. I refuse to pay for a new one. The worst is I can't return the iphone for a replacement because I'm not living in US and here in my country we don't have UPS to send it back.
            "
"42","Seemed great until shortly after the 90-day warranty expired, ironically.  Now for the last several days, it's saying it won't read the SIM card and my daughter can not get any service except every once in a great while it suddenly works for about 30 seconds.  The AT&T store tried everything, even gave it a new SIM card, but the problem is apparently with the phone, not the service.  We were hopeful it would still be under warranty because it was purchased as a Christmas gift just 4 months ago, but naturally ... it was only covered under a 90-day warranty.  I am not happy.  :-(
            "
"43","Well, the phone was great at first. It did everything i wanted it to do, but the battery life sucked. I would charge the phone all night, then during the day the battery life would rapidly deteriorate. Sometimes by 2pm the phone would be on 20%. Ive had the phone since September, and now it just doesn't work. The touch screen stopped working. I can't put my passcode in to get into the phone. Its really frustrating. The phone worked for 3 months, but thats not good enough for me.
            "
"44","My phone came at my door stop a week after I purchased which is great! It is working great and charging well.
            "
"45","Very surprised how great condition the phone is! Very happy with my purchase. Just a little scared its gonna wear off in 3 months how some of these comments say it did. But other than that very pleased
            "
"46","I am not too please with my phone. I'm will have to return it for a new one soon. First thing is the camera seems to have something wrong with it. When I take pictures or do a video it looks like there is something on my camera. Secondly I have to talk on speaker phone when I'm on a phone call. I cancan barely hear the person on the other line and the same goes for them barley hearing me. But lastly I can't even use the phone with the company I'm with since the phone isn't compatible which I don't understand because it's an unlocked phone. So I can use my internet when I'm not around wifi. I'm a frustrated about this because now I have to send the phone back and I'm not even sure if I will get another phone that will be compatible with my phone company.
            "
"47","This iPhone was in brand new condition and even had the safety screen sticker when it arrived. The seller was also friendly enough to include a typed thank you note inside the box. The charger and wall adapter was also included! Thank you. Such a great price & great quality.
            "
"48","So far so good. Got it refurbished so I know something was wrong with it originally. When I press the area around the home button it seems loose as if the glue came undone underneath. Nothing has come out yet; keeping my fingers crossed.
            "
"49","After initially getting the phone, I was having a hard time getting anyone to service it. But you will need a universal sim card and then all is good. The product came on time and was in good shape. Just wish they would make the ID number bigger to read and clear.
            "
"50","I only had the phone for one week and i have to say it came just as described, no dents or scratches like brand new phone with serial number on the back. the only down  side was it only came with the  phone and non Apple charger which is not the best for charging so i  had to go buy a Apple I phone charger which works great. But beside that it work with my Metro PCS sim card and was able to upgrade to IOS 9.0 from OS 7 which come standard with the phone. So just an warning you may need to buy a new charger to get a descent charge.
            "
"51","I'm very happy! I ordered the green version which was being sold by DealFisher at the time. I was a little nervous about a refurbished phone but when it got here there weren't even any visible scuffs or scratches on it and it behaved as if it were brand new. I have had it for about 2 weeks so far and it has worked perfectly. It holds a charge for a few days (I don't use it constantly though). If I spot any issues I will update my review, but so far, I recommend this and couldn't be more satisfied with this purchase.
            "
"52","Very good
            "
"53","It looks really great - I haven't Given it to my son  because it's a gift for my  for Christmas so I'll let you know them,  but it looks fine and packaged nicely.  Thank You -  he will be using it as an I pod everything but a telephone because he's only nine
            "
"54","The phone arrived clean, the screen did not have any scratches. The back had few un-noticeable use marks BUT the battery kept dying from this first day! Whenever I open an app even when the phone is sufficiently charged (sometimes over 60 percent), it kept it dying. Once it's off, it will not turn on again until I connect it to the charger. I am returning the phone and getting a refund. Be aware, the batteries in these phones are probably old and not reliable anymore.
            "
"55","Overall was basically a brand new phone, obviously not the latest model but worked just as fast. I would buy another one if I had too
            "
"56","Phone stopped working in 2 weeks. Wont turn on, cant charge, cant hard reset, cant DFU reset, cant connect to iTunes. I got lucky and it died during the warranty time frame. Dont take a chance, yours may die the day the warranty expires. 0 stars!!!
            "
"57","Perfect condition.  Unlocked with AT&T.  Saved me time and money.  This was a replacement phone for my son.  My son is happy and so am I.
            "
"58","I bought for my daughter..had doubts..I was wrong! It works perfectly and we have had absolutely no problems! You can't even tell it's used! Amazon comes through again!
            "
"59","The actual phone is great, although there's no EarPods and the charger doesn't work. However, my carrier is AT&T so it really is GDSMA!Everything's okay, although there are a couple cracks so I recommend buying a case with it.
            "
"60","Great phone lasted one year before my teenager dropped it
            "
"61","I have been very impressed with this phone. I must admit, I was Very nervous buying a used phone. But it's been great!!  No Problems, I was soo nervous because I couldn't buy an extended warranty, lost many hours of sleep about no warranty.  And so far so good........I think the warranty expires in two or three weeks. So I hope it keeps on ringin!!
            "
"62","So far the phone is running perfectly fine. I had to sand down the sides of my micro sim for it to fit into the phone(luckily, it still works). For a refurbished phone, it's really great. for most of the time, it's a super responsive phone. I've had some instances of visual lag but it wasn't too big to notice. Satisfied with my purchase.update: months later and battery issues arise. from it dying at 20% to having the wrong percentage of charge displayed
            "
"63","At such a low price point, this model iPhone is ideal for those itching to make the jump from Android or for those who are using a smartphone for the first time. With its solid build quality, lengthy battery life, and the freedom to use it under any GSM compatible carrier due to it being unlocked, the 5c was a great purchase.
            "
"64","Bought this for my 8 year old daughter. Older model iPhone but worth the price. No issues so far, would recommend for starters.
            "
"65","Giving this product a one star review is too generous. I have barely had this phone for three months and it no longer works. It was not dropped, there was no water damage, it just randomly started turning off and wouldn't turn on again. Don't waste your time spending a lot of money on phones on Amazon. Go to your phone provider, buy a real phone with insurance and don't mess around with these people. I will never buy another phone off of Amazon, you shouldn't either.
            "
"66","This phone shipped fast and even came with an included free 1 year extended warranty.  It has some slight wear...a small ding on the plastic, which is expected from a refurbished unit.  It looks like the screen may have been replaced at one point, you can see some screen issues in the top right corner.  All in all, exactly what you expect to get for $100, but it's an iPhone.
            "
"67","After reading up on the phone I also ordered the at&t sim card to go with it.  When I got the phone I tried to set it up with tracfone.  When I checked the back of the phone it said the carrier used to be Verizon.  Tracfone is going to send me a sim for free and said it should work ok.  If not I will be sending the phone back.
            "
"68","This product is SUCK ! BROKE DOWN in the first day!!!! Battery dropped from 40%-0% !!!! SUPER SLOW  when it is still alive! Piece of junk never recommend buying it!
            "
"69","The phone is great condition. It had no blemishes, when delivered. However, every time you try to download anything from the App Store it runs at a snails pace. Also it keeps making you log back in and saying your password it wrong!
            "
"70","The phone is in good condition, you can't even tell it's used. It came 2 days after being ordered with standard shipping. However, I got it activated with my metro pcs sim card and got TERRIBLE signal with it, I also can't receive picture mail on it. I know it's not my service provider that's the issue because I have a metro pcs phone and get great service with it and can receive picture mail with no problem. I took the phone to an Apple store and they said it was a unlocked Verizon phone. It is a nice iphone and everything I expected except the signal being weak and picture mail not working.
            "
"71","Not happy with this phone. It came in had my localCarrier set it up and no matter what working SIM card I put in the phone it won't work. It has a Verizon tag on the back which leads me to believe it's a locked Verizon phone instead of an unlocked phone like stated in the ad description. Very disappointed especially after waiting a week for the item to ship to get it back and than it doesn't even work.

"72","Item was refurbished but you couldn't tell from a new one!!Only the box was an OEM one and this made it clear that it was a refurbished unit!As with most iPhones, it has a small screen but it's a great value for money at $180.
            "
"73","Bought this as a replacement phone and battery would die at 90 sometimes 97. Had to constantly keep it on a charger eventually got a new battery for it and worked fine
            "
"74","Love the color got the blue. Good price. Smaller than what expected and rated screen and camera a 4 not 5 bc of my bad eyes and small size of screen to take pics or just go on internet. Came with 3 months free mint phone service but never got signal so bought straighttalk plan for. Plus nostalgia of this phone made purchase special for me.
            "
"75","Disappointing had to return the phone back to the company to fix it or send a better one. First one didn¡¯t connect with the sim or wifi, plus It wouldn¡¯t stay on long enough to charge. 2nd another disappointment major charging issues even after it have been charging overnight. It will say 100% and still dies. Issues calling out & taking incoming calls.

"76","Having bought this refurbished iPhone 5c from Squaredeals Inc. - I initially was very happy with my purchase. But not even 4 months later, that warm feeling has long disappeared.Firstly, the accessories that are sent with this phone aren't apple certified which means that the charger they supplied wouldn't actually charge my phone. Also, I'm convinced that the 'Apple' headphones they sent through were fake as the sound quality is terrible and the insides of the earbuds rattle loudly when shaken... neither of these happen with actual Apple products.The first three months of having the phone went great until I fell out of the 90day-refund period, at which point things went very wrong. At around day 110, the front-facing camera and flashlight stopped working (along with a few other sporadic functionality glitches). When i emailed Squaredeals through Amazon, i then embarked on the most useless, rude and frustrating email dialogue with whoever was on the other side of this 'help desk'. They're absolutely useless, so if you have a problem - DO NOT BOTHER EMAILING THEM! IT IS A WASTE OF TIME! No one actually answers your questions and it's mostly one-sentence replies asking for your serial number (OVER AND OVER AGAIN) or saying ""take it to your nearest apple store"".(oh yes, and after about 8 emails of them repeatedly telling me to take it to an apple store FINALLY they gave in and said that they'd take responsibility and have a look at it... but I would have to send back the phone with all its original packaging and accessories, pay for shipping out of my own pocket AND THEN it would take TWO WEEKS for them to get back to me with a prognosis... and of course I'd have to pay for any repairs they did. Bollocks. Bollocks. Bollocks.)I then went through the Square Trade website, which was a lot more helpful as you submit a form and they phone you back (that was at least sanity-saving). Once they contacted me, i was told that the warranty I was ENCOURAGED to buy was absolutely useless as it was not compatible with my phone. AND it turns out that they would only cover me up to the value of $12 anyways.So the operator who called me (who was in fact super helpful, I must say) told me that they would refund me my warranty (thanks for my 12 bucks back, guys) but that I was basically on my own.So NOW, its not even been 4 months and NOW I HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER PHONE!?! Really poor and frustrating service paired with a potentially even worse product has made this an absolute waste of time and money.DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND MOVE ON!!!
            "
"77","The phone is great... except that I can't turn off the camera shutter sound (yes, I muted it). It looks like my phone came from Japan originally, or something, because the shutter sound is also very loud. It would have been nice to get one that doesn't have another country's restrictions on it.
            "
"78","I'm dissapointted I purchased this item april 27th for a apple it shows on photo all that it comes with it didn't come with ear pace and key to open the sim and all that is promoted on photo with purchase
            "
"79","Very pleased with this phone, I questioned buying a refurbished phone or any electrical product for that matter. I thought I give this a try, the pricemade it very affordable. And it works great.
            "
"80","I love the it!!! To start, I accepted the free shipping, and it still arrived within two days of being shipped. Secondly, the packaging was decent. In the box, I received a set of headphones, a lightening cable, and cube. The phone looks damn near brand new, and works just as well. I have no complaints about this purchase. If you are deciding whether or not to purchase one, let me help you out: you better get it before its gone!
            "
"81","This is my replacement phone. It IS definitely a refurbed phone... keep that in mind. It doesn't hold a charge the way a new phone does. But I'm overall satisfied with it. It's speed is great, and everything about it is great. I just carry extra chargers now in my car and at work as well as at home just to keep its battery up.
            "
"82","Useful product for what is is. No a great price to performance ratio. Overprice for it's features. Typical product type from an oligopoly.
            "
"83","The phone was easy to set up but upon opening the box showed clear signs of previous use. Both bottom corners and one of the top corners show evidence that it was dropped, the sim card tray was bent and after some finagling I was able to get it back in with the card. Over all the phone works but it does not look like new as many of the reviews had claimed.
            "
"84","I've bought several used or refurbished Iphones in the past, but this is the best Ive ever purchased!  Works great.  Battery holds a charge well.  Lots of memory.
            "
"85","I ordered this iPhone 5C for my niece and went to try and get it activated and it would not let me do any thing with it. Do not order this phone. It is not unlocked by any means. Yes you can turn it on and connect to WIFI but that's about it.
            "
"86","I bought this phone for my Mother in Law. From the time the phone arrived she had little complaints that I thought meant she did not know how to use the phone well. Turns out not to be so! Eventually when my wife and I went over to visit, I realised that the phone was faulty!I then contacted them and no response!!!!...DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!
            "
"87","The phone was in great shape just as they had promised.  It came with a charge, which I appreciated, but no instruction to set up a passcode.  The 1st time my phone restarted, it asked for a passcode that I did not set.  I was locked out of my phone with no way to make use of it.  It came out to be a major hassle as I eventually had to wipe it and start over.  It cost me about a day and a half of frustration working without a phone.
            "
"88","Yes Yes Yes phone in Perfect working conditions and I also upgrade it to IOS 10.1.1. It seems like what ever negative issues that was said about the phone the seller make sure and treat with these issues. I am buying another phone like this asap for my wife.
            "
"89","Came in sealed package with ¡°certified renewed by amazon¡± seal.  Charger was included.  Phone looks brand new- no scratches and had a peel off prorector on the screen.  Powered up and had a full charge and set to factory settings.  I havent installed a SIM yet but will update when i do.
            "
"90","Used and horrible battery, bought a new one and installed it, worked for a week and died..
            "
"91","I bought two iphone 5c. One works great and hasn't gave me any problems. The other ones battery was crap even though they are supposed to be tested and certified refurbished. The only option given to me when I called amazon was to get my money back but I didnt want to wait another week or two to send it back we needed the phone. I went to a phone repair store spent $40 on a battery replacement and the phone has worked great since.
            "
"92","it works fine but the battery drains SUPER fast. the phone will jump from 3% to 18% to 55%.... then it¡¯ll die. that¡¯s my only complaint.
            "
"93","Muy bonito mi hijo le agrado mucho lo unico que no venia con los audifonos
            "
"94","Bought this in Dec and after a month or two, it would turn off and freeze. Now, the phone is completely dead. What a waste of money to only get 7 months of use! The apple store couldn't even bring it back to life.
            "
"95","Bought this phone for my boyfriend who broke his iPhone 7. Originally bought a refurbished one from Best Buy but the sound did not work so we returned it. Decided to try one from Amazon after and we were not disappointed! The phone looks and runs as if it were brand new. Not even one scratch or scuff anywhere on the phone. We are very pleased with this purchase, especially for the price.
            "
"96","I was skeptical about buying a ""refurbished"" phone, but after reading the reviews for this particular seller I went ahead and bought.  We couldn't be more pleased--no regrets.  No problems hooking this up with AT&T, and works like it's brand new.
            "
"97","I take refurbished to mean defect-free. The battery drains much more quickly than my iPhone 4S I've had for 4 years. I'm guessing this phone was heavily used and/or the battery has issues. The lightning to usb cable is also defective. When I connect it to a computer, it warns that it is not a genuine product. I probably wouldn't buy another refurbished product or a product from this seller again. I will probably have to replace this phone soon and I think I will just have to go with something new.
            "
"98","I bought this for my mother for her birthday and it lasted 5 months before the phone completely died.  She took excellent care of it and she was so sad when one day it just stopped working and she lost everything on it.  Smart Tech Certified wouldn't stand behind their product so if you buy from them don't expect your phone to last more than a few months.
            "
"99","I ordered this phone because my iphone 4 was dying. I was expecting it to be with at&t like it says (which is why i bought it)  but when it came in, but it ended up being a verizon phone. This basically means I couldn't use it. So after calling the number a man said they can't do anything. Very disappointed in this purchase.
            "
"100","I was really unhappy with my purchase bought the phone on December 10,2019 three months later the phone dies and I never had service to it and the seller will not send a replacement. It wasn't anything I done just stopped turning on . All it was used for was playing games. I was really disappointed.
            "
"101","I was really confused on if I wanted to purchase this refurbished iPhone since all the bad reviews..but I can say this iPhone 5c looks brand new no marks are nothing..sadly it only comes with and off brand charger which charge my phone up just fine and no headphone..but overall I love it!!!!will order again
            "
"102","As expected. Phone was in great shape, does not come with normal accessories such as headphones and charge.
            "
"103","This phone has been irritating me a lot. When I first got it, it was working fine. Now when I go on an app it takes me right out of it, pauses my music on its own, won't send messages whether it's text or iMessage, I receive messages later than I'm supposed to, it restarts on its own constantly, and more annoying things. I seriously can't wait for the 7 to come out so I can get rid of this stupid phone.
            "
"104","Wasn¡¯t 2 day shipping as advertised but phone was great

"106","worked great but only upradge to like ios 10.4
            "
"107","We bought this because my wife's iPhone battery was not lasting very long.  This one was even worse.The phone worked fine and there were no issues with it.  We would have kept it if the battery lasted longer....
            "
"108","I actually expected some 'quirks' being refurbished but I am thrilled with this purchase.
            "
"109","Great..... Its an even brighter yellow than I expected but it was a very nice surprise!!!
            "
"110","Item looks like it's new and works like a brand new phone. Charger does not seem to be original apple item, but works perfectly fine. Item arrived in cardboard box and also contained headphones. Would highly recommend to others looking for an unlocked phone to use while traveling abroad or without a contract in the US.
            "
"111","When we got this phone it worked great. However, after only 7 months of use it will no longer charge and is therefore useless!  And its outer cover began to pop apart.  Given it is a 5C, it is not worth putting more money into, but I certainly expected it to last longer than 7 months. Very disappointing!!
            "
"112","Took just over a week to receive in mail is the only bad thing I have to say. It's just like new. I've had the phone for a few weeks and haven't had any issues what so ever. Very happy with my purchase
            "
"113","The phone was locked and when you tried to connect to iTunes it requires icloud ID and when you contact the seller to send you the orignal sales receipt for apple to verify the ownership. The seller does not provide you with one, so the phone becomes a trash.You will not be able to use the phone once its locked.
            "
"114","iPhone arrived promptly but does not work. Does not power on. Does not power on after charging for 24 hours. Does not power on after charging with a different charger or in a different outlet. Does not show up in iTunes. Sent back for full refund. AT&T has a deal for a brand new $199.99 iPhone SE. Go new.
            "
"115","Absolutely waste of my time, energy and money! I purchased this phone because it claimed to be GSM unlocked, I purchased this phone for it to be used in Brazil. After many and many hours on the phone with Apple and every single carrier trying to figure out what was wrong and restoring the phone several times, I was finally informed by Apple that this phone is NOT GSM unlocked.This phone will only work with AT&T and T-Mobile. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU PLAN ON USING IT INTERNATIONALLY OR WITH ANY OTHER DOMESTIC CARRIER!
            "
"116","Phone itself is great however there is some scratch on the back of the phone. I tried to ignore it but every time I see it..somehow it bothers me
            "
"117","When I ordered this phone I thought it¡¯s was going to be in bad condition. Well when the phone arrived it was in good condition and it turned on also is not bad of a phone

"118","Was unlocked as advertised. works fine!
            "
"119","Said it has 16 gb.  That's a lie. It only has 11 . I'm using 4 already and got 7 GBS left.  IT also GLITCHS and I've bately used it. But I guess that's a used iPhone for you. I don't recommend.  Save your money.
            "
"120","Nice durable phone
            "
"121","The screen is malfunctioning after 5 months. It either goes crazy and presses things by itself or only the right side of the screen works. Useless as i can¡¯t press anything. Did not last long. Very disappointed.
            "
"122","Very pleased with this phone so far.  It got here right away, which was awesome because my son was without a phone.  Price was right as a new phone elsewhere was hundreds more.  Happy customer.
            "
"123","Phone works but exhibits date and time issues.  Known problem with Iphone 5C.  Thought is would be corrected in the refurbishment process.
            "
"124","Works liked new. Very good for a kid that breaks things easily. Inexpensive
            "
"125","Phone works, but there IS one bug--the shutter sound on the camera never turns off. Doesn't matter if the sound is off and all settings are for the shutter sound to turn off, doesn't matter if headphones are plugged in, etc. This is not user error. I suspect that the phone was manufactured in Japan, where it is illegal to turn off the shutter sound. Now, every photo that I take is very obvious and not private at all. Other than that, the phone works well.
            "
"126","it was great for about a month then after out of nowhere it just shut off and i went to apple to see what was wrong with it but they said they didn't know , it just heats top but doesn't do anything i don't think its worth it because i i take very good care of my things

"127","Looks like a brand new phone!!

"132","The screen is damageHave water mark under it .. shame I have to return it.
            "
"133","Had phone less than 60!days before the battery quit working. Should show as fully charged then drop to 5%, shut off completely. And upon restart would show at 40%. Not worth 150 paid!!! Not happy.
            "
"134","Items was as described, so far no problems. Battery life was was good, screen and casing in good condition., no scratches or dents. Came with generic charger which seemed to work fine with the phone. Good price, would buy from thos seller again.
            "
"135","Crap! Returning. Back flash light doesn't work at all will not record video. Constantly powers itself off and on. Battery must be plugged in all the time for phone to be used. Has about 30-45 minutes of standby time and phone dies. Phone has had obvious water damage. A huge let down. If your going to buy refurbished buy from Apple or other reputable dealer. This is a huge cash trap.
            "
"136","It's a great phone for a great price.

They were out of stalk when i first ordered  And it took about a week for them to restalk.  Only took about 2 days to arrive.  I checked the mail and not 20mins later i went and got the phone turned on.  This is a must by if you're looking for a good phone
            "

"143","I love this phone but I returned it bc I did realized it has only 8gb
            "
"144","Phone came unlocked (or so I thought), so we went out to the AT&T store and got a new SIM card. We thought it was perfect until we realized there was no data. AT&T claims that, because it was originally a Sprint phone, we have to contact Sprint to unlock the data. Say what now? Contact Sprint...don't have an account? Sorry can't help ya..awesome. So now we have an iPhone 5C that can't send or receive MMS messages. Bullocks.
            "
"145","I don't know what is this about the 5C iPhone, but I love it! Finding one on Amazon for a fraction of the price really took the sting off the broken phone that I had before!
            "
"146","The phone stopped working after 2 months. There is no water damage and it was never dropped. It gives me the 'battery dead' image every time I try to turn it on even after having it on the charger

"152","Had a bad battery the second I started using it. Won¡¯t stay on, won¡¯t hold a charge and shuts off saying it¡¯s dead when the battery is charged. Typical issue with these older iPhones, thought they would have replaced the battery with refurbishment.

            "
"157","Great buy. It came a few days before it was due to arrive. Works great. The only problem was the sims card tray it had a crack in it and I had to buy a new one. Not a big deal. Exactly what I expected and a great refurbished phone.

            "
"164","Just as described
            "
"165","If I could give this a zero I would. The phone had water damage, couldn't hear anyone,  sometimes it wouldn't even let me call anyone. The wifi button was just gray, meaning I couldn't turn it on, like someone had tried to hack the phone before hand.  It was absolutely AWFUL.  Do NOT buy from them
            "
"166","Love it!! So glad I purchased this one. I did have a little trouble reading the label for the imei number, but once I got that straightened out, it's been great!!
            "
"167","Okay so I don't mean to be that ""one"" person to write a negative review, but do not buy this phone. I got fooled by the cheaper price, but it soon showed me that you get what you pay for. The day I got it set up and got my plan, the phone starting turning off completely without me doing it and I didn't think much of it. Then it started restarting by itself and when I plugged it into the charger it would get over heated. Then the next day (my second day having it) it would shut off for long periods of time and it hasn't turned on in a few days and I am planning on returning it.
            "
"168","The Phone arrived on-time along with a lightning charger cable and the infamously impossible-to-fit-in-ear Apple earbuds. From out of the box the phone had charging issues and the battery died from its current charge unbelievably quick. Besides the battery and charging issues, the short-lived time I had with the phone while it was on, the phone was responsive and worked as intended. The phone would detect that a charger was plugged in, however it was not charging and the battery was draining while it was plugged in just as fast as if it were unplugged. I attempted charging from multiple outlets, from my computer (the phone synchronized data with my computer flawlessly but was still not getting a charge), with another charger cable and I even factory reset the phone but to no avail, the battery arrived defective.I have just returned the phone and I would not recommend purchasing.

"173","Looks like new works like new my son loves this phone
            "
"174","Item came in as described. No scatches or dents
            "
"175","It functions well enough. The exterior is not the best, when they say scratched they really mean that there are a few deep cuts on the plastic cover. The screen has a few nondescript scratches. The thing that I really disliked was that the charger has a mind of its own and only works when it is plugged in with a curtain side facing up.
            "
"176","It works exactly as intended, and is in very, very good shape.  Even the battery life is pretty good.  Especially for a referb...  My only complaint is that the screen is not very responsive to the touch.  Considering I've never used this model of iPhone, I do not know if that's normal.  But it completely ignores some screen touches.  You have to hit it just right...
            "
"177","This phone was great...at first. My 90 day Apple warranty expired this month. And of course, phone completely stopped working.
            "
"178","I'm disappointed with this purchase. I paid over $200 in November. I've had the phone for 3 months and the charging port does not work any longer. I can't get the phone to charge. I would love for the company to swap our defective product out for a useable phone.
            "
"179","This phone was trouble for me since the start. The battery life on the phone is extremely poor and it acts like an older iphone would where the phone dies within the hour after being fully charged. On top of the terrible battery life, the phone glitches and kicks me out of apps constantly. It also uninstalls apps from my phone without me doing it manually and leaves the apps as if they're currently being downloaded instead of already being there. Another problem I have is that my phone is always telling me I need to put in my voicemail password when I don't have a password. I've taken it to my provider to see what they can do and they've said they're not sure why my phone even does it. Lastly, my phone constantly freezes while I'm using apps and then it shuts down and won't turn on for a while. Overall, this phone is a complete nightmare. I was traveling when I bought the phone so I couldn't return it so I guess I'm just stuck with it. Hopefully, this is just an abnormal case with these refurbished phones but I am thoroughly disappointed.

"180","You can tell it¡¯s been used. The SIM card slot is very rusty. Also doesn¡¯t come with SIM card. Doesn¡¯t have the latest update so some apps you can¡¯t download.
            "
"181","Was exactly what I needed... Works great!
            "
"182","Arrived quickly and is in perfect working order. This was a great purchase. Really good for younger kids who do no need a $1000 phone but want one that can do almost all the same things.
            "
"183","I got this phone for my grand daughter,she absolutely loved it! But it has a big scratch on screen,unfortunately she would not part with it so I could return it,so we are keeping it. I am a little disappointed ,but she insists that when the phone is on the screensaver covers it all up!!! She is something else!<U+0001F601>
            "
"184","I know it is not the latest and greatest but it works great for me. Liked it so well I bought my wife one too.  We had samsung phones but like the face time capabilities and the good quality photos of these phones
            "
"185","It is working great! Fast & free shipping! Needed a replacement phone quickly & this one was perfect for my needs, thanks!
            "
"186","The phone does NOT make or receive calls. We need to return the phone. It is not and never was UNLOCKED as the indicated.
            "
"187","Very happy with my purchase for one of my teens. Way better then financing a new phone
            "
"188","Fast and reliable I got this so I can run Pokemon go better because it constantly crashes and freezes on the iPhone 4s, I haven't had a problem yet.
            "
"189","Wouldn't keep Charge!!!!!
            "
"190","Do not waste your money it is not worth it
            "
"191","Speaker phone nor voice texting worked and hasntworked since getting it
            "
"192","The phone screen went black a couple days after the return window was closed and never came back on. It's not even worth one star.
            "
"193","Works perfectly!  Gave as a gift and my Mom loves it!!  Shipping was fast too!
            "
"194","This phone was purchased for my daughter. We have had it for over a month now and have no complaints. It looked brand new when we received it. I was worried about buying it online but I am very happy with my purchase at this point. It was definitely better than paying for a new model phone.
            "
"195","Order one for my daughter. Didn¡¯t even passed the first screen (screen wasn¡¯t working). It was a fake iPhone/not real one (I know iPhones). Felt like a scam? Very disappointed/will be sending it back tomorrow..
            "
"196","My daughter has been begging for an iPhone 5 for years. This year for her sweet 16, she got one. The phone was indistinguishable from a new phone and is in perfect working order.
            "
"197","This was advertised as refurbished with scratches and dents but it looks brand new. A great value for someone who is not wanting to shell out for a new IPhone 6.
            "
"198","Perfect phone !! Im buying a second 1 for my mother !
            "
"199","When I receive my phone it could be on 30% and it will die once I put it on charger it will turn back on right away and battery will be back on 30%  and the phone also jump to different apps then what I pressed and it seem like the phone been hacked or something and someone else controlling it.
            "
"200","The Apple iphone 5c I purchased is in an excellent condition it is clean and looks brand new, However after using the phone  for fifteen minutes each time I have to be charging it.  I find this very inconvenient
            "
"201","This is the worst phone we have ever bought. 6 months in and it won't charge right and the back is coming unglued. BUYER BEWARE!
            "
"202","The screen stopped working about 6 months after purchasing. Our local repair shop said that it looked like there had been significant water damage even though it had never gotten wet.
            "
"203","After ordering this phone back in November of 2016... Its been working just fine. I was very scared to order the phone because I seen many comments saying how it starts messing up after 4 months and all other types of problems. From my experience having the phone for now 5 months it works just as I expected it to and I love it.
            "
"204","I bought this for my wife and she loves it. The phone looked as good as brand new and it works fine. I would buy one again.
            "
"205","The phone keeps switching off randomly, gets stuck on the apple start-up screen, I've restored it a couple times which makes it work for a day or so and then it continues to give me the same problems. I was going to return it but thought I'd give it a shot as a phone to have in between phones. But it's really not worth the $150.00 and I don't think this machine should have been sold as certified refurbished because it barely works.
            "
"206","I received the product quickly and it had no damages and cracks. It looked completely brand new and the phone worked really well! Thank you!
            "
"207","its good phone but it only last with me one week and then I had issues with it
            "
"208","the worse thing in the word, i bought 2 of these stuff, but came defective, trouble with the battery, wifi issues, software trouble, you may think if amazon fulfill, they may have a good quality control. Sad phone.
            "
"209","Great price for this great little phone!
            "
"210","Very disappointed this iphone only lasted just past its warranty of 90 days.
            "
"211","This was supposed to be refurbished but appears that no work was ever done on it! Holding out hoping it would repair itself, LOL, but finally returned it. Touch screen didn't work and microphone rarely functioned.
            "
"212","Just received this phone yesterday and it took me seconds to hook up. It works great and my daughter loves it. I was a little Leary buying a refurbished phone, but it really looks brand new. Thanks for such a great product at a decent priceMelissa
            "
"213","so far so good. The buttons don't seem to be super responsive, but that may just be me not used to an iphone.
            "
"214","My daughter purchased this phone for her birthday and we had one issue about 90 days later where it would only work on speaker phone or via the headphones.  After a $50 repair we were back to good (from an Apple Authorized Service Provider).  Seems to be having problems with certain apps now as well.
            "
"215","I've had problems with it since I've gotten it.  Just spend the money on a new phone b/c at this point I've wasted so much time and effort on trying refurbished phones out.
            "
"216","refurbished phone. has some weird things go on with it. freezes up. guess you get what you pay for
            "
"217","Advertised as a refurbished unlocked GSM iPhone 5c that works on AT&T. Came to us as a LOCKED Verizon phone. Neither AT&T nor Verizon could do anything with it. Also if refurbished means an inconsistency lit screen, then yes, this was refurbished.
            "
"218","I bought this phone for my husband and he really loves it<U+0001F604> it was packaged well and was exactly what I was expecting.
            "
"219","Phone looks good but it is not functioning correctly. While battery recharge it is over heating very hard to touch also in phone charging. I gifted this to my mother and it is not working in india.
            "
"220","Got here on time, exactly as described. Looks brand new, works like brand new. Wouldn't know it was a refurb. Came with charger/cable. Really happy with seller and purchase.
            "
"221","Looks new!! Works fine.
            "
"222","The item is in very good condition. It did not see any scratches on the phone.However, the package includes non-original lightning cable and adapter. It is missing any earphones as advertise in the images.
            "
"223","Bought unlocked phone, After using few months - the phone locked again , when asked they are saying -- warranty expired -- better luck with you phone.
            "
"224","Bought it for my mom, she loves it. Very fast
            "
"225","After the first few weeks, the phone needs to be recharged every day - clearly the battery has been run down significantly and if one were to replace it now, it would have been more cost effective to buy a new phone in the first place.
            "
"226","I looked through comments before I purchased to confirm if I need a SIM card or not to utilize the iPhone without actual phone service, and just connect it to wifi for apps. Most comments said a SIM card was NOT needed to use the phone. That is accurate, HOWEVER, I did need a SIM card to ACTIVATE the phone. I tried three different ""workarounds"" that I found online, and none of them worked to allow me to activate the phone. Thankfully my current iPhone utilizes the same SIM card so I was able to insert it and activate it, then remove it and now it works fine but wanted to mention this encase anyone else is trying to research before they buy too.
            "
"227","Terrible purchase. I took this phone to a t-mobile expert and they said the phone was listed as STOLEN!!!! Do NOT buy this phone!! It works just like a regular iphone except you cant activate it. (Bc its stolen) also, i ordered pink and they sent me yellow instead. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS!!!!
            "
"228","It has very low storage and it won't last to long before it dies:(
            "
"229","<U+00A0>Worked for about a 3 weeks. Then could not shut it off and screen don¡¯t work when u touch it. It all lights up and that¡¯s it.
            "
"230","Everything about the phone works great, except when I make calls I can barly hear the other person and they can barley hear me...so there's that.
            "
"231","Minor scratches on the back, but overall in great shape especially for the price.  The phone has been working great for 2 weeks with now complains.
            "
"232","So far it works very well.  If it holds up a solid 2 years, I'll be impressed.  Otherwise, I'll be back for an update.
            "
"233","I found screen out of control after 3 months I bought this phone. If I scroll down the page, screen will jump to somewhere. sometimes  I even afraid to using pay bill via this phone, since the number will come out missed up. I should return this phone after I found out this problem. I know it's too late to complain this problem.
            "
"234","Constantly dropping calls. Constantly breaking up when talking.
            "

            "
"238","Very nice iphone, just like a brand new iphone. No scratches, nothing. Although they do not include the original iphone charger, which was kind of a bummer but the iphone it self it really good.
            "
"239","At first this was absolutely great,but 2 or 3 weeks after,it wasn't working it was doing things by it's self and I was disappointed <U+0001F61E>
            "
"240","when i first got the phone it was fine looked and worked like it was brand new. a few weeks after i got it the time stopped working, wifi does not, nor does imessage, i restored the phone 50x and i even took it to the apple store they said it was nothing they could do i now have to buy a whole new phone.
            "
"241","works well for a few months then starts glitching
            "
"242","I am very happy with this phone. It seems like it is a new phone. No scratches or dents. T-Mobile had no problem setting it up. If I have any future problems, I'll post again.

"249","The battery had to be replaced. But everything else is great. It only had a few minor scratches which was expected. Over all I am very happy with the purchase!
            "
"250","Very impressed how quickly it came in, but disappointed on the scuff marks and bit of raised plastic from a visible drop. But satisfied and ready to see how it goes.
            "
"251","The phone is great. Works perfectly.
            "
"252","Product looks were appropriate however the phone was unable to make or receive phone calls. When able to connect (rarely) there was a knocking sound on the phone. Was leery of buying a refurbished item and was really disappointed that the item did not work properly.
            "
"253","I recommend them 100% excellent
            "
"254","Worked good.
            "
"255","The phone was great at first, but two weeks later I started having issues with it. The location services don't work and the date and time are always wrong even if I set it manually. I am fed up with it and will be sending it back.
            "
"256","Im sorry but I feel so angry now, the Iphone never worked, It does not turn on. I need return this item... The phone was going to be a gift for my boyfriend, I feel disappointed.
            "
"257","My niece loved it. The packaging had a couple hardly noticeable cosmetic issues. But the phone and included Apple headphones were great.
            "
"258","turned the phone on, saw a pinkish oval tint in the center of the screen and put right back in the box to return.
            "
"259","Question for the seller.My phone stop working, I bought it on June 23.For some reason it doesn't work anymore.Is there some kind of warranty?Thanks in advance.
            "
"260","Excellent condition
            "
"261","Not worth the hassle
            "
"262","It ain't turning on and it say Verizon on the back I thought it was at&t very disappointed can't see how all these good reviews are here when mine isnt even turning on must be fake reviews cause nobody would be this happy to pay that much for a phone that doesn't work and it didn't even come with headphones  second most dissapointing part
            "
"263","Purchased phone on June 16 and it gave me problems all long having it for a total of 4 months.  It finally shut down and never came back on.  Will never purchase a refurbished phone from this merchant.

            "
"266","Great buy. The phone was in good condition with no scratches or cracks. Took it to the AT&T store and set it up with no problems. Only complaint is that there's some lint in the ear piece and the battery life could be better. Other than that, I love itUpdate April 2018: Still working!
            "
"267","The phone worked good for 2 weeks and then wouldn¡¯t get service anywhere. Tried 3 SIM cards and realized the phone was the problem. Went to Walmart and bought a brand new iPhone 6 for $200.

            "
"292","Phone arrived in good condition, and two months later I've still had no problems with it. No complaints about the seller. The chord that was included was only for USB. I had to buy a wall-charging brick separately.
            "
"293","Phone has been perfectly fine so far. Got it for my son and put on Cricket plan. I did have to throw away the cord that's the reason for 4 stars. When I plugged in the cord it came with it immediately got super hot to the touch and went straight in the trash.
            "
"294","I'm a senior and it serves me well.

            "
"303","Laggy response to touch and terrible battery life. Not to mention it freezes up constantly! Terrible product and I am completely unsatisfied with this phone.
            "
"304","This product was not as advertised. It was locked by a private carrier and could not be unlocked for use by my current carrier or by Apple. Do not waste your time or money.
            "
"305","As expected!~
            "

            "
"310","Phone arrived looking and feeling like it'd been taken apart, screen was glitchy, and at times unresponsive. Buying another one becuase I'm pretty sure that was just a fluke, will update review when I receive second one
            "
"311","Phone is in great shape. Like new. Only issue is the charging cable does not charge the phone.
            "
"312","This phone is a piece of poop I was so excited but when I turned it on it did not work HORRIBLE.
            "
"313","I got this phone in November as a Christmas present. Was soon as she started using her phone she had problems. It wouldn't charge it started turning off when it was on. Its would stay charged when ever it did charge. I'm so disappointed!!!
            "
"314","Happy to have this phone!
            "
"315","Phone worked fine. Battery issues. Also, was dented on back and dirty

            "
"317","Thank you so much for delivering it to me but the product was not charging and it arrived battery empty. I tried it with different charger but it still wouldn't charge. Please change this phone, i beg you. I am a student and I badly need a phone for our school work as soon as possible. Thank you so much guys.
            "
"318","the package contained  the phone and charger. It was in great condition and the battery still works very well
            "
"319","Came on time, looks brand new, in the box was the iPhone, a case, tool for the sim, and a third party durable charger
            "
"320","So bad, I just use one month and the product had a damage, charging very slowly and then the phone burned.
            "
"321","Phone was not unlocked, tried two different SIM cards from Verizon and the phone would not make any calls.
            "
"322","phone arrived looking brand new. works perfectly fine.
            "
"323","It was clearly not inspected before sending and did not look like a refurbished product at all. I have used (and still using a refurbished iphone/ipad) and therefore have fair knowledge of the concept of refurbishment. The phone I received was in really bad condition, with patch of stains on the screen, body, the ringer button, with patch of dust in the headphone jack, charging port, etc. The extent of scratches were beyond describable. The screen was also not entirely intact, and made click sounds during usage.Returned.
            "
"324","I was looking for an unlocked iPhone to use on MetroPCS. THIS IS PERFECT. The SIM card is nano, and my previous phone used mini, but cutting the SIM card worked. I looked at other options and it was about $40 cheaper on Groupon. The deciding factor was the 90 day warranty and free prime shipping - which Groupon does not offer. Phone performs perfectly. The only thing I am not a fan of is that you cannot silent the shutter sound on the camera. I think it's because the phone is a Japanese version. And although that doesn't effect anything else on the phone, the shutter sound is a little annoying and I feel it slows down taking a photo. All in all, 100% worth it.
            "
"325","This iphone did not work well at all. it was very slow and took forever to load simple things, even my old iphone 4 was much faster. Also, one time it randomly froze up for hours and no matter what I did it stayed on the same screen. At least I returned it and got a refund
            "
"326","This Phone Is Amazing!! It Worth The Money! and It¡¯s Just Perfect
            "
"327","The phone arrived in great condition, but I still had issues when I went to AT&T to get it working.  The charger it came with broke within 2 days of use.
            "
"328","Fully charged battery lasts about 45 minutes. Phone is completely useless with such a battery life.
            "
"329","the battery is not taking any charge, if you  can replace my battery that will be very nice.
            "
"330","Gift for a family member. They love it!
            "
"331","This phone is a safety hazard. After 3 months of me owning this phone I started not staying charged and randomly shutting off. One morning I found the phone on my dresser like the pictures show the battery had expanded and at this point is now leaking. This could be very dangerous.
            "
"332","(White)I like the phone it looks great and everything but seems like something is wrong with the charge port I can't touch it whatsoever when it's on charge I just recieved it today I WANT MY MONEY BACK MY GF GOT HER PHONE TODAY N IT WORKS PERFECT

"333","My daughter loves it.. the only issue is the battery drains pretty quickly. But other thrn that its perfect.
            "
"334","Arrived in a timely fashion.  Works great.
            "
"335","Appears as good as new. No blemishes at all. I'm surprised how nice it is. Seems to function perfectly and battery life is good so far.  It came with a sticker on it that said Verizon, even though the product description explicitly said GSM (ATT and T-Mobile).  Fortunately it worked with T-Mobile SIM with no problem.  Apparently the label was either wrong or misleading.  The price has gone up $30 since I bought it.  If I could have known for sure that it would be as nice as it really is, I would have spent those extra $30, but since buying ""refurbished"" is something of a crapshoot, I probably would not have considered it at this new price, sight unseen.  [Tricky grammar in that last sentence.]Few weeks later: Still going strong.  No problems whatsoever.  Battery life is as good as new too.

"382","Had a lot of problems with it.  Mainly SIM card didn't work
            "
"383","The phone came with minor imperfections on the body, which was as expected. Everything works fine and it is a very nice phone. Worth the money.EDIT: This phone was bought as a gift for my younger brother and has since been returned. My grandma and I purchased a SIM Card for the phone, but the phone was unable to get service! The bar at the top of the phone would constantly be ""Searching for Singal"" but was never able to find one. We tested the SIM Card using one of our phones, and it worked fine, so the problem must have lied within the phone itself. Really terrible because my brother loved the phone but we simply couldn't get it to work properly. ):
            "
"384","The phone was great, no problems, looks new no scratches, came with original usb cord, and a simple wall mount charger, no head phones, phone works great, althought i havent activated soneill see how it goes
            "

"388","I ordered a yellow 32gb. It came with not a single scratch. The only problem was the charger. It stopped working correctly after 3 days. I had to go to Walmart to buy another one. Besides that the phone is excellent. It didn't come with headphones but I can't complain because it's refurbished.
            "

            "
"393","WHEN I purchased the iPhone there is something inside the headphone jack!
            "
"394","I took phone to India for one month while traveling.The call quality was very bad there, other side use to hear choppy sound with missing words in call with iPhone. Other phones worked fine over same network.
            "
"395","I also ordered a blue iPhone from this same company and although it's an icloud phone it has limited storage and is nothing like the green one as it pertains to storage. It cuts off and erases photos and other apps for no reason. I wish I would have done research on the company before buying from there. I've had this product for less than two months, something that should last for years, and it's garbage. The company told me to take it up with amazon, but we're past the warranty window. So if you want to spend $150 for an iPhone that will last only a month and a half after purchase this is the company to go to. RUN!! FIND A BETTER COMPANY TO DO BUSINESS WITH, SOMEONE WHO CARES ABOUT THE CUSTOMER AND NOT THE MONEY
            "
"396","Spend the extra money and get 16 or 32 gb of memory.  8 gb is not enough.
            "

"525","dead and dead... an absolute 0 stars but thats not an option. Opened it looked nice and new not a scratch... didn't turn on so i plugged it in to its charger and cord... dead battery <U+0001F50B>ok so i left it to charge for an hour.. came back to check it and no change... still dead <U+0001F50B>symbol... and smell of burning copper wire but it wasnt hot to the touch. when i looked at some more reviews i noticed farther down the many that this was apparently an ongoing issue. I got the phone at 3 it is now 6pm.. i still kept it on the charger the whole time BUT NOW not even a dead battery symbol... nothing... black...dead... and going back tomorrow. i'd much rather fork over the funds for a new one than try and cut corners next time... i have to say this Amazon has been really disappointing me lately... smh

"576","I got this phone knowing it would have some damage, but the screen was NOT secured in the phone so it often popped up and you could see the light under the screen. I called support and they credited me $30 for their error. That's great and all til I found out that the ear phone jack plug doesn't work for headphones..... Like at all. wish I had known then, I'd have returned the whole phone instead of taking the credit. Internally tho, the phone has worked great. Gonna keep it until the 7 comes out

"593","description from product page states...This Certified Refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new, with limited to no wear. The refurbishing process includes functionality testing, inspection, and repackaging.The 1st thing I notice is the cracked screen, then I attempted to turn on the phone.  The refurbishing process needs a quality check because this should have failed it.  I wasted two days, better off spending more money on a NEW phone.
            "
"594","Was more than I expected, works great, also a good Value compare to stores! I never bought refurbished before, so far so good!
            "
"595","Yeah the phone has only been in my hands for a couple of days and it has been amazing. The only drawback is not based on the seller but on Apple on general since the OS takes a lot more storage than I thought it would. This is an amazing deal if what you want is a close to new IPhone on the cheap. It comes with everything but the earphones and I connected it with T-Mobile perfectly. I will make a new review as days go by.
            "

"602","This is the second iPhone 5C that I've purchased.  My first one failed after going through a complete wash and dry cycle in my pocket.  Wonder why that happened?  In any case, this replacement has been working fine as a replacement.  It's working on my original SIM card that came out of the water logged and then roasted iPhone.  It came packaged well with a new (aftermarket non-Apple) charger and cable.  The phone looks new although it is a refurbished unit.All in all, I'm quite satisfied (5 star) and wouldn't hesitate to buy again from Dealfisher (through Amazon).

            "
"616","great
            "
"617","The most disappointing consumer experience I can remember. I bought 2 of these phones based on Amazon's refurbished phone assurances and warranty. One showed up with a big gash on the screen and scuffing all over and was returned immediately. The other looked great, we got it all set up, and it died after ONE day. Completely dead.  I hope I will get Amazon's usual high level of customer service, but what a waste of time and effort this turned out to be.

"625","I recently destroyed my old iPhone 5C after I blew out the battery with a cheap charger so I had to purchase a new one. This phone is definitely one of the better priced iPhones on here and it works like it's brand new! I've had it for a few months now and I haven't had any issues with it so far. It comes with a charger and wall plug (mine came already charged though). It IS unlocked and I haven't had any problems with any of my sim cards. So for those of you who don't have any of the regular big company cellphone plans; this should work for you with no issue. This is definitely one of the better purchases I've spent my money on.
            "
"626","Practical , cheaper
            "
"627","When I received this phone everything was fine... Until a few weeks later, the phone began to act up internally, my phone will randomly spark up into colored bars then start to dim. I can not touch it, turn it on. Nothing. But when I hold the top right corner the phone works perfectly normal till I let the top go. Then it gets colored bars and dim again. This is extremely frustrating! And so disappointing.  PLUS! I can not hear anything out of my phone without headphones. I can't hear my alarm go off. Music. I can't even hear my keyboard click! This is an extreme disappointment. I'm never ordering from here again until something is done about this.

"714","I received this phone dead, and since then it had been troubles. For starters, the phone did not charge correctly. I bought numerous chargers from Best Buy, and nothing worked. It either wouldn't charge at all, or it charged very slowly. It also just restarted out of nowhere whenever it felt like it. I could be in the middle of the a text and it would just restart. I'm not sure if I was just given a bad phone, or this company is really bad. Hope this helps someone!

The actual packaging was almost identical to Apple and it came with genuine Apple charging brick and cable. Checked the IMEI an all works great. I will update if anything happens down the road.

"750","Less than a year, the battery stopped working and has swelled up. I'm not sure if this was due to the iOS update that killed a ton of iPhone batteries this year or if the battery was just bad, but the phone is junked. Never buying another Apple product.

"778","I ordered this phone as a gift for my sister. After patiently waiting for it, it arrived and she eagerly began to set it up. Upon trying to set it up we found out it was locked - when the item description clearly stated it was unlocked. So we tried calling apple who then forwarded us onto this us fire carrier who this phone was through in an attempt to get it unlocked. They then stated that they couldn't do anything unless they got permission from whoever owned it previously, which was basically telling me I had a dud phone because I bought it from the internet.Immediately packed it up, dropped it off at the ups store and went to Walmart and bought my sister the iPhone SE, she had it the same day and couldn't have been happier.
            "
"779","Its a really good phone and no flaws
            "

            "
"784","This was my first time getting an iPhone, not to mention a refurbished phone,so I was a little worried but I really love this phone,it's about my third day of having it and so far so good,only problem I have is I wish they would package the phone better then just stuffing it in a back and calling it a day.
            "
"785","Good!
            "
"786","The phone looks brand new. Im very happy
            "
"787","The box that it came in looked like it had been kicked around all day, the box was not taped so the package could ame open just by holding it a certain way, there was no protective packaging inside of the box which CAUSED THE CASE TO BREAK!! There was no invoice or receipt included in the box. I got the phone and it would not charge correctly. I would charge it for a couple hours and when I unplug the phone sometimes it completely dies and I must start charging from 1% again. The battery drains quickly. I would not recommend this phone to anyone...
            "

"801","Everything was as promised.  Good condition.
            "
"802","The phone was perfect
            "
"803","Three stars because, while the phone works very well, has an awesome amount of storage, works perfectly with my SIM card service, and overall works smoothly, there's one pretty big problem: the charging port does not always work. I know it's the phone and not the cord, because I've tested cords with other phones, and they work perfectly fine. The phone has to be set down and not moved, or it might stop charging, and it often takes several tries to get it to start charging. Also, the headphone jack stopped working a month after I got it, so now I have to go buy Bluetooth earbuds. Both problems started about a month after I got the phone.
            "
"804","Exactly what I was looking for, in great shape (brand new)..
            "
"805","This was definitely the worse birthday gift... my wife surprised me with a new iPhone 5c which was the best part of the surprise because once I received the iPhone it lagged and kept restarting when I was in the middle of using it. The screen would work at times perfectly and at others it wouldn't. Amongst other things, the worse part was that the phone wouldn't sync to my iTunes or iPhoto on my Mac Book Pro... very big let down!! I woukdbt recommend buying it as much as the price may seem right in the long run the product isn't worth it

"826","a gift - just what she wanted
            "
"827","My unit shipped promptly and was received within the estimated delivery window. In terms of exterior looks, the phone itself was all right - there were no scratches or visual blemishes. However, the unit I got shipped with a battery that would drain after 15 minutes on a call. As a result, I returned the unit and will hold off on purchasing another refurbished device.

"833","Thanks
            "
"834","this product is garbage. I paid almost $200 for it and I can't even use it unless the previous owner removes their iCloud so I can get the phone activated. I'm returning it. I emailed BREED the company who sold it to me and now they are saying this phone didn't come from them when it did because I sent the order number and they still denied it. Y'all really suck. I rather just get a iPhone 5s from cricket or boost mobile for $250 or less with the activation. It'll be worth it cause it will work ! Smh.

"837","excellent phone
            "
"838","I'm actually a little sad and very disappointed that I bought this phone. I love all of the features that apple provides but after about a week of receive the phone, the time fluctuates and never remains correct despite all of the forums filled with suggestions. I've probably set this phone about 20 times already and gave up doing so because no matter how much I do it, it eventually goes to an incorrect time. I've been late for appoints numerous times because of it and can't really use any time sensitive apps. Apparently this is a common glitch, with the 5c. This is my first IPhone and I'm a bit bummed by this. I hope no one else experiences this.
            "
"839","As promised!
            "
"840","Works very good
            "
"841","Ordered the refurbished model, expected the possibility of MINOR scratches and such as mentioned in the description...SOOOO - this is what I got (pictured) as a gift for my daughter. Cracked case around headphone jack, headphones will not work, and the crack leaves a sharp edge that I expect will end up catching on clothing and completely breaking off.COMPLETE JUNK, WASTE OF MONEY!This took over a week to ship even though it was ""in stock"", shipped next day air (arrived a day late due to whatever the holdup was), and is broken. Now I have to return it, get another, and be held up for even longer??Thanks a WHOLE LOT!!!! :-(EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED which is becoming the ""Amazon norm""...

            "
"857","This was a great phone, don't listen to anyone who says otherwise. Just make sure you keep the sticker on the back so your phone carrier company can scan it to activate it when you take it in. Great phone just needs a better iPhone charger, that way it will charge faster. Works great had it for a month now and I have no problems! Get it! I'm so not lying, I was scared myself but everything turned out great<U+263A><U+FE0F>!
            "
"858","We purchased a 5c and are disappointed with how scratched up it is.  When you buy refurbished you assume there will be some wear and tear, but this is beyond normal wear.  My son and I are disappointed.
            "
"859","This phone is amazing. Looks new! No problems activating it and it just exceeded all my expectations :) definitely worth the buy! It's pretty cheap actually
            "
"860","This phone is advertised as an unlocked GSM phone.  When it arrived it had a Verizon sticker on it and even the ATT store cannot get it to utilize LTE.  The ad for this phone says it ATT and TMobile but it is not working.It' works fine on 4g but I didn't buy it for the slower network.
            "
"861","This phone is in tip-top shape and works like new. If I didn't know any better I'd guess it was a new phone. As advertised, it is compatible with AT&T and has been working smoothly since I set it up. I wished it would have come with an apple charger because those tend to be more reliable, but if the provided charger doesn't perform well then I can easily buy one from the apple store. Very happy with this!
            "
"862","My daughter was very happy with her phone. We discover the charger was bad it failed to charge her phone. We had another iphone exactly like it but white she plugged her cord in it and it works perfectly. We got her another wall charger and she is a happy camper. We also found a solar charger so when she is at the lake she can keep it charged.
            "
"863","Great iPhone came brand new and I love the green color!
            "
"864","The price was right and I'm really thankful it was so easy to get a phone for this price and convenience, but the battery is horrible and for some reason after I did the update my text messages erase automatically several times a day, which is very frustrating. Overall, it's a good deal for a used iphone.
            "
"865","Works just like an iphone should.After 4 months use, the touchscreen has little sensitivity, especially in the corners where it does not work at all.It sometimes will not receive a charge and often drains to 1% when plugged in.
            "
"866","This phone will not work with AT&T service.  I am going to send it back.
            "
"867","I love the phone and it works great, except when I'm using the phone the screen pops on and off so I can't use the speakerphone and I also can't end my phone call unless I push the power button. It's still usable just more of an annoyance
            "
"868","Best phone I've had yet. Easy to use and great functionality.
            "
"869","It works great!!! It is in perfect condition and looks like new.. Im really happy. I would just say that the home button doesn t work prefect, it s a bit slow.. But anyway it s fine! I m sattisfied.
            "
"870","I don't know if it was because it wasn't A brand new phone and refurbished?? But it was garbage.  It worked fine until after one week the touch screen quit working!! Just like that!!I took the phone into a metro store and they said it was the sensor inside the iPhone... and return it to where ever I purchased it. So I did and finally was issued a full refund by Amazon.
            "
"871","Phone came in perfect condition. Loved it.

            "
"874","the phones screen is out of place or loose or something.You can press to text and hear it clicking I'm and out the phone and also feel it too.You can tell it's been dropped before and that's what was more than likely replaced on it.Returning it before I end up dropping it and God forbid drop it and it breaks because it was loose to begin with.Thanks.
            "
"875","I was so excited to receive this phone in the mail! When it came i put a sim card in it and tried to put my carrier on it, and it wouldnt let me! I guess i have a phony IMEI number so i cannot put service on it, i can only use it on wifi which bums me out but i guess thats what i get for being too excited...
            "
"876","Thank you so much for this new and good looking cell phone.It was my first iPhone and I am super exited to get it.Fast shipping and short waiting.I really recommend you to buy it.

"877","Ordered a GMS for ATT.. Arrived with a sticker that said.. carrier: Varizon..gave it to my daughter whom is a varizon customer.. I ordered another phone. Mean time Varizon could not get it to work.. it is a phone for ATT.. so dont believe the stickers..
            "
"878","Unfortunately this phone can't recognize cellular operator. I've tried anything to fix it up: reboot, upgrade ios, change sim card. Nothing helped. Amazon labeled this product as refubrished certificated but it's not. If anyone got the solution I'll be appreciate for the info.
            "
"879","phone is junk!! Glass started lifting from corners 2 days after we had it connected for my 11 year old! I would never buy from this seller again!

"884","Hello,I was expecting this phone to work with the sprint network, however, sprint informed me that I would not be able to use this phone.I'll be returning the phone. I'm sure the phone worked well, it just didn't allow me to use it via sprint.
            "
"885","i bought it and the screen stopped working after 3 weeks...
            "
"886","Very happy I switched from Sprint to T-Mobile SIM card phone. Saving $45/mo.!!! Not a scratch on my phone. Very pleased.
            "
"887","It came in great condition and looks brand new. It work perfectly fine. I read reviews that it stops working after 3 months, what do you expect for something so cheap. When it wears out I'll upgrade. Good phone for a good price.

"888","Phone's keyboard was unresponsive in several spots.

"890","I had a problem with one of the cell phones, since I had to do a reset and apparently at the time of selling it did not eliminate the amount of icloud I had, and now I can not access the phone, as I do so that the seller of the information or that eliminates the imei of the telephone of its icloud account?
            "
"891","The phone works well but it doesn't work with just any iPhone charger which sucks cause that means I have to buy original chargers from Apple. The charger they sent with the phone did not work so I ask to send a new one please.

"897","Just got this phone for my daughter.was looking for an unlocked phone for straight talk.I am very impressed with it so far.It came packaged like bran new.Perfect condition and so far works well.I have just purchased my 2nd one for myself so I hope it's as good as this one.If you are thinking about getting this one and have reservations,,don't it's a great looking phone and you can't beat the price either.
            "
"898","Works great and was easy to get working with T-Mobile
            "
"899","Phone is in very good condition and works well. At check out the option for a new one was available and was selected, but ended up with the reconditioned phone. Definitely pleased with the product.
            "
"900","Few free apps doesn't support. Like Skype. Cannot hear otherside properly and freezes the screen. So the basis functions is not performing and it's annoying when I paid and didn't get back iPhone usage.
            "
"901","After a month the display and keyboard stop working. There's lines going across the screen and after a few seconds the keyboard locks. I am not satisfied.
            "
"902","Phone would not charge

"905","Good product..
            "
"906","I received the phone when expected. That was great, but I thought it would work just as my previously owned iPhone 5c and it doesn't. The home button doesn't work all the time, the mic stops working in between calls also when trying to use Siri and the phone is dented and scratched a bit.
            "
"907","I had to return it. I'm waiting  my money back. It brought no instructions, nor headphones,  it not came in its original box. I am convinced that the iphone was not Refurbished, but was used.
            "
"908","ok
            "
"909","The phone was for my wife.  She takes a lot of pictures.  She is very happy.
            "
"910","2nd order.  Same as the first:  Paid a premium for what I thought was an organization that paid attention to their refurbishing.  Plugged it in.  Did not charge.
            "
"911","The phone was not fully wiped when i received it and now I cant make any changes.  Its is basically useless.

            "
"915","If I could give negative stars I would. The phone will not activate. I've spent hours at sprint stores. Terrible!
            "
"916","Terrible! Crashed multiple times. Just died 6 days after the return window closed (DEAD DEAD - won't charge, reboot, reset, etc). ""Certified Refurbished""? Really? Amazon/BREED -- Can you help?
            "
"917","I sent to you the sim is not working
            "
"918","Although the phone looked new, the sound did not work. Returned it for refund.

"944","I do not normally write reviews, but I had to this time to warn others.  I received this today and immediately tried it out as it is a Christmas present for my daughter.  This phone has a Verizon sticker on the back which is normal a CDSM carrier not a GSM.  The phone is also NOT Unlocked!!!  It would not work with a sim previously being used in a different iPhone 5c that was unlocked.  I am very upset as I cannot get another one in time for Christmas.  I just want to say thank you for ruining my daughter's Christmas!!!!

"958","This product showed up with the wrong charger.  Then when I plugged it in using one of our chargers it wouldn't take a charge.  My son noticed that the screen on the phone was popped up in one corner.  The phone kept turning on and off and never did take a charge.  The only positive thing was that a full refund was given.

            "
"981","I've had this phone for just over the 90 day warranty. I dropped it and the entire screen popped out.  After putting the screen back into the phone, I noticed that it was missing two little screws that should have been there to hold the screen in.  No other part of the phone broke.  I can only see about a quarter inch of the screen.  When I contacted the seller, they said there was nothing they could do because my warranty was up.  I would understand if I dropped it and the screen cracked or something, but it only came out because it was missing these screws.  It's supposed to be certified refurbished!!!!!
            "
"982","i was just glad that the phone works after i saw the ugly box that came in it and the cable & charger not original .
            "
"983","Is good
            "
"984","The battery did not hold a charge and some days i could not get it to charge at all.
            "
"985","The phone is a piece of junk. I had it for 3 or 4 weeks and it was fine. The LCD screen just randomly stopped working, and I looked some of the things up online. I believe it has a swollen battery. Do not buy this product! Amazon was good enough to take it back and refund me tho.
            "
"986","The product i snot fully tested. In middle of phone operation, the screen touch would was not functioning, resulting in phone dead like situation. Only way to get it back was to wtich off phone and on it back again. this was lot of trouble. Iam totally not satisfied with prodcut
            "
"987","The phone was not unlocked. Had to send it back. The only good thing was that my money was returned without and further hassel
            "
"988","Only worked for a month and a half, then the battery would die as the phone was on the charger. Phone can not hold a charge and is completely unusable. Only a 30 day warranty period of course, seems poorly refurbished to me.
            "
"989","so disappointed! I brought my phone from here but was pissed when instead of holding 8GB it only allows me to store 5GB of data then says unable to store more! The phone randomly surges colorful lights! I paid almost $200 for the phone and I basically wasted money because this phone is literally crap!

I gotta say I'm more than happy with my purchase. I downloaded all my icloud apps, pictures and contacts without trouble. the speakers sound good too. I strongly recommend this seller,
            "
"1012","This phone was given to me as a gift. I have always used android phones so I didn't know how I would adapt to the ""apple world,"" but let me tell ya, I loved this phone. I only say that in past tense because I had a break in and it was stolen, but I will be replacing it with this exact model. The phone is SOLID and the battery lasts so much longer than any other mobile I have ever owned. Can't wait to get my new one!K. Kris Loomis is the author of the Modern Shorts for Busy People series.

"1015","Broke after a week and the screen popped off. I just sent an email asking for an exchange for a better phone, hopefully what comes next will change my review but for now -$200+phone for a week=1 star review.

"1016","The reason I gave this rating is because this is not what I was expecting. First of all the lighting on the screen is very deem, secondly I can't access icloud and the battery life is nothing close to  four hours. There are a few good qualities about this phone, like the sound of the speakers and the picture quality but I wish I didn't buy this phone. Thake it from me just buy a 5s Don't waste your money on a 5c  like I did.

"1021","This phone has worked well for me however my phone randomly WONT turn on. This has happened before and it fixed itself but this time, not so much. I like the choice of colors and size.

            "
"1045","I needed an extra phone for work and I wanted an iPhone, but I didn't want to pay for a newer one. I purchased this iPhone 5c through DealFisher and it looks brand new. It came with a wall outlet charger and a lightning to USB cord. The phone is working great, although I haven't got a SIM card yet so I can't speak to that. I searched the IMEI online and it is unlocked and nothing seems to be fishy about it. The only downside about a phone with only 8 GB of memory means there is about 4 GB left for pictures and apps and anything else. I would recommend this for a second phone for someone, or a phone for a kid or preteen who doesn't need much space.
            "
"1046","I'm very pleased with this purchase. It really looks like new, except that there is that thought in the back of my head that keeps telling me it isn't. But the white surface is really nice. No scratches are visible anywhere. The screen works very well. I haven't used the earphones plug, but the audio on the phone's speakers sounds good for an older iPhone. The only one thing that made me rate it 4 stars is that the charger is of another brand, not apple and no earphones are included (but I wasn't expecting them). I bought this as an emergency phone because I broke my old phone and the price was reasonable for a phone that was going to be temporary, but now I think I will keep it however long it lasts. I have T-mobile service, and my old phone had the mini (the smallest ) sim card, so changing my number to this phone was very easy because it requires that same type of sim card and all you have to do after you tranfer the sim card for t-mobile is to follow the iphone's setup (at the beginning, before you do anything, it will ask you to insert the sim card). Also it arrived before expected.
            "
"1047","This is amazing! I ordered this 1 business day shipping. When I saw the phone I was like omg! Not a single scuff, scratch, marks anything. I have metro pcs so everyone who is wondering it works with metro! <U+0001F60A>
            "
"1048","I expected a little bit more from a refurbished phone. I bought this to tide me over while my 6s+ is out for data recovery due to a drop in the ocean on vacation. The issues with this replacement phone so far are: flimsy home button which isn't broken but is definitely on its way, the Battery Life app reports only 70% of original design capacity (my previous phones never got done that far after 2+ years of use), and (nitpicky) but the phone I received had several stickers on the back which required some goo gone to fully remove.On the plus side, the phone seems to operate great otherwise after all the updates were applied and my backup was restored. Apps appear to run fairly quickly considering how out of date this phone is.Something to note is that this is a 32-bit phone, and it at least looks like Apple is on the cusp of phasing these out. This means likely no more updates and a shrinking app store is in this phone's near future.So for a hold-me-over/backup phone I can't complain considering the price point, but as a primary phone I wouldn't recommend it long term.
            "
"1049","1st-star for fast delivery2nd-star for great customer service3rd-star no physical damage. No scratches, cracks, or dentsI had to deduct a star because I couldn't simply exchange my device. I would have to return it for a refund and pay again at a higher price for another phone even when my device wasn't working properly.I deduct the last star because the volume on the handset is a bit distorted. I could still hear out of it but just not as good. I bought wired earbuds for my cell phone and can hear crystal clear. So I just have to deal with having a secondary hearing device to effectively use my phone.
            "
"1050","When I got this phone it was working fine. However after a few weeks it started to drain the battery. I replaced the battery and to Amazon's credit they paid for it, (I bought a battery and did it myself.) After a few months it all of a sudden started to heat up and drain very fast, so it only lasts a few hours. It looks like lots of people have this problem and Apple never resolved it. It could be hardware or software but I've tried everything. This is also happening to the 32 Gb version I bought for a friend and she has far less software on it. It drains even when in airplane mode or standby.  I took it to a repair shop and they confirmed what I had also checked, the battery was in good condition.Unfortunately I wouldn't buy another refurbished phone because this problem wasn't predicted and didn't start until after the return period.

"1051","I was a little leary, ordering a refurbished phone from online.  However I figured for the price what did I have to lose? I ordered it yesterday and it arrived today.  Was packed neatly in a box (not Apple box but who cares) along with the cord and wall plug.  After thorough examination of the phone it is flawless.  Not a hint at all that it is a refurbished phone.  Inserted my sim card, turned it on, and voila, it worked.  If their quality of refurbishing phones is this good on all phones I would not hesitate to order from them again.
            "
"1052","The product was as described (slightly used with minor damages possible small cracks). I'm very happy with the phone however I have experienced occasional issues. My phone enables me to hear the other person speaking however 1/30 calls the other person becomes unable to hear me speaking. After recontacting the individual they hear me fine, however that is quite a bad scenario which has caused a few important calls to be even more tedious. My phone came with two very small barely noticeable cracks extending to each side of the home button into the viewing portion of the screen. The cracks where shorter than a millimeter each. For my phone I clipped a metropcs sim card and placed it into the phone. I then contacted metropcs and changed the phone IEM info with their customer support. This could be the issue of my contacted individual to not be able to hear me however I do not believe that to be the case. I would recommend purchasing a blank sim card of the appropriate size and contacting metropcs for a cheap high quality service however. Wish you luck on your purchase.
            "
"1053","This phone works great.  I took it to Tmobile and they had no problems inserting the sim card from my old phone into this.  I have never had an iphone before, so when it didn't come with instructions I had to look up features on the internet.  But that is ok.  I got confused by the ringer off switch on the side, I couldn't understand why my phone wasn't ringing until I looked it up online.  Works great.  Color is a little more coral than pink but it is cute.  The Tmobile guy said that because it is plastic, if you drop it on a corner the screen can come off, so definitely invest in a case.  The size feels just right in my hand, so I actually drop it less than my larger Kyocera phone.
            "
"1054","Initially, the case I got for the phone caused the phone to act erratically..  I reinstalled the case and the phone works well.  I love the phone.  Siri works well... reminders, alarms, and text messages are a breeze.  I'm also impressed with the voice recognition.  It beats the heck out of my old android.  Call quality is excellent.  I'm very impressed with the battery life.
            "
"1055","It works great, not as sensitive to touch on certain places on the screen but I barely notice it. It has only glitched once since I bought it and all I had to do was turn it off. So far I am very happy with my purchase, thank you!
            "
"1056","I have always steered clear of refurbished merchandise in the past because I was afraid I'd getting poor quality.  I admit that I have been very pleased with this phone since purchasing it.  I have not noticed any operational problems nor any cosmetic defects.  It works great!  I definitely would suggest purchasing some sort of case for it though.  The plastic back on this phone makes it a slippery little sucker!  Thank you!
            "
"1057","I bought two iPhone 5c phones from Breed, one white and one green.  The green one has been fine but the white one stopped keeping correct time a couple months after I got it.  Tried everything, reset, etc., no luck.  I contacted the seller, but naturally, the 30 day warranty period is up and they would not offer any kind of assistance.  Unhappy with it, but I guess it's an anomaly??
            "
"1058","quality product, have not had any issues with the phone, would definitely buy again
            "
"1059","I had a great experience. I've had the phone for a little more than a month and it has worked perfectly.  Color was more coral than pink, but that doesn't really matter to me.
            "
"1060","This phone has worked out well for my son. The only complaint (and it's a frustrating one) is that there seems to be no way to turn off the camera sound when taking a picture. That limits photo ops because it makes a loud shutter sound even if the volume is turned all the way down or the phone is on silent mode. I'm surprised there is not a fix for this. Otherwise, it's been a good phone so far, but if I'd known about this problem, I would not have purchased it.
            "
"1061","We received this phone August 30th and now have been experiencing issues with it!  Can't text all the time or receive or make calls from time to time. I bought this phone for my daughter and she can't always reach meNot happy at all! !!!!!!!!! I will never buy a phone from Amazon!
            "
"1062","The phone had trouble connecting to the network from the start.  The charging cable was also bad.  I bought it as a gift for my son.  We left on vacation as soon as we started using it, only to find that the cable was bad and it wouldn't connect to the network.  We pitched the cable thinking we would just replace it, then we discovered the phone would not connect intermittently.  They refunded my money, but I had to buy a new cable for about $5 just to send it back to get a refund.  I don't recommend purchasing phones this way.  At least they provided a refund.
            "
"1063","Phone was great for about 12 days. Then it needed a system upgrade from our wireless carrier. It wouldn't download the upgrade and refused to connect with the carrier until the upgrade was finished. Apple customer service was terrible. Long holds, rude and condescending ""tech help"" people and the cherry on top - a full week wait to get an appointment at any of the local Apple stores. That just isn't good enough.I sent this phone back and ordered a new one. The new one will be in days before the appointment with Apple! Hope the new one is better. It is the last try for me with Apple phones.
            "
"1064","Item that arrived was a 5S, which was ok since that is better than the 5C.  However, the phone only worked intermittently as a cell phone, the headset jack did NOT work at all, and the charger also did not work.  I did return this item.
            "
"1065","We bought this for our teen daughter she had been bugging us for an iPhone and since she's always on her ph. she ends up dropping it or something so we bought it for way less than in a store and ours has came in great no problems so far. I hesitated to buy it due to the reviews but took a chance since it comes with a warranty.
            "
"1066","On the second day my screen shattered. My hand hit a door jam and that is all it took for the glass to crack to the point the phone was unusable. I had the exact model for 3-1/2 years and battery died, this was to replace it. I could see if I dropped it. But I didn¡¯t even drop it. Totally unusable. Buyer beware!
            "
"1067","Very disappointed!!  The phone only lasted 7 months and now it does not receive service.  After spending hours researching issues online and spending hours on the phone with AT&T, I was informed that there was a problem with the phone and I would have to purchase a new phone.  I have always kept the phone in a life proof case and it was never damaged.  Disappointed that a $185 phone didn't last longer than that!  Will never purchase again!
            "
"1068","Great phone for a preteen who is on the go and hard on phones. He loves the camera to make his skateboarding videos. The 5c was made for this type of user! And best of all I can look on my phone and see exactly where he is at all times!
            "
"1069","This was a terrific Item. When I received the Item I took it to the Apple store to have it checked out, I mentioned it was a certified refurbished phone from amazon.  Apple did there diagnostics and said it was in fantastic shape. The Item did not come with Head phones or the original charger but this was explained in the description of the Item. My only regret is I did not buy the 32 GB version. The Phone was in perfect condition no imperfections that I could at all. Easy to setup, Easy to use
            "
"1070","I am very pleased with my iPhone 5c. It arrived very early as well a day before and the Amazon drive was a young woman I knew from years ago very cool. The only issue is that the battery may be old or whatever but it dies quick. I've turned down sum settings so it wouldn't. Besides any of that I like my iPhone it's new to me using Apple products but I love it.
            "
"1071","The front camera (8MP) never works. I thought it would be a good choice to buy a refurbished one. Also, the home button is pushed in which is awful. Please do not purchase this item as its a total wastage of money. As i am in India now, its hard to digest. I lost my money spending for one bulls*** product which the seller claim its refurbished.
            "
"1072","I have edited this review because once I tested the features----the iphone is locked with AT&T. I will be returning this phone. The advertisement for this product was wrong. Not recommended.
            "
"1073","I am writing this review almost two years later, and I am still using it and loving it.
            "
"1074","The product won't hold a charge at all.  The battery is defective. I will not recommend anyone to purchase from the seller(when it comes to refurbish phones). I tried everything to get it to work and it won't charge at all.
            "
"1075","A disappointing purchase.  The phone arrived promptly and was nicely packed but the phone would not charge.  Thinking it might just be the charger, I took the phone to our local Apple Store where they confirmed the phone was defective.
            "
"1076","The phone came in relatively brand new condition,and has been a life saver. I use it to talk with my fiance,who is currently deployed overseas. Battery life is superb, and connectivity is great on GSM bands. The package arrived right on time, and I was very pleased with the decision to buy a used product! It definitely raised my expectations.
            "
"1077","Purchased phone in early evening and received it late the next morning, under 24 hours with free shipping.Bought the Apple 5c in yellow and it was exactly as described.  Looks new.  Works perfectly and even came with phone charger.I will probably buy another one to save so I have one as a back up.
            "
"1078","Absolutely great customer service!! Fast delivery and my daughter loves her new phone. Very pleased and recommend anyone to purchase from them. Great quality and everything is exactly as it should be. Happy customer!!
            "
"1079","I just got my pink 5c and when I bought it, I was told it was a GSM phone but I went to Verizon to check and make sure I couldn't go there for my phone and I could! They're convinced that it's either a CDMA phone or a GSM phone with CDMA antennas.Anyway, as far as the phone goes it's great. I just can't figure out how to turn off the camera shutter sound...the mute switch doesn't turn it off. Will definitely recommend to others!!!
            "
"1080","I had forgotten how small these iPhone 5s were! Bought it for traveling in 3rd world countries where an iPhone-X would get get too much attention. Worked flawlessly.
            "
"1081","I never buy refurbished.  But my iPhone 6 went in the pool with me and I want to wait for oPhone 8 to come out.  So I bought a 32 gig 4c to tie me over and figured I would give the 5c to my son when the 8 arrives.  First, this refurbished phone is in great shape.  There are a couple of scuffs--but more like it was repeatedly laid on a counter rather than being mishandled.  Second, I like the 5c a lot!  It's 32g rather than my 256g 6.  It doesn't allow fingerprint access.  And there is an app that says it will not run on my phone model.  But, other than that, it seems to run faster than my 6 (and I've got the latest iOS running).  I am so much more comfortable with the smaller form factor.  And, with a case, plastic is just as good as glass or aluminum.  It is light and thin compared to my last small form factor iPhone.  But it is not so thin as to be unholdable without a case--the 6 is too thin.  And, at less than $200 unlocked, I can buy my son, mother, and wife one for the presumed price of the 8.  And at that price point I'm willing to take a chance with a refurb--in this case it was a super-dooper buy.  Apple, bring back the small form factor, stop thinking razor thin is inherently valuable, and give me a download all button for iCloud photos.  They no longer all fit on my phone (the app that doesn't work on the 5c is the Microsoft camera--I hate not being able to do what I wasn't with my 3K pictures.  You think you are locking me in.  But I'm just moving over to Microsoft apps when I can.  Soon, I'll end up going with a Microsoft phone).
            "
"1082","Installation went well.  Resolution doesn't look as clear as the oem screen.  Colors are washed out a bit(not very vibrant, kind of on the greyer side) and the blacks are grey.  Brightness adjustment doesn't seem to help.  Sometimes it looks too bright and I've also seen a short time of screen burn in.  But it does the job, just reminded of the screen every time I look at it.
            "
"1083","This phone looked brand new when I received it. I was a little concerned when ordering because of some of the reviews stating they had issues with the chargers they were receiving but no such issues here. This was a gift for my step-dad who works in construction and tends to go through phones at an alarming rate. If he manages to put this one in an early grave I'm sure this will be a repeat purchase.
            "
"1084","worked for a couple of weeks then just completely went bad,very disappointed in this.im a soldier overseas that needed a quick replacement phone and didnt want to spend an arm and a leg,but this phone was a real let down,piss poor,worked long enough for the warranty to wear out
            "
"1085","The phone seems OK but there were items missing from the package the user manual and ear phones were not in the box as advertised, hence the three stars.  Package Content:1 x Phone1 x AC Wall Charger1 x USB Data Sync Cable1 x Earphones1 x User Manual
            "
"1086","My phone arrived promptly and as advertised.  I love having the extra storage space (my former phone was 16GB).  My only complaint is that you can't turn off the sound when taking photos; I've learned to put my thumb over the speaker, but it's a bit awkward.  I LOVE my phone!
            "
"1087","I love my phone! I also got the warranty with it. It is a little over sensitive, buttons press when I don't want etc, the speak sound went out but I had it reset at the store for free and now no problems at all! I love it - it holds a lot too!
            "
"1088","Excellent condition.  Would order this item again from seller.  This Apple iPhone 5c has changed my life.  I love the color BLUE!!!  It has all I need for a telephone.  Downloaded the OS software and I am very, very pleased with this item.  Thanks for the phone!!!
            "
"1089","Cost is good, but it came scratched and the screen is loose. If you I press slightly on the plastic back, the screen will protrude as if it's not glued down. I'm disappointed in the purchase as the other reviews were gleaming rave reviews. Guess some of them are fake!
            "
"1090","It is a small phone, not that great if you have trouble reading small writing. But, the battery life is very good.  I can go a whole work day and my phone will be 85% by 4:30 pm.
            "
"1091","When you get this phone, make sure that it is actually 16GB!! I bought this for my boyfriend to quickly replace his phone that got broken. I just figured out that it is NOT as advertised, we got a 8GB phone instead. Because he didn't know that it was supposed to be 16GB, he didn't tell me and now it's past the return date. Phone itself is good, works as it is supposed to but without the storage. Just make sure you double check as soon as you get phone.
            "
"1092","Buyer Beware!! My iPhone went to a black screen within the first 6 months of use. I have been completely locked out of the phone, it just died. The seller does not back up their products at all.
            "
"1093","All was well until the battery swelled last week. I sent it to a store to change it but the swelling had broken the screen too. Too expensive to fix. They told me battery was 4 years old and that was the reason why it had swollen.A really bad choice because I'm also off guarantee limits.I don't think I'll buy a phone through Amazon again.
            "
"1094","Well worth the price! Haven't activated it yet, but works well with Wifi.
            "
"1095","Battery dies quickly after 10 minutes of use on a full battery it goes to 78%. Keeps powering off every four hours or freeze. The price was amazingly great .The speaker port has to be replace the volume even all the way on max barely can hear on it. Find myself using headphones or my Bluetooth a lot.
            "
"1096","First off I received an iPhone 5C Green 8GB not a 16GB. That was strike one!Next when I went to put in a sim card as soon as I pulled the sim card holder out I noticed the sim card holder was broken on the end. Now being that I am all the way in Afghanistan I can not just return it so I took it to the phone store here on Bagram. They attempted to fit a sim card in the broken sim card holder and guess what the card got stuck in the phone and wont come out. Strike Two!The only good outcome is that the phone works, and the sim card actually works in the phone even though I cant get it back out. But overall you get three stars for false advertisement of a 16 GB iPhone and sending me a broken sim card holder.
            "
"1097","First I wasn't sure about this product but I've had it for over a month and it works perfectly like it was brand new very little signs of wear I would do this again perfect product things to the company for surprising me !

"1100","This phone was beyond expectations.  It appears to be brand new with no imperfections and thus far has given exemplary service.  As it was an unlocked phone, we were able to maintain our current service provider and had no problem in the phone's setup.  Would recommend this phone and Amazon's service to anyone.

"1105","We bought this for my daughter as a gift to celebrate her Graduation. It lasted 2 months before the phone died. She took excellent care of it and she was so sad when one day it just stopped working. Prime mobility1 wouldn't stand behind their product, so if you buy from them don't expect your phone to last more than a few months.

"1124","Overall, quality is pretty good, just camera/video shutter sound cannot be mute, which means it's Japanese model, not US model, you can not change it by OS or regional, it was set by F/W.  And, It doesn't mention on production description.
            "
"1125","Phone won't hold a charge.

After sending it to  Apple they told me  it was first registered through itunes in 2013 although I bought it in 2016!!!,, so they cannot repair and honour any kind of warranty as for them it was a 3 year old device. And I had it for only 6 months. So buying this is a gamble and I will NEVER buy  refurbished again! Very disappointed!!!!

I don't want to go into all the details but one of the final steps to transfer data is that the phone's seller has to be verified or it won't work.

            "
"1149","Exelente
            "
"1150","seems to work just fine. the only problem is the battery goes down so fast.
            "
"1151","It's nice to be able to buy an iPhone for not as much money and still know that it will work well. Buying this was just like buying a new phone. It's in perfect shape.
            "
"1152","I bought 2 of these. 1 works ok, but the second was always trouble with the touch screen. Then it was dropped on carpet and the phone broke in half. The screen came completely off the phone. I sent a report to file on the 90 day warranty and never heard back. Wouldn't order again. Waste of $200
            "
"1153","My first iPhone doesn't have iOS 11 but I like it very fast. It's not the latest greatest iPhone but you won't be disappointed
            "
"1154","Great phone, good quality and in very good condition upon arrival.
            "
"1155","Certified refurbished my butt.  Phone just showed up DOA and will not charge with 2 different chargers.  Somebody must have been asleep when they were certifying this device.
            "
"1156","After 3 month the phone batter died and started swelling busting the iPhone screen. DO NOT BUY THIS, IT's a Scam. Apple certified refurbish my balls.
            "
"1157","Bought this phone and it died 6 months later.  No warranty after 90 days.  If you buy refurbished be sure to get a 1 year warranty.
            "
"1158","Went to Verizon to get SIM card and service! So far it is working GREAT!
            "
"1159","Worked fine for a short time,  now the screen has problems.  Outside the return time, so I guess I have to pay apple to fix it or buy another.
            "
"1160","works Great no scratches  awesome purchase I highly recommend.
            "
"1161","Front facing camera came broken and unable to zoom. Top portion of touch screen did not work correctly. In process of return and pretty bummed.
            "
"1162","Had it for a few months. Only app that glitches is Youtube, but its just orientation fix. Everything works well and battery life would last you all day
            "
"1163","Please everybody, do not buy those refurbished products. My experience is, I bought one and used it for three months and then the phone was not connecting to the network. I took it to Apple Store and it was confirmed that the phone was locked from Japan and it seems it was stolen.... be careful !!!!!
            "
"1164","Please, I need some help. This cell doesn't work wellThe casing is scratched and dirty, the carger doesn't workI demand another cell phone because I've been cheated on
            "

            "
"1166","Works fine, does what I need it too. Coming from An android I'm not really sure what I was expecting.  Just hoping it lasts longer than my last few phones did
            "
"1167","The phone came with an Apple charger.  It works, and looks brand new!  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  Oh, and my wife is jealous of the pretty green color!
            "
"1168","The phone came on time and had no cosmetic damage. Internal damage, yes. As stated, refurbished and checked by a human, ...jury still out on that one. The phone constantly froze which caused me to constantly have to hit the lock button to start over. Sometimes, random buttons would key themselves almost as if a ghost was tag teaming me with the phone. Will def have to send back.
            "
"1169","Had the phone almost a month and no problems so far.
            "

"1171","Excellent product and excellent seller very satisfied!
            "

            "
"1175","From my week of experience I love this iPhone.  I upgraded from a hand me down iPhone 4.  It's been a seamless transition.  Buying a refurbished iPhone gives you the same service as going to the Apple store to buy one.  Great phone at half the price!

            "
"1179","Would be careful. At least from the seller I bought from the phone wasn't anywhere near what you'd expect from a authorized refurbished product, but the price was good. Worked out fine since it was a replacement for my daughter, otherwise would have gone back.
            "
"1180","This phone glitches up whenever I try to use the internet. Such as waste of money. I used the phone for a total of 30 hours. I hated it so much I went back to my old android phone.

"1181","As described would do business again, super-fast shipping, & great price!

            "
"1188","Gave this as a gift to a friend in the Philippines, works perfectly with no issues, Certainly as advertised, I had to provide an iphone ear phones however this seemed reasonable for personal hygiene. With 32 gigs of memory I saw this as added value and a great deal as this person likes to take a lot of pictures with the phone..!
            "
"1189","This phone only worked for about 2 weeks.  Unfortunately, I had to send it back.  Fortunately, I got a full refund.  The phone looked good and worked well initially, but then the screen began moving like an old tv that needed its antenna adjusted.  After a few days of that, it plain old wouldn't boot up or accept a charge.
            "
"1190","Good phone. Works and is handy as a second phone.

            "
"1227","Awesome

            "
"1233","good for the cost and model
            "
"1234","Works for Metro PCS ... You have to go to the store because switching the sim is not enough. They have to make a manual change

"1240","Should have never bought it. It will not hold charge
            "
"1241","Exactly what I thought I have other Apple products. Got with gift cards and a great deal.

            "
"1244","Good mobileOld model is amenable to hand.It is small.
            "
"1245","nothing came with it, no info or anything
            "
"1246","To begin let me assure you I was skeptic,- I did not think that the phone would work normally. But to my surprise, I have yet to find any defects! Everything works like normal. I also have a 5C that's new from sprint so I can compare. For the price, the 32 GB is a steal of a deal. And its unlocked so you can use it even without a sim. But you won't be able to unlock the phone without a sim. So here's what you do: Take a sim from another phone  that's activated and one that fits of course. Use it to active the phone and get to the home screen. Once there you can just remove the sim and place it back in the original phone. Your phone will work for everything apple ID related: facetime, text, etc. I bought this phone for my grandfather (I put a case on it so he doesn't know its pink haha) so he can take it overseas and put a sim in it and use it there. In conclusion great product if you are a bit tech savvy/ do your research on how to use an unlocked phone to its max potential
            "
"1247","I brought this for my brother no complains. Works for me.
            "

"1285","Product was not working as soon as I received it. The screen had a white streak and nothing else could be seen. The return was done as soon as I shipped it back without any problem. I guess it was just my bad luck because I ordered another one and it worked perfectly. They are refurbished so I don't want my review being the reason you don't get this phone. The second phone I ordered worked great and still does. Just want people to be aware that sometimes this happens and at least I got my refund without a problem and the second one I ordered was working fine.

"1322","i was a bit hesitant to buy this reading some of the reviews, but I ordered one for myself and one for my husband and so far they have been fantastic.  They are refurbished so of course they don't come in the original packaging or with earbuds or stickers but for less than $200, who cares?  The phones had no scratches or visible signs of wear and work perfectly so far.  Again so far they are working perfectly. I would definitely recommend this to someone who doesn't care about having the latest iPhone and doesn't want to pay to do that dumb leasing thing they all want you to do anymore.

"1329","Firstly I was a little nervous about this purchase as I have ordered reconditioned phones before - for myself and family members - and its been a disaster. However, after my bought on release day iPhone 5 failed - and I do use a phone a LOT for work - I opted to give this a shot. And I am very glad I did. Arriving in a day instead of the two that my Prime Membership promises was good and the phone itself even better. If it is used you certainly can't tell. Everything functioned as it should, and the charger plug, lightening cable and headphones that came with it were fine too and it was very well packaged. I saw a few reviews complain about the plain packaging. Why? It's very solid (with more protective foam than my straight from Apple Day One phone had) and does the job.

"1375","I couldn't be more satisfied!  Purchased this as a gift for someone, and they're really happy with it!  The condition of the product cosmetically is amazing.  As soon as I opened the box and looked at it, it feels like a brand new iPhone.  And so far it's had no problems functionally either.  Fantastic!  As everyone knows iPhones are expensive, but this is a great deal, even if it is a couple years older now.If you need to update to a newer iPhone,  but don't want to pay the high price of a brand new iPhone give a refurbished one a try.  Great buy!

"1377","Awful. Ordered for my son for Christmas and the touch screen stopped responding to touch within 3 days. A hard reset and a factory reset did not fix the problem. Others have had this same thing happen if you read the reviews. My guess is they refurbished these units with cheap replacement screens and not Apple OEM screens and the digitizers are junk. This one is being returned. Buyer beware.
            "

"1384","First time writing a review...but was so happy with purchase and delivery!...I read tons of reviews for the iPhone 5c...some people who ordered a 'new' one said it didn't look new at all when it came...that made me nervous to go over 300 just to find out of wasn't a new phone at all...I went with the refurbished...my daughters bday was in a few days..ordered phone overnight mail (20 dollars)....came to my door next day as promised!...looked great!...new condition!..not a scratch or anything!...she loved it!...I'm glad I got this one instead of paying 100 more ....
            "
"1385","Completely disappointed. Outside is scratched. Was supposed to be unblocked for any carrier, but it is an old Verizon phone, which is not compatible with all networks, regardless of the unlock.
            "
"1386","Works great for my cousin
            "
"1387","Ordered one and it came as a 8GB so i had to return that. Ordered another and it was damaged in the inside so i couldn't get signal from carrier.

"1388","Just right! No problems.

"1397","Great phone!
            "
"1398","I was uneasy about purchasing a refurbished phone online, but I have to say I'm VERY Pleased with my purchase. The phone arrived quickly, looked brand new and operates as if it were brand new as well.  I'm as happy with this phone as I've been with any other phone I've purchased brand new.  Happier in fact because it was so much cheaper.  It was a great experience and when I need to upgrade I'll likely purchase refurbished from Amazon again.

"1428","Unfortunately I am having a lot of issues with this phone; I am still working out with the provider if this is something that has to do with the phone plan or the phone itself. Currently T-Mobile is tellilng me it is the phone. Will keep investigating.

"1430","Garbage mobile phone. Only to buy a few days on the screen is not easy to use, according to a long time will have a response. Phone signal is very poor, the battery 100% of the electricity does not play the game half a day without electricity. On the appearance of bright and beautiful, which are rubbish.

"1436","I bought this for my 10 year old daughter. She loves the phone. It was in brand new condition when it arrived. I went to the at&t store and got a sim card for it and added her to my plan. It was seamless. Now to figure out how to get her to put it down.....

"1438","Nice phone and working good.
            "
"1439","Product in excellent condition, came with a protective plastic face both on screen and behind the device, the iPhone comes with a power charger inclueye not the headphones, the phone functions are correct it comes installed with IOS 7.
            "
"1440","It's great! The phone was in a good condition and charger works. If you're looking for cheap iPhone devices, this will be it (iPhone 5c)
            "
"1441","The unit looks good but it doesn't charge properly. The battery is not working.Update on the phone (4/17/16) :After charging it fully, battery life was just good for 2 hours. And now just right now my daughter noticed that the upper left portion of the phone just popped, it open the corner. Spent $200+ for a 3 month usage of celphone. Waste of money!
            "
"1442","This is NOT what is advertised.  It says pink, it is actually a neon orange, about the color of a street pylon.  I am returning it and will buy from someone else.
            "
"1443","I ordered this phone for my daughter and also paid extra to have it delivered the next day. I did get it the next day with no problem. The problem came once I opened the box and looked over the phone. There is a big deep scratch on the home button, the display screen has a pink tint only in the center of screen, can see on a white background. The pink on the phone in some spots are like a orange color. Like around the rear camera and flash, bottom of phone where charger and speaker are. Also near top where power button is that area as well. They say that their products are like new and highly good refurbished well I would like a replacement sent to me overnighted so that my daughter can enjoy her phone. I have never had a refurbished iPhone look like this, the normally like new with no scratches, no screen issues, and no discoloration of the body. I was trying to request a replacement, but only opt motion is just a refund. I didn't want to do a refund as this is my daughter favorite color and I surprised her a brought it at a great price but no happy with the phones appearance. Please contact me back to replace my phone.
            "
"1444","Not unlocked. Had to return it.
            "
"1445","Words great! Some minor cosmetic signs but fully functional. Used in a GSM provider as as soon as i put the SIM card the set up process automatically started.
            "
"1446","Worked for less than 6 months before it just randomly died.  It's a brick now and won't do a thing.  At first it worked great, but not worth the money for less than 6 months use.
            "
"1447","Arrived as advertised in near flawless condition.  A good value shipped in a timely manner.  Very impressive.
            "
"1448","This phone was amazing. It came in a generic box with a Charger and charger base. I was worried about getting a refurbished phone especially after reading the mixed reviews. I LOVE this phone. It works exactly like a brand new phone and I feel like it was a great price for what I got. It chargers very quickly which is amazing because I am always on it.
            "
"1449","Yes I received the phone I wanted, and it was in okay condition, but after 3 months of having it, it already is glitching, constantly freezing, shutting down apps, not allowing me to delete pictures, not allowing me to do certain tasks on it, sometimes parts of the phone don't respond when you click on them, ect. Good temporary phone, for calling and texting , but not in good enough condition for what I need it to do.
            "
"1450","Ordered this iPhone for my mom, it arrived in time and perfectly assembled.Thank you!
            "
"1451","This IPhone 5c it's not unlock. There is more issues about this device. Please don't buy it. Bad purchase.
            "
"1452","Don't get these refurbished phones. They are super slow and glitchy.
            "
"1453","it does not work as good as my former motorola handset in picking up wifi hotspot signals that I had to let go for some issues with its hit and miss audio... But, it IS an iphone!
            "
"1454","I was bit skeptical buying this product as it was reimbursed. I been using this for some days and it works just fine. The phone came in a custom box along with an apple charger. Found that phone screen behaves irrational when connected with charger provided with the package and works fine when i connnect it with my iPad's charger. The charger could be faulty or some issue with iPhone 5c. Not sure what it is.Still Im rating this 4 stars because this is my first iPhone and im pretty much impressed.
            "
"1455","Worked fine for about 3 months, then the battery began to swell.  It got so big that it busted the screen out of he phone and It stopped working all together.  This is the second phone bought from here that is unusable!!  Don't do it!!
            "
"1456","Definitely worth purchasing. The phone came in excellent condition and I had no problems setting it up. Highly recommend purchasing from these guys.
            "
"1457","This was my daughters first true attempt with online shopping. Other than some shipping issues, the device is on point. It was great that we tested this phone with different sims and they all worked. I was able to prove to my daughter to always pay cash for a phone, and not be attached to anyone company. The quality of the product and performance made her a believer.
            "
"1458","it worked as expected although the charger did not work and i wasn't able to get a replacement.
            "
"1459","excellent product very good buy

"1460","A bit iffy since its refurbished. Freezes sometime.
            "
"1461","So far been loving it, was able to connect it with Metro PCS. Only thing I did not like was that the charger is not apple nor did it work.
            "
"1462","Phone worked fine once I got it going but had issues with it freezing up and heating up way too fast. Nice look though looked almost brand new.

            "
"1464","purchased the phone on Feb 25th 2016.  Phone stopped working on or about April 19th 2016.  Waste of money.  I should have known.
            "
"1465","Received an iphone 5c that doesn't work at all. The apple logo flashed once, but then the screen went black. Its wasted my time by having me unpack it, then pack it back up, and drop off for return shipping. I am very unhappy with this experience. If I could, I'd rate it zero stars. Its a complete waste of my time.

"1491","This phone is in good condition and works very well. As with most iPhones, I wish battery life was a little better, but I use my phone quite a biyt. No problem with the seller at all and the warranty is good. I immediately put a tempered glass screen protector on it and a padded cover. The phones really should be made tougher than they are. It is possible!! But not this seller's fault. It's 32 gig. Can't complain!
            "
"1492","Bought this phone for my 12 year old daughter -as I wanted an unlocked phone for her to use with 'pay-as-you-go' type contracts.Rarely used by her for PHONE CALLS (lots of texting to friends, though).The headset speaker  (required to be able to actually use it as a PHONE) failed after only 4 months.---I bet if we check the call log on the phone; it has less than 30 min of phone CALLS on it.---Contacted seller to ask about repair options for this 'CERTIFIED REFURBISHED' phone - and received a prompt response saying they have few returns or problems and would fix this right away with a replacement/refund.  Responded with 'thanks!  My daughter likes the phone, so we will certainly opt for the replacement option!' - then received a follow-up response from them saying ""oh -sorry.  We only have a 90-day return policy."" (even though I was clear of the date that I had bought the phone in my first contact)Responded to ask them about 'what are the repair options then with Apple for a CERTIFIED REFURBISHED phone? '- and they haven't bothered to respond.Waste of money - should have bought new, rather than trusting this company and its 'CERTIFIED REFURBISHED phones... fail at 30 days beyond the '90 DAY GUARANTEE!' window - and you are out +$300, with a phone that doesn't work!

"1498","I don't know why I thought I needed a cell phone.  It's nothing but a pain and a money sucker.

"1499","First, I noticed that the phone was loose in the box and the only protection was a flimsy screen protector and AIRplus on the top. Then the phone said it had no SIM card and sure enough there is no SIM card. Lastly there are no headphones and the charger is a junky one obviously not from Apple. EXTREMELY unhappy, and can't contact seller.

"1500","Was very pleased with my purchase. I bought this for my sister and she loves it. No issues with the battery, not problems with the screen or in its normal functions. All is well. Does not come with headphones but it does come with a (not apple) charger that works just fine. Very pleased. Would buy from them again.
