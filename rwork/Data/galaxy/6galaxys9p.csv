"1","Received the phone. It worked fine for the first 6 weeks,then I lost battery power  I turned the phone off at night while charging, did not help. Then every else started to fail. Was sent to ""Youbrakeifi ""  by Samsung  tech support. Diagnostic showed a flawed motherboard. I am leaving for overseas  next week. Amazon  declined  refund,so I have no phone. This the only way I can communicate,  no other phone in house. I have to spend an other$700 today to buy a phone. Will never ever purchase a phone from Amazon. No support.

"2","Repackaged with sticky cellophane that left adhesive on back of phone and camera lenses that can't be removed. Finger sensor appears dirty.  And nothing was in box except phone. No papers, no chargers, no headset. Nothing.
            "
"3","The box I received didn't have a phone in it!!! instead, it had a cheap plastic phone case. Also, the box had no seal on it so it could have been tampered with at any point. I watched ""unboxing"" videos for this phone, and there's supposed to be a sticker seal you have to break to open the box. From other reviews, it sounds like other customers have received empty boxes or dummy phones.Customer service is processing a replacement. Hopefully that goes alright. I'll update the review when I have more info on the replacement.

"4","When the phone arrived excited to use  it then boom it does not work! It is an UNLOCKED phone they say but it really isn't. Their Customer Service stinks  and are no help. I want my money back!

"5","I am a die hard Apple person. All my desktop computers at home are Apple, my other 4 family members all have iPhones and we have laptops that are all Apple. Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far. I was using a 4 1/2 year old iPhone 5s so I figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. It still takes a little getting used to coming from the IOS system's way of doing things. I do lose the capability of iMessage and FaceTime. Not a huge deal and I can use the DUO app from Google which is the same as FaceTime. The key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great. I like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration). I think the new iPhone X does this too but again, I'm coming from a 5s. My only two choices for a new phone were this S9+ or keep on with Apple and get an iPhone X. The X would have cost me $1150 plus an AppleCare warranty for $200. I got this Samsung (and got the Ultimate Play Bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle. Took out a Square Trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should I need to use it. I have used Square Trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee. Square Trade is owned by Allstate so I have confidence in them. Getting back to the phone, the S9+ seems to work VERY fast when loading apps and pages. I use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (Nest thermostat, wireless cameras, LIFX lights, Liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly. The audio when playing music sounds great. Plays very loud and clear for a phone. I like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack. I like the Android system as it comes with Google Assistant voice command. Most people hate the Bixby feature on this phone. My only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume I accidentally hit Bixby sometimes. I do like though that i's voice activated. I get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up Bixby and command it to open up whatever app I need (usually Waze). Once open, I speak to Waze to take me to work. All of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road. Also, the Bixby AI camera function is very cool too. There are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera. Like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to English or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone). Point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count. Point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...). The ONLY thing I think I will never use again and of course I tried it out is the Animoji of myself or any of my friends. It's scary weird. Everyone looks the same on this. I would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3D type and look more realistic. I have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others. Mot notably the iPhone X. In my opinion, the X does do a lot of pix better. The contrast is usually better. The real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit. So, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iPhone X. The only thing I had to get used to is the colors on a Samsung phone are very oversaturated. Colors are very bright. There is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view. I turned it down to one of them and it now looks a LOT more realistic. I like the fact that this phone, as well as the iPhone X, features ability to record video at 4K 60fps. Looks great. On the Samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4K 60fps. Keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue. For all other video formats, the stabilization on the Samsung works better than the X. All in all, I am happy I went with the Samsung. In a few months if I regret it, I can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iPhone X Plus.UPDATE: 4/7/2018.  The voice unlock code is terrible. And, after searching through the options on the phone I came to the conclusion I don't need it. I have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back. I actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use. Battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now. One thing I find annoying that I didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting. Whether I send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all. This is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space. I was used to having an iPhone and using iMessage. Send any size video to someone else with an iPhone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text. Not so with Android. Now this is not just Samsung but all Android phones. So, for now, I have to send videos via WhatsApp or Viber (or a number of other text apps). They do compress but not horribly. Oh, and one more note. I hope Samsung corp is reading this review. The Samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people I have ever dealt with for a tech company. I used to think Comcast was bad until I called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at Samsung. They just repeat my question and tell me they understand how I feel offering absolutely no answers. They put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve. Just terrible customer service. 180 degrees from dealing with someone at AppleCare when I had a question about my iPhone or iMac computer.2nd UPDATE: I didn't  realize this and this is VERY important to know before purchasing. In fact, I'm on the AT&T network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this. The sales people in Best Buy in the phone department did not know this either. When you buy an unlocked Galaxy S9 or S9+, your phone is $840. If however you want to buy it thru AT&T for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it. Meaning, the unlocked phone WILL NOT have: WIFI calling option, HD Audio option, VVM (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling. The option for these features is not even on my phone. Now, you CAN buy the AT&T phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone). After you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the AT&T phone unlocked and then you will have these features. Nowhere at Best Buy or any AT&T store do they tell you this. In my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing. I picked up the bundle package here on Amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so I'm keeping my setup. I just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get. I figured the AT&T version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed. Hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features. And, I went to the AT&T store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone. There isn't. They cannot update your phone to get these options.3rd UPDATE: April 15th, 2018I discovered a great feature today. I wish these Galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iPhone X has. You pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go. What I discovered is setting the Google Assistant to open the Galaxy EVEN FROM the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the Google Assistant to do. Love this feature immensely.4th UPDATE April 23, 2018As I play around more with this phone, I am learning some cool things it can do. For instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray. No need for repetition with swiping either up or down. There is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from Samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you. Even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier). Also, one thing Samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the Oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate. Now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control MEDIA volume no matter what you are viewing. And, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the MEDIA volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them. Apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the Galaxy phones that is now solved.

"9","I ordered the unlocked single-SIM USA version of this phone (SM-G960U) which is compatible with all USA carriers. That same model number was stamped on the exterior label of the box. However, inside the box was the cheaper, dual-SIM international phone (SM-G960F/DS) which won't work with Verizon or Sprint CDMA bands.I ordered from Amazon because the phone price was discounted $50, but this turned out to be a disappointing experience and waste of time. From now on I will buy my cell phones in person at an authorized distributor to make sure I get what I am paying for.

"13","I switched to the s9 after I saw the price of the iPhoneX. I am not disappointed with switching to Samsung, this phone has a much better display and camera than the iPhones do. The pictures in the dark are phenomenal. It was easy to transfer all the data from my iPhone because of the easy set up features. If your thinking about switching from the iPhone, do it, you will not be disappointed.

I live in the US, but the model I received was SM-G960F/DS, which is an unlocked version with dual sim for the UK.

"19","<U+00A0>After doing about a month of research for what I want a phone to do and how much battery life and other features inside a phone it beats all the other phones I've had out of the water.  Granted I've only have phones 2013 or older this is like a night and day difference for my experience with phones.Pros - Sound quality out of the speakers is phenomal with highs not being too tiny and the bass not being too overbearing. - Picture quality set to the max QWHD+ is a glorious thing - Camera us stronger than a Canon G7X that i recently purchased only downside being the zoom function makes it rather quick to get blurry.  - Beautiful slo-mo option for video capture  - Selfie camera is amazing as well with the filter options to clear up a face and also has a wide selfie option for large groups of people  - Video recording is phenomenal with tracking and motion capturing - Lightning fast loads on apps and web pages when my connection is strong. - Fingerprint open on the back of phone conveniently placed - Iris Scanning - Plenty of battery life for a full days use of gps tracking and music playing - Samsung Pay option for paying for items without needing to pull out a cardCons - Camera zoom function isn't doing much good for picture quality but I understand it is in a small handheld device - Price tag as always with flagship phones are rather high but paying it out right for me and flipping the phone for newer flag ships in the future doesn't make it all that expensive of a purchase when I go with a resale value in a couple years.All in all I do enjoy this phone and for me I found it this phone to be completely worth it as just through the experience I've had with the pictures and battery life alone.  It has yet to have any hiccups while using the phone and always does what I need it to do.Only con that I have against it would be the price otherwise the phone is a complete stellar buy.

Add the wireless charger, ear buds, and watch, and you've got yourself an amazing smartphone experience.You do need to get a cover for the glass back though, because it's not as strong as it is proposed to be. Get the Alcantara case from Samsung. Also, stick with apps from the play store, and themes from Samsung ¢â, you'll have a hitch free, glitch free ride..

"21","Arguably the best smartphone that I've ever purchased.  Works great and plenty of great features.  Great camera.I had no real problems switching the SIM card from my old phone to the S9+.So why did I give it only 4 stars?  Well, I find Bixby of little value for me and I accidentally press its button at times.  Also that Facebook is permanently installed (can be ""disabled"").  However according to my router of my WiFi network, there is communications to and from Facebook (unknown which source/app on the phone is the cause).

I'm thinking it was the phone because I upgraded to the S9 plus and am now absolutely in love with it. I did order this one 1st though and had a lot of trouble with the voice to text. Actually texting was really hard in general too. That made it kind of a bummer to play around on because I use voice command a LOT. I decided to return it and just got my refund.. I am so thankful I was able to get that at least!! That's the only reason I rated at 3 stars instead of only two.

"24","I purchased this phone some months ago and was extremely excited to try it out. It arrived perfectly with all the parts and pieces it was supposed to come with and for the first two months I was completely satisfied with my purchase. I'd also took measures and purchased a heavy duty phone case and a screen protector to make sure this puppy lasted me a while. However, two months in, my phone started unexpectedly freezing and the battery life was starting to decline rapidly. I had only used 18 of the 64 GB available but I took the time to clean out my storage and any unnecessary files anyways in hopes that the phone's behavior would improve. To my surprise, its performance was rapidly declining more and more by the days. Not long after it got to the point where my phone screen would randomly turn itself off and not turn back on. The phone would vibrate like it would when it was on when I'd press the home button but the screen would not light up. It would do this multiple times a day and I would have to manually soft reset it every single time. I reached out to Samsung support and was not able to receive any help or answers from them. By this point my 30-day warranty had already expired and Amazon would no longer be able to exchange the phone for me. I wish I had just spent a few dollars extra to make sure that I had received a reliable phone. Very unsatisfied

"25","Just ordered this device to replace an older S7 Edge whose battery expanded on me and took the back of the phone out with it as it expanded - that phone was only three years old but well beyond its warranty.I hope the battery on the S9 won't go the way the S7 did.Enabling the S9 on the Verizon network only involved swapping the SIM card between devices.  It confused me a bit because it was my understanding I would have to register the devices exchange on the Verizon website.  It happened automatically after installing the old SIM card in the new phone.The device came with Android Oreo from February 2018 installed - needed a couple of patch updates.  It also came charged 96%.The S9 has a smaller screen, it's a bit lighter and much more responsive  than the S7 Edge.  It could also be that it's new so Android isn't as bloated, although it has all my data and apps moved over.  Transferring data and settings was a snap - used the Samsung utility and USB cable adapter to do this.Good experience so far to get going, if something happens, I'll be back here to amend this review.  Excellent experience so far with both the phone and Amazon's handling of it.

"28","The battery life was shorter than a new phone. The phone itself was fine but the description was misleading as #1 the ""US Warranty"" stated in the title is void when reselling a used phone. It also states, ""Accessories may have cosmetic damage"" this was false as well because the original items were completely replaced by generic headphones and power cord. You will not receive what was promised unless you buy a new phone, which I had to do. I had to return this item, and am still waiting for my refund.

"29","I bought this phone because it could be used with CDMA and SIM cards both.  I had planned on using Verizon at home and wanted to be able to purchase SIM cards to use in the phone when I travel internationally.  But this phone appears to be an AT&T phone that is ""unlocked"" so that it can also be used on T-mobile and presumably, other SIM cards.  I have wasted a week's time, tried a couple of different SIM cards from a couple of different carriers, purchased a new SIM card, and am just DONE with this.  Do not believe the Q&A section where it says the phone can be used with all 4 carriers.  It absolutely CANNOT.  I will be returning this.

I'm happy I decided to get the plus edition of the S9 as it offers a lot of extra features for the value in addition to higher quality components and screen size and resolution.

"31","My three stars has more to do with Amazon's screw up than the phone itself.WHEN YOU GET YOUR PHONE, CHECK THE MODEL NUMBER !!!SHOULD BE SM-G960U1.I ordered the US unlocked Galaxy S9 (model number SM-G960U1), BUT Amazon sent me a Chinese unlocked phone (model number SM-G9600). Although they look the same, the Chinese phone only sort of works (dropped calls, poor sound quality, incoming calls go straight to voice mail), does NOT have a US warranty (all support comes out of China), and critical features your carrier offers will be disabled (such as T-Mobile's Wifi Calling).It took me over a month to figure out why my wonderful Galaxy S9 was a piece of crap. And neither Amazon nor Samsung were of much help in discovering the source of my problem. It wasn't until I tried to register my phone with Samsung's U.S. website and failed that I got a clue.After much to do, Amazon replaced my Chinese phone with the correct one. Like magic everything appears to be working fine including Wifi Calling.

"34","My S7 Edge LCD screen just died last month so I needed a phone right away. I am currently with Verizon, so it sort of limits my phone choices. This phone works with Verizon, it was cheaper than buying it directly from Verizon, and I didn't have to pay an activation fee since I used my old sim card.In all honesty, I like the looks of the S7 Edge better than this S9. I also miss having a physical button at the bottom of the phone.Passive battery life on the S9 has been amazing so far. My old phone would be almost completely drained by the end of the day if I just checked it every once in a while. With the S9, I was periodically checking my phone once in a while, sending texts, etc., and I still had over 50% by midnight. Some apps do kill the battery life pretty quickly, but the phone will notify you every once in a while when it notices you have apps running in the background.Have not had time to play around with Bixby yet.

"35","this is the best (and most beautiful) phone of 2018, hands down.Pixel 3 xl has a worse processor, less RAM, worse battery, no equalizer, no DeX, no hdmi output, no SD slot, the stupid notch, and is $200 more expensive.iPhone Xs Max has similar performance, no fingerprint sensor, worse battery life, no SD slot, the stupid notch, no DeX, and is $400-600 more expensive.Note 9 is too big for one-handed use, too big for most pockets, has the same processor as this phone, but is $300 more expensive (tho if u use the sPen, that's the best phone for u).seriously, i waited for all the flagship announcements, only to find out that the s9+, announced 6 months ago, is still the best phone of the year, and it's not even close.completely customizable, and just a pleasure to use. the new Samsung software is much better than the old bulk in the days of S3 or even Note3. I'm coming from Pixel XL, and i can vouch for this sw being very lightweight, useful, and snappy.also, the always-on-display is just a pleasure. i don't think I'll want to go back to not having this option. battery life is amazing.

"37","I Upgraded to the Galaxy S9 from the Galaxy S3. There are many improvements, however a lot was familiar. Used it on the AT&T network. It was easy getting a SIM from them and replacing the S3 on my account.  One note:  AT&T does not call the Galaxy S9 by name on your account device page because you did not buy it from them.  They simply call it a ""device"".  This designation does not cause any issues with billing or anything else on your account. I asked support to change ""device"" to Galaxy S9, but it never went through.  The camera itself has beautiful playback of all forms of media and has a great battery life. I'm not wild about the sidebar tabs to stow all your contacts and apps, I think they get in the way of other things you are doing.  Summary: great phone.

"40","It's clear now that mine arrived defective. A problem started as intermittent and got worse: people couldn't hear me on speakerphone, and sometimes in handset mode too. I had a long call with tech support 3 months in, which ended in my hard-resetting the phone. The problem seemed to go away but didn't really. Then I dropped the phone getting a functional, and barely visible crack. I eventually confronted the problem again, calling tech support. I mentioned the crack and they said this would not impede repair under warranty. As instructed, I brought it to UfixIbreak, where I was told that a) the drop voided the warranty for all parts b) they would replace the broken part without also doing the screen even though I didn't need it done. So the cost for me was not zero but $340.When my Korean car gets rear-ended, does that automatically void all the warranty on all the engine parts?I am livid and definitely won't buy a Samsung again.

"41","Has the typical OEM bloatware as well as some Google and third-party software that can't be removed. The hardware Bixby button is an obvious attempt at overriding Google assistant.  It's very easy to activate unintentionally.A Samsung account is necessary to use their competing features; even some that don't make sense to need an account.The screen is brilliant and beautiful. The curved edges give it an attractive illusion of depth. Battery life is very good and recharge is very fast.  Samsung has the best swipe and predictive qwerty of all brands I've owned.I'm very happy with my purchase.

"42","I purchased this Amazon warehouse purchase because I could not bring myself to pay full price for todays high end smartphones.  After looking at the product I received it looks and functions as new.  I am deducting two stars because I tried to register the phone for warranty service to find that it couldn't be registered.  So I'm pulling one star for amazon listing it as having a US warranty, and one star from Samsung for not being able to register the product.  I will continue to test the functionality of this phone in the coming week.  Great value for the money if Samsung supports the product as advertised.

"43","This phone was not compatible with Sprint network. We spent half our day at 2 different Sprint stores in an attempt to activate this phone. I also purchased a otterbox case and screen protector which I am losing $15 on becuase seller is charging me for the return.

"44","Several reviews said this unlocked phone would be fine with Boost Mobile.  Took it into a boost store and the lady behind the counter was really nice and she tried and tried and could not get it to work with Boost.  Even though Boost sells this exact same phone.... hmm...  Nice gimmick, boost.  She did say the phone was sprint compatible.  Boost is owned by Sprint and its phones will run on the Sprint network.  So, what gives Boost?
            "
"45","I read all the reviews and decided to go with the Amazon shipped version of this phone to have the Amazon guarantee.  A lot of reviews said this phone would not work on Verizon, and that voicemail and wireless calling was not going to work.  Well, all of these comments were obviously from people who didn't investigate it thoroughly.  My wireless calling works fine, my voicemail works fine and the phone works on Verizon.  Here is what I discovered that you will need to do if you purchase this phone if you putting it on Verizon.  Be sure to register an account with Samsung Galaxy store right on the phone and update all of your apps and when you do, it will give you Samsung Essentials and visual voicemail that is just like Verizon's only with a Blue Icon instead of Red.  Works the same.  If you go into the settings, and turn on wireless calling, it might take a couple of tries, but it does come on, and it does work as I live in a completely shielded home where Verizon's signal does not penetrate my walls or roof and my phone works perfectly over wireless.  As far as getting connected to Verizon goes, all you have to do is take your SIM card from your old phone and put it in the new phone.  If you have to get a new SIM card from Verizon because of size difference, have Verizon register a new SIM to your old phone, then you put it into the new phone.  These phones are approved on Verizon's list of phones, but their system does not recognize the IMEI number and says it is not compatible and won't let the stores customer service reps scan the phone into their system.  You have to put your old SIM into the new phone and then it works perfectly.  I called 611 while I was in the store and they told me how to get around their system not recognizing the IMEI numbers as valid.The unlocked S9+ is the best phone I have ever had..... totally happy with my purchase.

"46","I like the phone but this one died. The other 2 are working great.  The exchange is slow especially when you need your phone. Still haven't got the replacement.
            "
"47","I bought two of these for the kids. We went to a Sprint store to get them activated and switched over from the old phones. Both needed a sim card installed, only 5 bucks each so no big deal there. These S9's were upgrades from our S6 and Note5 which did not use sim cards.They have both been in use for a few weeks now and I have not heard any complaints.  They look nice and the battery seems to last all day if fully charged.Buying them on Amazon means no re-upping my Sprint contract, which is good because I prefer to minimize my commitments to any contract.

"48","I've been wanting a Samsung S series phone since the S4. I finally bit the bullet and bought the factory unlocked S9 and I couldn't be happier with a phone! There are very minor, MINOR things about it that are hardly worth mentioning that bug me, such as not having an emoji search function (see? Not even worth mentioning), but OMG I'm in love with this thing.  I'm officially a convert.  It's worth every penny.  Make sure its FACTORY unlocked! Otherwise you won't be able to update the OS.Phone came beautifully packaged brand new with charger and headphones.
            "
"49","This is my first time buying an unlocked phone online and I feel like I got more than I bargained for. The Super AMOLED screen is hands down one of the best I have seen on a smartphone and I am enjoying it very much. Same goes for the speakers.In addition to that, I got to ""pixelize"" my phone, download tons of apps, files and I have to say I have not suffered from the infamous samsung lag, but if it does slow down at one point, samsung does have a function to test, diagnose and optimize your phone so I plan on taking advantage of that in the future.I'm also very satisfied with the battery. I'm a heavy user and so far it has been lasting me for a full day whereas my previous phone needed to be charged twice per day.As for the camera, I have yet to fully test what it's capable of, but I've taken a few low light pictures and have been quite impressed by how nice they looked.All in all this is a great phone and definitely a worthy purchase.

"51","I retrurned the device(galaxy s9+) that i got from this seller(relliant celular) because it was not new and it was not unlocked like the seller claims on the selling page (did not work with Verizon). I spent some more money and bought it eventualy at best buy and it works great and its also new so make your decisions... this called misleading the customer
            "
"52","When I called Samasung tech support about the S9+ muffled quality of the phone's microphone (complaints from people I've called), I discovered, from Samsung, there was only 5-months of warranty remaining. The phone is supposed to have a 1-year warranty.Calling Amazon, they now tell me that the warranty began when they took possession of the phone, not when I take possession of the phone. Now, Samsung includes all the warranty information in the packaging, however Amazon doesn't deem it necessary to provide clear-and-full disclosure of this important bit of information. This lack of full disclosure could be extremely expensive. To be clear, you're getting a perfectly new phone from Amazon but...without the full warranty.I am, of course returning the phone. Sad, that I have been very pleased with Amazon for a long time only to discover this lack of clear disclosure in the packaging. I am well aware the phone has a 1-year warranty, but you must dig through the fine print to find this is not true if purchased through Amazon. If your new phone is sitting on a shelf in their warehouse, then your warranty is slowly expiring.After discovering this, I had no interest in trouble shooting a problem with the S9+ micorphone which turns out to NOT be compatible with the new, higher-quality, high-security standard of VoLTE phone calling. With the S9+, you're paying for this feature on this next generation phone -- though Samsungs product, here, is flawed. Samsung's work around is to deactivate your 4G VoLTE feature. This means audio and Video calls are reverted back to the fuzzy dark ages.

"54","Excellent smartphone for the busy professional as well as for those moments when you just need to relax and unwind. A super fast processor and an awesome camera that is above average. I especially like the speed with which the Intellegent Scanner and Fingerprint Scanner both work to unlock the screen. This comes in handy in situations where you need a quick peek at messages or other info on the notification panel. The best smartphone that Samsung has ever produced and definitely the best smartphone for 2018.
            "
"55","The phone is fast, with a solid build.  But the signal reception is horrible.  At my home the signal is always weak, but my Motorola G5 Plus had much better reception.  The range for cell service is -50 to -120.  Closer to -50 is better, but this S9 is -118 in a weak area, but still -113 in a good area!  If you don't need a 3.5mm headphone jack, then get the Z3 Play.  It's far better as a phone, and motorola really knows what they're doing with convenience.  I loved my G5+, but I loved my Samsung S3, S4 and S5 too.  But this S9 is pretty poor.

"56","I WAS SKEPTICAL AND AFRAID TO BUY AFTER READING EVERY SINGLE REVIEW. I HOWEVER GAVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. IT WAS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE AND I REGRET EVERY DAMN SECOND. I HAD THIS PHONE FOR LITERALLY 8 HOURS! 8 DAMN HOURS. FOR THE FIRST FEW HOURS THE PHONE TURNED ON THE GRAPHICS ON THIS PHONE LOOKED AMAZING. I LEFT FOR A STORE RUN TO BUY A PHONE CASE AND SCREEN PROTECTOR. I WAS EXCITED. I PUT ON THE SCREEN PROTECTOR AND AS I WENT TO TURN IT ON....NOTHING... BLACK SCREEN. I DID EVERYTHING. I TRIED TO RESET IT, HARD RESET, PLUGGED IT IN TO ITS CHARGER NOTHING. BUNCH OF BULL. JUST DON'T BUY FROM THEM. DON'T EVEN BOTHER. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THIS VENDOR IS EVEN STILL ALLOWED TO SELL PRODUCTS. THEY NEEDTO BE TAKEN DOWN. AMAZON NEEDS TO KNOW HOW THEY ARE EFFING THEIR CUSTOMERS OVER. JUST STAY AWAY.

"58","I have just received it, and it¡¯s great that there¡¯s an option to transfer data onto it from other phones, including my iPhone SE. Other reviews claimed that there was no phone in the box, or accessories were missing. This made me a bit skeptical and worried, but I¡¯m glad I took the gamble. A beautiful phone, and the infinity screen makes it more beautiful. Fingerprint scanner is an a very efficient place and takes less than 3 seconds to set up. I will be back with another review in a month or so.

"59","Lovin' this phone! Clobbered the front of its S9 predecessor, so I ordered this phone and simply switched SIM cards ... bingo, connected to the AT&T network without a hitch. These phones are so smart - it downloaded/uploaded all the prior info from the dead phone. Buy with confidence. Thanks, Amazon for offering ""unlocked"" phones!
            "
"60","Very happy with my purchase. I was a little skeptical ordering it online, but decided to give it a go. Phone came within a couple days of ordering. Packaging was very good, and phone was in mint condition. Photo quality is awesome! This was one of my main reasons for purchasing this phone. I previously owned a Samsung S7. Some features have changed on the phone, for example the home button is no longer there, and has the Bixby feature which I am trying to figure out. Overall would highly recommend!
            "
"61","I read some disturbing reviews on here for this phone, but they seemed to be more for the sellers than the actual phone. I got my blue S9+ direct from Amazon and it was brand new & perfectly intact. It was insanely easy to transfer all of the info from my old phone and to have my service switched to the new phone. It's beautiful and a nice upgrade from my LG V20. The best part is that I bought it here for about $300 less than I would have with my carrier. Excellent buy, very happy!
            "
"62","After 3 months with this phone, I can conclude that this is a very solid Android phone. Jam-packed with features like stereo speakers, LED indicator, wireless charging, Face Unlock/Iris Scanner, fast fingerprint sensor with gesture controls, headphone jack (obviously), 1440p Super OLED display and plenty of others features. The cameras, while nowhere near the level of the Google Pixel 3, are still very strong on their own, producing quality photos, steady video, and surprisingly good portrait mode. Only downsides are that the battery drains a little faster expected, a dedicated Bixby button which can be really annoying if you press on accident, Samsung bloatware, and a very tacky AR Emoji. Coming from an lifelong IPhone user, I can confidently say that anyone who isn¡¯t too attached to the Apple Ecosystem will have an amazing experience. This is my first Android phone, and can say with confidence that Samsung successfully made me satisfied with my purchase.

"63","So different from previous models. Removed many of the options i need and loved.  Sad.I needed more internal memory. Almost left galaxy after many years due to curved infinity screen and silly edge. Bixby is useless.I was advised by many techs not to purchase this model.  I finally decided based on slo mo, avitar & more memory.iPhones are more sturdy & have better batteries but no micro sd card!When galaxy removes sd card i'll leave them for iPhone as I can no longer replace batteries in galaxy. Why galaxy? Praying battery lasts.Very complex phone with long learning curve. Too many options! Hate curved infinity screen, bixby & edge. Useless waste!64 gb memory is great so far. Once you buy alexa you need so much more internal memory.Not sure how long battery will last. Crossing my fingers since it can't be replaced.Why on earth did they use curved infinity screen? Very hard to find case and screen protectors that work.  Phone is so fragile.What is value and purpose  of ""bixby""? Also find ""edge""useless and unnecessary.Great stereo sound on movies.Still learning phone hidden tricks after many weeks! Learning curve takes forever.Will test with camera soon and get back to you. I loved the s4 and s5 cameras. Why less Mp now on this model?

"64","I've been an iPhone user for 12 years and this is my first Samsung so it's taking a little getting used to.  Ive been spoiled by having a phone that flawlessly synced with my Mac.  However I'm digging the extended battery life, the camera clarity, the screens resolution adjustability, the expandable memory  and things like that which have made the switch pleasant.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the price and the lack of USB audio play through car audio systems.  Even with Black Friday pricing the S9 isn't really competitive in the price department.  For unknown reasons Samsung did away with the simple plug and play USB audio.  There is a Mirror Link app on the phone for using USB audio only a few cars have that capability.

"65","This phone is supposed to be brand-new and unlocked. It looks brand-new, and so far, it is working fine, but the box was missing the SIM ejecting Needle and the beginners Manual. I had the SIM ejecting Needle and I downloaded the Users Manual from Samsung.com. After activating the phone with the TRACFONE carrier I got a message asking me to activate the phone with Spring.  There is a way to go around that issue, and you do not get the message anymore as long as the phone stays ON all the time, it is not a big deal. I contacted the seller through Amazon, and he offered me a refund, but I do not want to return it because the phone is great. I would like the problem fixed.

"67","I bought this for my dad to activate as a Verizon phone.  It is NOT the same phone you'd get at Verizon. He spent so much time calling Samsung and they told him this-This phone will not have the identical capabilities as what you'd buy at Verizon. Specifically, the video call feature with another Android, and will not using WiFi for calls if you don't have cell service. These are TWO big things that doesn't make sense to go without when you pay this much for a phone.  SO upset.

"68","Ordered the phone and noticed during setup that the phone didn't quite ""feel"" like a flagship phone should...I ended up googling how to tell if it was fake or not and found a video confirming it was....I started the return process I'll update when it's taken care ofEDIT: Still upset about the whole situation, but Amazon took care of return in a timely manner....So....there's that.

"69","I was an apple fan but since ios phones were getting so expensive every year I decided to give Samsung a try, which was a HUGE mistake. Dont get me wrong this is a nice looking phone the battery is great I can go one full day without charging it, heavy user. The screen resolution is awesome and the sound is great. But after 4 months my S9+ started to slow down and now it just doesn't respond at all.  the screen frequently freezes and and goes completely blank. I try to turn it on and off but it doesn't work and a message appears on my screen (I have attached a pic of the message).  I think I may go back to iOS.

"70","Exactly as advertised. Brand new US Unlocked model of the Galaxy S9 (SM-G960U1). Works perfectly with all the sums I've tried (AT&T &Verizon) get better service with Verizon in my area. Being the unlocked model it isn't full of carrier bloatware so if you don't have a use for those many of them can just be downloaded. Completely satisfied.Also believe this phone pick up different waves than the S8 I used to get 3 bars consistently in my area with the S8 and I've had 4 with this one since I set it up.
            "
"71","I was skeptical at first due to many other reviewers having issues with fake phones to not getting the unlocked phone to not getting it at all. However, I think the issue here however is that most people are buying it from other sellers unwittingly. For instance, in my 1st pic, it sets Liquid Deals as a default buyer and not amazon. Most would just click that buy now button and think everything is going to be okay and maybe it will. Who knows?  The product came with its original packaging and both the packaging and the phone was completely pristine. I added the phone to my Samsung account and it showed that I had a 1 year warranty from today as shown in the 2nd pic. The phone runs flawlessly for a last gen device and I'm glad that I made this upgrade from my s7 edge.  Despite the s9 having a larger screen than the s7 edge, I still found the s9 to be a little small in the hands compared to the s7 edge. If you're wanting the feel of the s7 edge in your hand, go for the s9+ or note 9.  As long as you buy directly from Amazon, you should receive the product brand new.

"72","This phone is absolutely fabulous!!  I switched from a Moto X Pure~ which I loved ~ so this is a huge upgrade.  It was so so easy to set up ~ there is an adapter included that you attach to your old phone and use an app to copy all of your files.  Awesome.  It is super fast and I love how customizable it is,  from themes to icons to fonts.  I haven't had any issues with Bixby.  Sound is awesome  and sound is a very important aspect to me.  The display is beautiful and camera is fabulous.  I am so concerned about breakage ~ I have MS and tend to twitch a lot and I drop things.  So I researched forever for a protective but pretty case and I hope I found it.  I also have a screen protector and a pop socket.  And I love the whole set up.  It now feels really secure in my hand.  The case did add a bit of weight but I don't mind.  I also worried about getting a fake phone or an empty box~ I purchased an unlocked phone and worried about that l.  Research your seller ~ I even emailed them and told them my concerns before I purchased mine.  I ended up getting mine from Endlessitems17 and highly recommend them.  Amazon didn't update the seller's stock before I already bought it.  They contacted me the same day,  offered me a black one, or a refund, or wait till they got one in.  I chose to wait rather than a refund cuz who knows how long that would take!  They weren't supposed to get any in for three days and that was Monday.  Customer service was awesome ~ said that they would try to find one quicker~ and I recieved my phone yesterday ~ Wednesday!  It came in perfect condition,  and was a breeze for Metro to get it up and running.  I am totally happy with this phone and recommend buying it!

"73","I bought this phone thinking that it would be better than my current S6 Edge - and just about in every way it is specially low light shots, but disappointed with the picture AI results in general.  I normally use my phone as a camera, less so as a computer or streaming device.Sure wide shots look indiscernible, but once you want to see some details the S9+ images become murky at 100% zoom as the Auto settings normally changes to F1.5 (no you cannot force it to use F2.4 in auto mode - which most users use)  Fonts looks blotchy upon closer inspection.  Yes I understand you can set it to Pro mode so you can do this, but most times I use my phone to take pictures within 3 secs, no time for fiddling with settings.The S6 has a 16M native resolution at 4x3, so setting it to 16x9 reduces resolution to 12M.The 9+ has a 12M native resolution at 4x3, so setting it to 16x9 reduces resolution to 9M.Quite possible this may be causing it, but I read the Pixel has the same resolution but takes better photos because of the AI implementation.I normally shoot at 16x9 size settings so it fills my monitor screen and FB uploads, and this is how I compared the shots.Aside from the uploaded picture, I have also compared outside scenes on both phones - and I do notice slightly murkier pictures with the S9+.In the DLSR world, sometimes you get bad lens so the logical thing is to replace the lens for a sharper one, but not everyone has this luxury with a phone specially if you are at a mobile carrier store with strict use limits.  I did a little research and found forums where people complain of the image quality as well, so I don't think I'm in the minority.
            "
"74","I was nervous about purchasing an unlocked phone from Amazon, not knowing what I'd get. But I purchased this, sold and fulfilled by Amazon, and have been very pleased with my S9.  I had to purchase a separate SIM card from my carrier, T-Mobile,  but that is true with any unlocked phone you buy.  This doesn't come with a wall or car charger but that is true for all S9's so you have to purchase these separately.  I've had earlier versions of Samsung phones and this is the best phone I've had in terms of screen clarity, memory speed, photo quality, audio and much more.  If you are considering buying this phone, your best best is to buy directly from Amazon as a seller, not a third party seller.  Otherwise, be sure to read the third party's terms carefully and be aware buying from a third party seller comes with risks.
            "
"75","This phone is leagues better than my S6 was, mostly due to refinement of the phone rather than innovation. It does everything you want it to, has a great camera, beautiful screen, and everything you've come to expect from a Samsung flagship.That said, it's not a massive improvement from the S8. It's more polished, but it is essentially the same phone.If your got a need to upgrade to a new device from a 3+ year old device, absolutely worth the investment. From a more modern phone, not so much.

"76","hi good day I purchased this phone an it giving problems its getting hot the apps are taking long to open it is constantly freezing
            "
"77","First let me say that the Galaxy S9+ is a big beautiful phone. The screen is outstanding, the speed is fast and it has more features than I ever probably learn to use. Definitely a first-class phone from Samsung.What I really want to say is: I purchased this Galaxy S9+ from the Amazon Warehouse at great price with an additional 20% discount. I was concerned about purchasing a Used-Like New phone but my son, who had previously worked at Amazon, said those phones were in new condition and a great buy. He was right.The phone was without a scratch and had a clean esn. It came in the original box ( a little beat up) with all the original accessories still wrapped up. Activation was no problem and it is working great. And it was half the price of a new phone! Half price for a Galaxy S9+! I am so happy and will recommend to my friends who are shopping for new phones to check out the Amazon warehouse deals.UPDATE: I am taking off one star because I cannot get insurance on phone. Amazon will not provide nor even offer insurance on own product. There are two insurance providers on Amazon, SquareTrade and Asurion, but neither will cover used Amazon phone. Interestingly, the both cover used eB*y phones but Amazon can't or won't get them to cover their used products. Go figure???

"78","I was concerned about ordering the unlocked s9 after reading several mixed reviews on whether or not this was compatible with Verizon and some people saying they recieved refurbished or defective phones.  After more research and a nice sale price I took a bit of a chance and pulled the trigger.  Glad I did.  Received the phone in perfectly new condition and no issues on Verizon network at all.  I just popped in my sim and it's worked perfectly since.  Coming from an S8, the S9 is almost identical....with some notable improvements.  But I'm not going to turn this into an S9 product review.  If you're looking here for an unlocked phone to purchase, you already know if you like the S9 or not.  Anyway, I got a good quality, new phone at a much better price than I could have got direct from V, BB, or most other stores (unless you want to lock yourself in with a carrier for two years).

"80","This phone was great the first two months I had it. After that, my screen, my apps, everything would started to freeze more often than usual. It just got to the point when I closed out, my entire phone went black and wouldn't let me back in the phone. This doesn't seem normal anymore and it hasn't fallen or anything. No sorts of damage or anything.  So I dont understand why its doing this. If you do, let me know. I spent almost $800 and that's a arm and leg for me.

"81","The speaker distorts really bad when the music is at high volume. The reason i bought this was for the camera and the new speakers. The camera's front flash when on whatsapp conversations does not work. If you need to send someone a picture, you have to go the the camera itself, take the picture then go back into whatsapp to send it. I mean its not a huge deal but i'd like if the front flash worked in whatsapp. All in all, good phone but mehhh!

"82","I was so nervous about getting this phone after reading some of the reviews, but I'm happy to say I've had it almost a month so far and still no complaints. I use verizon towers through straight talk and had no issue setting it up myself. It is all glass so I recommend a nice case and screen protector. The camera is amazing and the set up is really nice. I also loved that it didn't come with all the random apps that I never used on my old phones.
            "
"83","So if the phone worked I'd give it 4 or 5 stars but not being able to charge by wire is a very big bug apparently not too uncommon for this phone.  I can charge it wirelessly, I can connect the phone to my laptop and perform the Samsung Smart Switch backup process, but for some unknown reason it fails to charge through the USB port.  Service to Samsung has been above average but its outsourced overseas scripted help - this takes extra time spent try to explain the symptoms and get the desired support.  Naturally with a suspect hardware error I now have the undesirable task of shipping the phone to them, waiting for it to be repaired/replaced, and then waiting for the return,  From what I'm told that sounds like a two week turnaround.  This is a flagship phone.  Samsung is a big seller of these phones.  Support should be much stronger IMHO - such as accelerated return and repair for such a new phone.Battery life has been good, wifi and bluetooth have been solid and aren't draining my battery, screen look great, find the Bixby button to be in an annoying location often accidentally pressed and then more time wasted to cancel it.  Have had no system locks or unexpected reboots unlike my former platform.  Wish it did other things that the last phone did such as hands free txt while driving.  The email apps I've used thusfar leave desirable room for improvements such as the ability to place email folders at the home screen - less clicks to see stuff.

"84","I got this Phone on Black Friday with Fancy price. I was hoping this will be a good choice but I think I made bad choice.  Here are the reasons1. Phone Signal: The phone displays very bad signal with ATT provider. I thought it will be provider issue and talked to them. They said this model has issues.2. No WIFI Calling Option: This Model is not USA ATT Phone Variant so this is not compatible with WIFI Calling. WIFI calling helps when the Signal is almost No or very weak. We can connect to the WIFI and then use that to make calls. This is completely gone. I had NOTE-5 and it was having good signal and WIFI on same places.3. Calls dropping: Called the Provider and they said same. It is the model issue and not Sim card issue4. After all these hassles, called ATT and asked for replacement SIM and adding the replacement SIM did not help.These are all the reasons that I dont recommend this to others. I am also going to call Amazon and see what options do I have to return.

"85","Wow. After 3 days of using (without a single drop) I've noticed the camera's glass cover is cracked. Next day I am already having dust particles under it. Quick google and I see I am not the only one (there are many). I've noticed this last night after I left a warm building and on the outside it was pretty cold. The funny thing is that many other users with this problem noticed that the temperature difference might be the problem. And yeah, most of them have owned their samsung phones for only few days/weeks too. So it seems like if it doesn't happen to you in few weeks/months after buying then you are safe. I am extremely disappointed. I own old iphone SE, nexus 5 and iphone 4 where the last one is being used by my kid as a toy (!!) and non of these have broken either front glass or camera glass.

"86","I upgraded from an S6 so I'm pretty familiar with the S9 Plus although there are changes. Loved my S6 and love the S9 Plus although I don't like the larger size. The only issue with this order was that I received a BLACK S9 Plus, not coral blue. Not a big deal since it'll be in a case but if you have your heart set on a particular color, make sure that's what they're sending you.

"88","So far so good, phone isn't a clone as far as I can tell, so that's good. Came in pretty good condition, however the sim tool was loose and there are a few scratches near the top of the phone. There is also some weird white stuff on the ear piece that doesn't seem to wanna come off so I question if it's really a BRAND NEW phone. My only other issue is that for a full price phone, you would think all the accessories would be real. The headphones that come with it are a cheap Vietnam knock off of the akg headphones and don't even have the akg logo on them, and they sound very muffled, and feel really cheap. The adapter for the phone charger is real, however the charging cable isn't the original Samsung charging cable at all, barely even fits into the adapter (sticks out a bit). And there is no Samsung seal of approval in the box, so I can only assume someone opened it, took out what they wanted and replaced it with cheap knock offs of what should be in there, and forgot to put the seal back. If I didn't need this phone so bad I would send it back and request an entirely brand new device that is completely sealed and never been opened. But my old phone is a vegetable so I can't go back to it. Lastly on the possibility of a clone, the pictures that it takes look very....odd, like the quality is very low rez, again making me question if this is a ""really good"" clone. I don't recommend going through this seller by any means. <U+0001F44E><U+0001F44E>

"89","The Galaxy S9 was a replacement for an older generation Galaxy that could no longer hold all of the apps I use.  My smartphone use consists primarily of voice, text, search, and GPS guidance functions and an occasional photograph.  It also functions as an always available stand in for my Kindle. For me, the Galaxy S9 is the perfect combination of size, function, reliability and battery life.  I've wrapped it in an OtterBox Commuter case coupled with a MagGlass screen protector to help protect it against the inevitable drops and impacts it will experience over time.  It's menu system is simple and relatively intuitive although I'm sure I've missed some of its advanced functions since I haven't taken the time to download or read the full user manual. Overall, I couldn't be happier with the phone.

"90","I have been watching my ""non-apple"" friends for some time now... wondering, watching.  I bought a motoroloa cheapo phone just to check out the OS.  How did I like the Google options, the easiness of the apps, user interface?  LOVED it.So, I started to search for the ""Real Deal""  and I have been very impressed with the Galaxy S9+.  The screen is unbelievably crisp.  Camera?  Crazy good!Very happy with this phone, even happier it is unlocked so I can test the waters with different providers too.:)

"91","I AM SO ANGRY. I GOT A ""DUMMY"" PHONE IT DOES NOT EVEN WANT TO TURN ON AND THE BEST PART IS IT ISN'T EVEN A SAMSUNG S9.I BROUGHT THIS PHONE WITH ME TO AUSTRALIA AS A GIFT FOR MY DAD AND I AM FURIOUS ONLY TO OPEN THE BOX AND GET THIS PHONE. I WANT MY MONEY BACK.
            "
"92","Purely impressed!  An amazing piece of hardware from Samsung which - to me - excels in all things hardware related, and this is no exception.  There is not a single element of the hardware (screen, battery, size, ports, camera, hardware specifications, resilience, and so forth) that isn't outstanding on paper or in action.  The added customization, openness,  and versatility of the Android OS is welcomed compared to Apple's iOS.The added versatility of the unlocked version is nice if a carrier switch or something of that sort is possible, but may inhibit certain carrier exclusive features depending on the carrier (like digital voicemail).My only minor complaint is of all the Samsung apps, software, and features (bloatware?) that is crammed into the phone and semi-forces its use.  A lot it seems like more of sales pitch rather than adding any value.  *Cough*  The ""Bixby Button""...  *Cough*  I feel this is Samsung's weak-point with its mobile offerings at the moment.As an aside, this is my first Android phone, after having all iPhones.  I decided to switch to the Galaxy S9 and Android OS after not liking the direction Apple was going with its flagship phones. Plus, the cutting edge features combined with sensible design choices, such as a headphone jack and touch recognition, compelled me to ""switch-sides"".  6+ months later, at the time of this review, I'm still completely satisfied with my Galaxy S9.
            "
"93","Purchased the phone on Cyber Monday and all was great for the first like 3 weeks.  Then periodically the phone would stop charging, saying that there was water in the charging outlet when there wasn't.  After a while it just stopped charging entirely unless using a wireless charging port.  Mind you, we've had the phone for less than 2 months at this point.  Sent the phone into Samsung and they said the phone was out of warranty.  We specifically chose the phone option with a warranty, which cost more, for this reason.  Currently on the phone with Amazon and my partner's talking to Samsung to see what our options are, what a complete waste of time.
            "
"94","Best you can get from Samsung currently, comes with everything you would expect from a flagship: UHD AMOLED display, water and dust resistance, wireless charging, iris and fingerprint scanners, fast charging included in the box, headphone jack and a pair of nice AKG earbuds,microSD slot for expanded storage etc. Fast, snappy and stylish. Its Samsung's flagship phone and Iphone's main competition for a reason. the only ""bad thing"" I would say is that if you already have an S8 then the S9 is not worth the upgrade.
            "
"95","Now this phone would be the ideal phone for a younger person or ppl with small fingers and can see will. Since I¡¯m either the reason for the stars. I went from a iPhone 6 Plus to this and have wanted to busted it up every since. It¡¯s not the phones fault. It¡¯s mine because I can¡¯t see it well and my fingers are to big to text correctly. I¡¯m always hitting button I didn¡¯t mean to and have to erase and retype most of my text. Maybe should have went with the plus size. The volume is a little low for my hearing and I didn¡¯t think my hearing was bad. I find sometimes I have to hold it up to my ear to hear somethings. I don¡¯t know if it me or the phone. The battery life I have to charge it every night. I am not a person to stay on my phone all day. Just general text,Facebook and maybe play a game for a bit. There maybe things I can turn off to extend the battery which I have turned to YouTube for some advise but I still didn¡¯t find anything to help extend the battery. Overall, after being so excited with getting a chance to have one of these phones I am disappointed with it. I¡¯m 41 years old so I¡¯m not over the hill. I wish I could go back and buy the plus version. So on this one be your on judge.

"96","Puchased this phone on pre-order back in March and have been using it since the day I received it on Sprint. I was hesitant to purchase a phone outside of a Sprint store but it worked out well and there was only one hiccup in activating it. This phone does not come with a SIM, which apparently Sprint doesn't always carry in the store. After some searching a SIM was located and the associate switched my phones (S8 to S9) in about 10 minutes.
            "
"97","The box I received didn't have a phone in it. It seems that it has happened to other people who bought this product looking at other reviews. In the box I only had a cheap plastic phone case. There was no accessory in it or anything.
            "
"98","everything is great on this phone, but one thing. The touch! Apparently, it is a known issue that the s9 and s9plus have horrible touch sensitivity issues. You can't type two words without wanting to throw the phone across the room. And it is in every app. Even the screen pattern to unlock makes me want throw it down and cry. I hate this phone that I buy this year for black Friday, got it the next day and less than 3 weeks later, I want my money back. Wait or the 10 to come out.

"99","I used to buy cheaper moto g phones i'm glad I finally bought something decent. The display is impressive and the bar at the top it more appealing to the eye than the notch on the iphone Xr and XS or the pixel 3. Camera is really good to and takes some impressive shots. I get a full day out of the battery using a mix of maps, camera and streaming music (normally for most of the day). The inclusion of wired AKG head phones is nice and the headphone port means there is compatibility with a range or portable amplifiers. I don't get why this isn't on other phones as not having it really limits your choice in headphones or you have to have a DAC/amp comb. Sound quality is good I from the onboard DAC/amp but I don't know about driving and thing larger than in ears. Bixby is ok, I tend to use googles assistant if i need to. Having the sd card slot is nice and allows for easy upgrade of the storage and for me to easily pull images I want to work on using my mac from the phone with out having to mess around with bluetooth or file transfer.

"104","I am having issues with my unlocked S9 model SM-g960u.  The hardware I received is perfectly fine and in fact the S9 is probably the most beautiful phone I've ever laid eyes on and its a damn shame that I am going to be returning this one.  I bought mine from JD Electronics at an amazing price of 563$. HOWEVER, I would gladly have paid more for a phone with no issues.  I've received numerous error messages and quirks that lead me to believe this phone has been region locked or has an incompatible firmware.Software update: One of the first things I tried to do with this phone was downloading updates for it.  When you navigate to Settings > Software Update > Download updates manually | The phone displays ""registering device"" and then ""processing failed.""Samsung Pay: When I try to open it says ""Access to Smasung Pay has been denied. Unauthorized modifications have been made to your device"" This means somehow the ""Knox Counter"" has been tripped on this device, which supposedly detects when someone roots it.  The next time I tried to open it says Samsung Pay is not supported on this device.  A SAMSUNG!Region: After experiencing these quirks I went to Settings > About Phone | where i discovered the region is set to United Arab Emirates.  Why would that be? The product even said United State Warranty in the description?Bixby:  When I swipe left to Bixby Home, scrolling down to the news cards ""Newsroom"" ""youtube"" ""Yahoo"" etc... all display headlines in Chinese and take me to chinese websites.  The language is set to english in phone and bixby settings.Samsung +: after experiencing much slower youtube speeds over mobile data than my previous S7 active, I downloaded Samsung+ to do a speed test.  When I navigate to Samsung+ > Diagnostic tools > Connection Speed Test > Mobile > Start speed test | it says ""connected to AT&T LTE Network, displays a ping reading for a few seconds, then says ""Test Cancelled"".Samsung Smart Switch: Samsung Smart switch will not recognize my device, saying it is incompatible.All of theses quirks lead me to beleive something is seriously defective or incompatible about my version of this phone.  I can't download software updates. I can't connect to Smart Switch on PC.  I am having serious anxiety over this purchase and warn anyone from buying such an expensive item from a third party seller.  I put a return/refund request to JD Electronics and have not heard back from them yet.  Will update this if they contact me.

"106","Great screen, fast processor, beautiful phone.  Camera is amazing.  Must say, after 10+ years of being an iPhone fan, this S9 kicks my old iPhone's rear.  Love the functionality, smart design, and flexibility.  And almost half the price of an iPhone. Took me about two weeks to get used to Android, but it is so much more useful than mono-button. over-controlling iOS.  Great phone and great operating system.  I am a convert!

"109","I have had the phone for about 2 weeks now. For the most part, I love it. Huge upgrade and so much faster than my previous S5. However, I'm not a big fan of the curved edges. I was a little hesitant to purchase this due to reviews saying the phone was missing from the box, but I am glad I did. This was the cheapest unlocked S9 that I found.  Nothing was missing. This phone included the fast charge cable with block, ear buds with 3 sets of different size tips, sim card removal key, and a female USB A to a male USB C adapter to transfer data from your old phone to the new one. I will update this after I have had the phone longer but as of right now I'm a happy customer.

When they put the Sim card in it says ""phone not allowed"". I spent over an hour calling different numbers to figure out what was going on and the only nswer I got was that it must not be unlocked like it said it was. I called Amazon support and they researched it and said  that it's supposed to work with metroPCS, band they don't under why it isnt. Amazonis refunding my money but it still upsets me because I had my heart set on it.

"111","Bought this phone to replace an iPhone 7. Wife likes the phone but coming from the simplicity of the iOS, this is a little more complicated.

Carrier locked phones have already upgraded to the Pie and One UI updates but no word on when the unlocked phones will get theirs. Samsung need to step up their customer service game.

Amazon / samsung sent a replacement, Got the replacement and its been a nightmare to turn on with sprint, In the end sprint couldn't do it, This has been a nightmare and its taken up so much of my time and energy, Its stressed me out to no end. I will be canceling my amazon Prime and I am done with Amazon. The entire procedure for returns have been a joke and nobody was any help, Also Sprint & Samsung have been horrible, Avoid that one aswell. The phone claims to be unlocked, it is not. Samsung and amazon were no help what so ever. I got different answers from everyone every time I contacted them. Stay away from this phone and do not buy cell phones on Amazon.

"114","Beautiful phone, a smooth operator. Fast, slick (literally and figuratively), a fantastically marvelous piece of tech.I have returned this phone because there is this wretched little Bixby button directly OPPOSITE the POWER button, where by squeezing the POWER, I invariably re-activate Bixby, which was disabled per intructions.It could have been such a great phone.Yes, technically I can disable the button IF I sign up for a Samsung account so that I can change the settings in Bixby. Sorry, Samsung, I don't want my phone activities reporting to your mothership.

"117","If you are on the fence about what you want in a phone, I highly recommend Samsung brand, but also specifically either this phone, or the Samsung S9+.  My mom got this phone after years of using a S4 and her transition was very smooth.  Although this phone has a lot of bangs and whistles, I think she has gotten used to using it far faster than we thought she would.  She is taking and sending pictures a lot more than she ever has before, and has even figured out how to use some of the other basic functions that she would not have used before.  She is very happy with her purchase, and would recommend this product.  Samsung has done a wonderful job with developing their product.  I personally have the + and I think the only real difference, is screen size.  Either way, you will be happy with this!

"118","I have had this phone for a few months now ,and I love it. I recently switched from an iphone 6 to this phone so that I would have better picture quality. I did not want to break the bank buying an iphone X, so I found this phone for an amazing price instead. Even though this phone is a Verizon wireless phone, I was able to use it with my AT&T plan. I am very impressed with the battery life! The only thing that sucks about an android is I cannot text through WiFi when I don't have have cell signal like I could with my iphone. I would buy from this seller again.

            "
"124","The phone arrive when expected. It was brand new. I took my sim card out of my old phone and put it into this one. Worked like a charm. Imediately switched the phone to verizon. I then proceeded to transfer everything on my old phone to new phone by USB. it came with an adapter. It was easy and took much less time than it had indicated. The camera is the bomb. A lot of options. Most are pretty intuitive. One has a slider that allows you to make the background blurrier or clearer. I plan to read the manual on the others. The only think I am having trouble with is the brightness switching from inside to outside lighting. I thought I set it to adjust automatically but I have had to change it manually everytime I go outside. Again hopefully the manual with have an adjustment that works. The phone is very attractive. I choose the blue one. It is not as light as it looks in the pictures but still very nice. So far the switch was easy and the pictures are great. The price was awesome. Very happy with my purchase. I am telling all my friends.

"125","I ordered two of the galaxy s9+ phones at 256gb. When they arrived, they were the wrong ones at 128gb. This is something to be mindful of before you activate it with a carrier. I use my own straight talk. Even though they were the wrong phones, I decided to keep them anyway just because I already went through the process of switching it over to straight talk. The phones work great and I am happy for that. Not happy that they are not the 256gb like I paid for.

"126","This phone continues to blow me away even after having it a couple days. Not only does it have fingerprint and eye recognition, it has a heart rate monitor! The phone is amazingly fast and gets great signal reception, let's not mention the camera. Slow motion is all I'll say.I hope it lasts 5 years like my Galaxy Mega before it did.Contrary to some of the reviews I did receive a brand new one, sealed in the box. I had zero issues getting it put into service, the girl at the cell phone store was thrilled it was so easy as well.The headphones (earbuds) that came with it are just awesome as well, kind of like having giant speakers on your head sound quality.I couldn't be much happier with the phone, it's a great device.
            "
"127","There are other reviewers who know a lot more about the technical aspects of the phone. I can say that my experience has been positive. I previously owned a Samsung Galaxy S5, so this was a significant upgrade for me. I love the look and feel of the phone. It's fast and responsive. I no longer feel like I have to delete every unnecessary app to keep the phone from freezing up and crashing. The battery lasts all day without charging (I used to have to charge multiple times with my S5 and if I was using heavily, I was tethered to power constantly or it would die). I am satisfied with the sound quality. I listen to a lot of music and podcasts. Anyone who has used Samsung phones in the past should have no problem adapting to this phone.I love the finger print and face recognition to unlock the phone and various apps. I also used the Samsung Pay feature for the first time today and that was fun and easy.  I do wish that I could get the home screens to wrap the way they did on my old phone, but that's the only thing I can think of that my S5 had that I can't do on this phone (and it's very minor).

            "
"130","I do not recommend getting this, or ANY Samsung device due to the sheer amount of crapware they install. It is impossible to remove this, without significantly changing the structure of the operating system.A few examples include: Galaxy Themes, requiring a Samsung account, remapping the Samsung Voice assistant (Bixby) is extremely difficult, and breaks between updates.One positive is DeX. Samsung's Desktop EXpericence is actually really cool.In conclusion, this is a very nice piece of hardware made very annoying by all of Samsung's attempts to ""improve"" on stock Android functionality. I will never made the mistake of buying another Samsung device again.

"131","I like the fact that this factory unlocked Galaxy S6 plus phone is not dedicated to any one carrier. You do not get the non removable junk they install. It fired up immediately and has worked well since. One problem I noticed is that after 48 hours if the unit is operating 24/7, I need to restart it due to clutter. Even when I close all applications after use.Get this one. It is excellent.
            "
"132","This came brand new completely wrapped in plastic down to the sides of the phone.  The people complaining about it being used clearly bought from a 3rd party seller. I bought from Amazon and it was definitely the unlocked model that works on cdma and gsm.  My wife loves her new phone and the new one ui made it easier to switch from apple. It came with all accessories also wrapped.

"133","Wow, this is a great phone! Very fast with excellent graphics. Comes with some wonderful toys. Some bloatware as well, but the apps are easy to get rid of. I love the fingerprint reader and some of the other security features. And for me it's the perfect size. Even with a cover it fits in my pocket and you don't have to squint to read texts. All in all, I could not recommend it more!

"134","I already had a Samsung galaxy 9 plus, but I shattered the screen. I knew I still needed to make payments on it and didn't want to pay the full amount for another phone. I wasn't happy I had to buy used, but let me tell you when I got this in.... I'll never buy new again unless it beats a certified refurbished price from Amazon! I can not believe how new it felt when I opened the box. It even had the liquid protector on! Which is my only negative comment, I had a liquid on my old one when it shattered so I prefer glass so I did order that when I ordered the new one, but a protector wasn't even expected! Fast delivery, exceeded my expectations!

"135","A year ago, I went with a Moto G5 Plus with Amazon's special offers. That phone was great. Excellent battery life, and an almost stock version of Android. Only downside was the cheap glass screen which cracked not even a month after I had it, and the mediocre pic quality. This time around, Amazon had a deal with the S9 and a free Echo Show (which I was able to hock on ebay). I was expecting leaps and bounds vs my old Moto. However I've been  somewhat disappointed. 1. The battery life sucks on this phone! I find myself having to throw it on a charger otherwise it will barely make it through a full day. 2. The fingerprint scanner is garbage compared to the Moto. I personally prefer the scanner on the front, but the S9 seems to have a delay that can be frustratingly annoying after a while. And yes I've taken multiple scans and re-scans of my prints. It does take nice pictures, and I love wireless charging and the secure folder feature. Other than that, I'm still on the fence. I may just send this one back to Amazon and order a g6.
            "
"136","The Bixby button is a joke. Worst cell phone feature ever.  If it weren't for the awful button, I might have given Bixby a try.  I mean really, who wants or needs a button dedicated to opening a virtual assistant!?!?  No one that's who.  The button should have been for the camera.Aside from that, great phone.  All functions work well and are generally intuitive.Update: latest update allows you repurpose the bixby button, making it slightly less worthless. Downside is that it forces you to keep bixby enabled.  One press let's you open an app of your choice (such as the camera app), two presses opens Bixby.
            "
"137","I ordered the Samsung Galaxy S9 Unlocked Smartphone for my wife, she simply loves it.  It has so many smart features and all the technology you come to expect in a ""Smart Phone.""  It takes great pictures and with 64GB you can download countless, pics, contacts, etc.
            "
"138","So excited! I received the phone today and it is amazing. It was very easy to set up. It has many new features (I had a Samsung7 and liked it) and the typing is more comfortable, because the screen is larger.I use Verizon, called them and they switched me in a short time to the new phone without a visit to the store. I put it on the charging stand I had for the S7, no problem. So far I am very happy with my choice.One week later: I love my new phone! Still discovering new features. As a former Photographer, I am afraid that the Photo Industry will take an other hit (film to digital) by the quality of the Camera on this phone. Excellent in every way!
            "
"139","When I first bought this phone, I was a little perturbed. I bought it when it was first released, and there was an issue either with the OS or Spotify that ate memory, causing me to have to reboot it every night. There has since been a software update which fixed the issue (issue was fixed after a Samsung update, not a Spotify update, so I think it was them), and now the phone is great.Amazing memory. No need to clear out old apps or photos or videos. Runs fast with no issues. And even if you did start to have a problem, there's a built in system optimizer so you don't have to download an app that's actually going to make it worse.The only issue I have is with the ""Edge"" feature. It does not integrate well with a lot of social media, so some pictures (ex Instagram stories) are cut off on the sides.

"140","The true color of this device (Coral Blue) isn't well represented in cook position to real life. The phone is soooooo much richer in color. The device isn't too long and fits decently in my hand. Android got a real big overhaul from what I remember years ago since my S4 and S2. It doesn't seem to be a real sacrifice switching from an iPhone 6s. Bixby button down he do much for me so I disabled it within a week. Only things I would like like to see is a texture back bverson of these devices...yes there are skins to apply but having an alternative would be nice...

"141","This phone is great. Not cheap,but a bad pick for me. I did not need this much phone. All these features I probably never use. I also have a Samsung tv and I must say it was easy doing the screen mirroring thing. Netflix from my phone to tv. So the phones great and I give it five stars, but being new to smart phones I bought more phone than I need and would not buy it again.

"142","Got this on sale for a good deal and I am impressed with the sound quality, the camera, pretty much everything. I was replacing an S5 so I was a bit behind on the phones. It was easy to set up, I just had to visit my Verizon store and buy a SIM card because the S5 wouldn't work. It was around $10 bucks. Comes with headphones and a handy device that lets you port all of your stuff from your old phone, into the new one. Overall, I am satisfied with this phone, hopefully it lasts me as long as the S5 did!

"143","The Galaxy S8 Plus battery was great, this feels like a major step backward, as I needed to charge the phone at least 3 times just to get through 8-5.There are also major software problems too: the VPN simply refused to function after switched from Wi-Fi to cellular, requiring manual disconnect and reconnect to the VPN. My office has several Wi-Fi dead spots, as you can see it can get frustrating very quickly. Samsung support is virtually useless, they kept on saying it is not a problem.Now the good: camera is phenomenal, the best out there; performance is light years ahead of the S8, I don't even see the stuttering in the Google Play Store, that's how smooth the phone is.Overall, solid phone hindered by poor battery life and my personal issue with VPN according to Samsung, so I decided to deal with it as a customer who has an issue with the product: returning it. Guess I would use the S8 one more year.

"144","This was on sale more than $100 off for Black Friday weekend, so it was a no-brainer to get the unlocked phone from Amazon with prime shipping (it arrived less than 36 hours after ordering it) rather than from Samsung's website for the same price and slower (not free) shipping. I love the phone and desperately needed a new one. The phone is fantastic and super fast. I love it.

"146","I got my unlocked Samsung Galaxy S9, it works with cricket wireless! Just plugged in my sim card and it works perfectly. Very happy with my purchase. I purchased this phone with Amazon, I was thinking about purchasing it with a third party seller because it's cheaper, however I didn't feel like risking anything so I chose not to. So far I love the phone!

"147","In rare Amazon fashion, this multiple-hundred dollar item was shipped with ZERO packaging to protect the phone box. Pretty disappointing, fortunately everything with the phone was fine. But if I order something that is several hundred dollars, I expect there to be at least a degree of packaging - not just loose in the big cardboard box.The phone itself is outstanding! I went from a Galaxy S4 to an S9. I had my old one 6 years I loved it so much, but I'm glad I finally upgraded.
            "
"148","Wow, what a huge step up from my Galaxy S7 Edge. All day battery, even with hours of screen time. Apps load quickly and run smoothly. Firefox loads web pages quickly.The camera opens quickly, and takes picture quickly. My old S7 would sometimes take several tries to open the camera and then take up to 10-15 seconds before it was ready to take a picture and longer for a video.Pictures are definitly much better than my old S7 Edge.All in all a nice upgrade.
            "
"149","After reading all the ""single starred"" reviews I was getting worried about my purchase. As soon as it booted up though, all my doubts vanished! The phone is so much more better than my old phone! I was using a BLU phone with only 8gbs of internal storage and really wanted an upgrade. And what an upgrade it was! The camera quality is splendid, the performance is remarkable, and the transition was smooth as silk. The battery life is hindered due to the always on function and the already implanted apps that run among Samsung's internal storage,but it doesn't bother me that much. I'm still learning of it's many capabilities, but all in all I'm not disappointed with it yet.

"150","After launching my Pixel 2 XL out of the passenger window in a fit of rage, I needed a new phone. I guess I didn't feel like rating the ""Waze"" app with 5 stars in heavy traffic. Anyways... I didn't really have too many requirements, the new phone needed a great camera and a display that wasn't smashed into 1349 pieces.This S9+ will be a hard phone to replace. The display is deep. The camera is arguably the best on the current market. Even Bixby can be disabled. It's not perfect but it's my daily driver for the moment.
            "
"151","I have not had many issues with this phone thus far. I always keep it in battery saver mode which can be frustrating for lack of certain notifications, but it seems to be fast, the size isn't too big for me, although one handed operation is limited compared to the smaller phone. Charge lasts all day without much use without power saver mode. Add a fair amount of use and power saver mode and still lasts all day.I couldn't justify getting a GS9 over a GS9+ because the battery life is better, 2 cameras, and an extra 2 GB of ram over the other device. I like this one for these extra features. Samsung made a quality phone, and I am happy to own it. I'd recommend charging the battery up to 85%, and keeping it above 35%, which may double your battery life (maintian 95% capacity after 4 years instead of samsung's 2 year guarantee)
            "
"152","My previous Samsung Galaxy was the S7.  After a couple of years the battery life was becoming a problem so I decided to buy the S9.  The S9 appears to be another quality phone.  The camera and processing speed is noticeably better.  The only thing I'm not thrilled with is the curved screen edges.  I don't understand why they think people want something like that.  The curves are distracting and I hope in the future, Samsung goes back to a completely flat screen.  I also hope that Samsung can break away from the goons at Facebook and allow people to completely delete  the Facebook app which seems to have a permanent presence.  I want to be able to delete stupid apps like Facebook completely if I don't use them.

"153","I decided to buy a warehouse deal due to the price.  I can't even tell it was ""very good"" condition.  Looks brand new.  Works perfectly.  Battery life great.  Picture quality is stunning.  I can't find one complaint at all.

"154","I took a long time choosing a phone; they cost so much now & I plan to keep this one for a long time. I also want to change service providers with my own phone. I really liked this Galaxy S9, but every time I read a negative review about S9s or S8s I had to chase down information proving or disproving it. I didn't know if I could afford an S9.  When I was ready, I chose this S9 in Orchid - I'd been watching it daily. The camera is as great as reviews everywhere say it is, and there are so many upgrades since my old S5 came out! I registered my new phone on Samsung.com  and it doesn't affect anything that I purchased my Unlocked phone from Samsung, not from a service provider. There are many misconceptions among the reviews and comments. It does use WiFi - for the web & for making phone calls. I saved money buying on Amazon. I couldn't have bought an S9 anywhere else. The seller was really great about responding to any questions I had; I'm glad I purchased my phone from them. This has been a really great purchase experience!

"155","Long story short.Wanted an unlocked phone just so i can switch carriers whenever i felt like it.I have sprint.Put in my sim card and was told that this phone would not work on sprint network....Called up sprint and also went to a sprint store,was told phone is locked and they could not activate it....My kid need's a new phone so i sent it to him( he has at&t).He was told that they could not port his number over to that phone(but they were able to give it a new number if he wanted to add a line)......so basically what he did was trade it in to at&t plus $200.00 and got a note 9 instead.........I think both companies did not want to activate a phone that was not purchased from them.

"156","I read a few horrible reviews about not getting a new phone, and for the amount of money involved I was nervous but very happy when I opened the box to find a shiny new phone with all the parts it is supposed to come with.  It was an easy install switching contacts and apps from old phone was a  breeze and even easier installing SIM card from old phone to new worked like a charm.  I am very happy with this purchase!  I can't wait to start using it and learning all the cool features!!

"157","Liked the discounted price during holiday pricing. Phone is great, fast, cameras are good enough. Feels good in hand, screen is perfect size, sound is great for a phone device. Coming from Galaxy note 3 for which I paid 150 brand new. This is huge upgrade but still not worth 5 times higher price than what phones  used to  cost. Phone manufacturers have to understand that. Please stop overpaying for phones and make them to lower prices. It's not normal that cell phone costs 1000, PERIOD
            "
"158","I can't believe how good the quality of this phone is. I checked the screen and the body it's almost like new and works perfectly; just as described in the listing. I tested all functions and so far so good; is a replacement my mom's Note 5.As for the accessories, it came with the original fast charger, the USB to C connector.The AKG earbuds are...sigh, no good; missing the soft bud cushions so can't wear them at all. Didn't come with the sim slot opener.The box was sealed with tab and a label sticker showing it's Amazon Warehouse certified.I will update this post if something is up with the phone.

"159","Still don't know how to use everything.  But screen is good, clarity of sound.  Good pics and easy video.  But I haven't figured out all the settings and really get annoyed because it is far to easy to trip the selfie setting and often miss shots because I accidentally touched something.  Also need to figure out the telephoto, it works great when I accidentally use it : )

"160","I bought this phone and I am traveling internationally. The phone says unlocked, but when I tried to use the phone with a India SIM card, it didnt work. When I called Samsung Customer service, they say that this version is US only. There is something called Region lock and I am still struggling to figure out how to make it work in India. I am really frustrated spending so much a phone and doesnt work.
            "
"161","Before I ordered this, I read a LOT of the reviews. And after reading some horror stories (about people not receiving new phones or the box being empty) I was actually really worried something like that would happen to me too. I contacted the seller but never heard back from them (MizMaz), which did not help with my anxiety while I waited for the package.When I opened the box, the front screen protector film showed some fingerprints and there was no protector for the back of the phone. Otherwise the phone looked clean, and all of the extra things like charger were in the box. It has been working fine with T-Mobile, so that's great news, all we did was insert the SIM and that was it. Overall, if you are looking for a new phone but don't want to pay $1000+ for Galaxy S10, I think this is a great option. Will update the review if we encounter any problems in the future.
            "
"162","Can't believe I'm saying this, but I like my Huawei Mate 9 so much more than the S9+ that I actually returned it to Amazon.  On the Mate 9 the Battery life per charge is better, it charges faster, the stock interface is much better, the fingerprint reader is WAAAAAAAY better on the Mate 9. It almost never fails, can't claim that on the S9+.  And if felt like the ""larger"" screen on the S9+ was smaller and more constrained than the Mate 9.  Unless Huawei security concerns are proven, I'm sticking with them. They make a heck of a product.  Their US based customer service s<U+016F>ck<U+0161> big time.... But their products are solid.

"163","I may not have owned this phone for very long (I accidentally bought the Snapdragon version when what I really needed was the Exynos version) but the time I did own this phone was all I need to know how amazing it was. The size of the screen is just stunning, it just absolutely dwarfed my Samsung Galaxy S5. It's so light and easy to hold onto, that at no time did I ever worry about dropping it. Plus, there are plenty of phone cases you can buy right here on Amazon if you're worried. It's got plenty of memory, with the option to add a microSD card of up to 400GB to the phone to boost what it already has. The camera is just incredible, I was able to take pictures of my cat as well as wild squirrels and a few deer with quality like never before. Also, the customer service that Super Savings provides just goes above and beyond and then some. When they found out I had made a mistake with my purchase my offered me a full refund in a timely manner. They didn't get angry with me or try to embarrass me or anything of the sort, they were extremely cordial and helpful. I look forward to doing business with them in the future.

"164","While trolling apple for their phones, Samsung should keep in mind that their so called flagship s9+ starts malfunctioning barely after hitting a 30-day mark. I didn't waste $800+ money to buy a faulty product like this. Would never ever recommend to anyone

"166","Samsung has removed the built in android transfer option. Setting up this phone and transferring your data and settings is infuriating. Considering returning the phone as this is arduous. The promises from samsung that their smart switch application will work with any android 4.1 or later phone is plainly false as the application is incompatable with my android 7.0 phone.Bixby is an annoyance that should be completely removed; google assistant already does a better job.Overall, this phone is nothing but an infuriating attempt for samsung to enforce brand loyalty by making ti painful to move to or from a galaxy device.

But I am assuming these were all purchased from other sellers or refurbished or used. Amazon has all reviews from different sellers lumped into one. Got mine new from Amazon.com Services Inc. seller and it came with everything, including fast charger box and cable and headphones. Phone has been working excellent, great battery life.

"171","Ordered this unlocked Galaxy S9+ on Cyber Monday.  Got it for under $500.  Read a lot of the reviews on here and many said they got used phones or they weren't unlocked.  I took a chance and bought one anyways since I knew I could return it if it wasn't new or unlocked.  I couldn't pass it up for under $500.  Mine arrived and it was brand new and unlocked!  I took my Verizon sim card out of my S7 Edge and put it in the S9+ and powered it up and the phone had to do a quick download from Verizon and another reboot and then the phone was up and running.  I really notice the speed difference with the extra 2GB of RAM vs. the S7.  Hope this helps with anyone considering purchasing these unlocked phones and Happy Holidays!

"183","Previously my phone was a Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime. I upgraded to the s9+ after about 4 years of use with the grand prime. This upgrade was worth it. My provider (Cricket Wireless) works with it and the picture, camera, and sound quality is phenomenal!! The best things that I like about it include the fingerprint scanner, the ability to shoot 4k video (limited to 5 minutes though), as well as the extensive amount of tools that can be utilized such as their network settings, the integration with google and samsung, and paired with a good screen protector and case, the durability. The only downside I could say is the battery through continuous usage. However at a decent set brightness, the phone can last almost at a full 24 hours using the optimized battery usage setting.

"186","The fingerprint reader does not work sometimes if your hands are sweaty or wet, but otherwise works great. Battery lasts hours if you change the settings to make it last. Very large screen that makes working with the phone much easier. Only downside that I have noticed is that occasionally I have to restart the phone because it begins to run very slow. This is not a big deal but if it starts to do this while youre using google maps it can be quite annoying. The phone runs great otherwise and will handle any task that i have thrown at it.

"187","Phone is great, camera is great, it is also good looking.  Nevertheless, Bluetooth does not work with my car (VW Tiguan 2014) and apparently that is the case with many more car brands. You can check that yourself by visiting Samsung's support site and looking at the countless cases relating the same issue, across a variety of car brands and models. I owned an S7 that had the same issue, and was hoping that the S9 would have addressed that. I also owned an Iphone 7, that had flawless bluetooth performance. So, this is specific to Samsung issue. Samsung does not seem to care too much, since all those cases are poorly answered... with no solution. And remember: this has been going on since S7 (at least).. Samsung couldn't care less. Unfortunately I'm selling it and getting an Iphone instead. Too bad

I'm giving another 3rd party a chance,and honestly I'm not really optimistic .  Amazon provided me a courtesy credit which was nice; however, there's no real way of knowing if the seller is blacklisted.

"192","I've had it for 7 months now and I must say it keeps up to my everyday life. Battery life depends on how u use it but mines typically last me for daylight and it charges in no time. From 0-100 in about 1 hour and 50 minutes the most. If you don't use your phone while it charges. Seeing that the battery only lasts me for the daylight I now think the s9+ is a better buy for me because of the 500mAh more of battery life...

"204","I just received my phone and I ordered an unlocked one that should be the G965U1 model but I received a G965F/DS model and I'm so frustrated about it!! It doesn't work with Verizon Network and the charger doesn't fit in US power plugin!!
            "
"205","I'm not really into always buying the latest and greatest tech, which is why I bought the S9 at a decent discount as the S10 has been recently released.  I replaced my S6 active with this S9 and I am very impressed.  The S9 performs well with daily task.  With 1 charge, I usually have around 30% battery at the end of the day with moderate use.  I've had the S9 for about 3 month now with 0 issues and I dont regret my purchase.
            "
"206","I ordered the Coral Blue color for the S9 phone. The item picture here shows a light blue shade however what I received is much deeper blue and hard to tell if it's blue or black unless you see it in bright light. Not happy with the color I received but otherwise a great phone especially at the discounted price I got.
            "
"207","I ordered Samsung Galaxy s9 plus unlocked and none of the SIM cards worked. I'm assuming it's locked. I don't know if it's just a mistake or they mean to trick people
            "
"208","Well I just received it today and everything was in the original box with all documentation. All accessories we're new in the box and well so far so good!!! It's a Verizon phone I just called my provider Metro PCS and they switched it over and it only took about 5 mins and it was up and running! The phone is beautiful and man I can't wait to figure it all out the resolution is insanely clear.
            "
"209","Good price for Amazon prime users. Also TV is great. One thing, BUY A GOOD PROTECTOR !! Also buy as much memory as possible so as too send photos too. Fast phone and lots of apps. Dont pay for iPhone, the $$$$$ is too high. Great pics and Amazon app to send pics to computer is a great addition. As a old fart it took me time to look at all the apps. Oh, get a good security program too. Well worth the $$ for Amazon prime members, mine was un-locked. Just a footnote, most ISP will have free downloads for security programs, YES, for the phone also
            "
"210","I like the screen like everyone else does and also the music sounds good. Battery life is surprising good better than expected. But beware that you lose some options from from your service provider buying an unlocked phone. Also a bit too pricey but if you can afford it go for it...
            "
"211","i got a fake phone
            "
"212","Unlocked US version, as per description.  Works flawlessly with Mint.  Battery is long-lasting, fingerprint reader is great (works well even through a thick case, can be used to secure investing and banking apps), phone is fast, good storage, has a microSD slot.I would've loved an unlocked bootloader and replaceable battery, but most folks don't care about that so I'll give it 5 stars.
            "
"213","I'm in love with this phone. I was really hesitating between this Samsung that had amazing reviews or (yet again) buy a new iPhone. I used to think iPhones were the best smartphones on the market. Well, I'm happy to say I was proved wrong. This phone is really impressive, it works really smoothly and has an amazing camera, even for rookies like me. Don't regret the change from iPhone!
            "
"214","The Galaxy S9 arrived in perfect condition, with all included accessories (purchased from Sales Pro 55). The phone itself is beautifully designed. The glass on the back is prone to fingerprints and not grippy at all, so a case is recommended. The fast charging works flawlessly and does make up for the slightly smaller battery on the S9 model (in comparison to the S9+). The performance is fast and snappy, and with Samsung releasing One UI in January, I'm anticipating continued fast performance in 2019. Overall, I would recommend this phone, but please be cautious of third-party sellers. Look at ratings before picking one.
            "
"215","I was nervous buying this from an Amazon seller but now that I have had the phone a few days I am very pleased.Battery got hot the first charge but has been fine ever since. Accubattery App shows that the battery is working well. Beautiful design, vivid color and for less than you would get it from Verizon, anywhere else. Especially if you have Prime!!
            "
"216","I bought this S9+ last april and I have spent a month trying to reach customer support via amazon and no luck. The screen is burnt in and I read online that this is a common issue with the phone, and warranty applies. I hope by this mean I can be reached by a customer support representative since Amazon is not so helpful in this opportunity.
            "
"217","My old S5 died so I finally broke down and got a new and holy cow, this difference is huge. The phone is wonderful. Looks good and is sleek. All the new features are great. The camera is AMAZING. I can't tell you how much I love it, Definitely worth it
            "
"218","I was considering the Iphone X - but after reading the pros and cons of each phone on *reputable* websites, I went with this *Awesome*  Unlocked Samsung Galaxy S9+  It is super fast and exceeds all of my expectations and no Verizon bloatware! The camera and iris scanner work incredibly well!
            "
"219","It is an awesome one!!!!! Now able to use it more easy yeah. The battery is lasting me much longer, if I do not use it all the time, I do not need to charge it until the the next. Is is easy to set it up and get all your data back on.
            "
"220","Came perfect, well shipped and in original manufacturers packaging. I just had to take the sim card from my previous (Windows) phone and insert it into the S9+ holder. Configuration was very easy, I was new to this but I was 100% successful.
            "
"221","Samsung ""as always"" takes you above and beyond, I'm impressed with the quality of the phone and the many services that are designed to make you feel comfortable and connected. As for Bixby, I like Google assistant more, but it is good to have both services in one phone. I'm planning to leave the US and I'm not sure that the phone would be OK or locked for US providers only.
            "
"222","The box came with seemingly everything except the phone. This is a ton of money to spend to find out this is a scam.
            "
"223","I upgraded from a Galaxy S7 and this phone has been so much better. The battery life is definitely something to brag about here. I use this phone pretty heavily during the day and it lasts for a very decent amount of time. The fingerprint reader definitely one-upped its grandfather the S7 as it appears to authenticate much faster. The camera has really impressed me after the upgrade. The IP68 protection has definitely been taken advantage of when I want to have music playing in the shower. It¡¯s nice not to have to worry about your phone getting damaged when you get splashed.In the case of most cell providers, you¡¯re better off buying unlocked, as cell companies tend to jack the price up on this particular phone. If you¡¯re upgrading, you can just put your old SIM card in and set up the phone with no issues.
            "
"224","Bought just after price drop.  Phone worked great, new in box as advertised.  No issues as some have claimed about returned/open box items.  Can't beat the features for the price either.
            "
"225","I've seen various reviews before buying saying that they received only the phone w/nothing else on the box so when I ordered mine i was kind of scared to only receive the phone but I read to make sure what was in the box and it included everything the phone came w/ and I am now typing this on the new phone. I got everything and you should too. Great phone and its performance is amazing.
            "
"226","I purchased the ""New Condition"" Phone and it came in very mint condition and in its original Samsung box with all its accessories (i.e. AKG Ear buds, USB cord, USB connector, wall charger, SIM card ejector pin, instructions and manual). I am very satisfied with my purchase and I plan on purchasing another as a gift.
            "
"227","Great phone. Upgraded from S5 and this is much better. I like the wireless charging and it has a long battery life. Much faster CPU and memory. Very responsive. More storage and sd card can be added as well. More comfortable in the hand and easier to use. Highly recommend if you have a S5,6, or maybe 7. If anything newer, you should probably get the S10.
            "
"228","I got the regular S9 with 128gb. The screen is curved and it is real fun to watch to videos on phone. The sound quality is amazing. Its powerful enough like some of the portable speakers. Beats iphone any day. Camera is fabulous. Pictures are crystal clear and true HD.Some drawbacks - Pictures take lot of storage space. I installed a sd card. But its wierd - sometimes the pictures go to card and sometimes on phone. Very random.  Another point to be noted is that since it is curved screen so you have to be very careful in selecting the cover/case else you will crack the screen on first fall.Otherwise, the phone is slim and sleek. Real stylish.
            "
"229","This phone is great! Very easy to use and figure out where to find the settings. It was very easy to activate with my Verizon SIM card and isn't loaded with all those useless apps that ""locked"" phones come with.
            "
"230","The phone is good and all but I think its refurbished.  There was no samsung deal on the box just regular scotch tape .
            "
"231","I was hesitant to order after seeing all the negative reviews but everything is good. Phone arrived new and sealed in box. Inserted my Xfinity mobile sim and it was up and running. Transferred all of my old info from old phone using the Samsung Switch app. If I had any complaints it would be battery life. Not the worst but not the best. I ordered 2 wireless chargers so the phone can easily be charged at home or on my desk at work. Speaker phone quality is fantastic. Camera is one of the better ones I've used. Overall very satisfied with it.
            "
"232","Upgraded from my s7 edge to this its a little bit smaller than my previous and the battery doesnt last as long. I kinda prefer the convenience of actually having a home button but I'll just have to get use to it.
            "
"233","Phone seems to work perfectly fine although amazon didnt put any bubble wrap in the box so there was nothing keeping it from getting slammed around im lucky it wasnt damaged love the fast unlock with finger print sensor samsungs website doesnt recognize the IMEI to register though nor did metro pcs's website for activating it had to call customer service to get it to go through
            "
"234","Phone appears as though it would be everything the description says. Came set to a foreign language, so setting it to my preferred language proved difficult. After the most amazing Amazon rep helped answer a few questions, it was determined to be a locked Korean phone that is not compatible with any US networks. It only has 6 gigs. Two gigs are reserved for the operating system. Prompt claims that the phone is Verizon. It's definitely not.
            "
"235","Bought this phone.  Love it so far.  However after getting Verizon service and loading and transferring data from my old phone to the Galaxy S9+ the phone started getting really hot pretty fast.  i'm giving it a few day to play with the setting to see if I have to many apps running in the back ground. Stay tuned.
            "
"236","Speaker often goes in and out from being normal then to an awful echo.
            "
"237","Great product some scratches on the right side it is used but not that bad I added glass screen protection and the scratches don't even show up till you look really hard with the phone off. But every thing works better than expected I was hesitant but it was worth it I paid $402 flat and not one problem but I did have to switch providers to cricket from boost originally  but really good phone!
            "
"238","Only just received in the last day or so. Phone was new, in box, with all items described. Bluetooth file transfer works. Battery lasted a full 24 hours after getting a full charge. First phone call to husband to test phone had horrible static. Hung up and tried again and had no issue. Had several calls since with no issue. Speaker is good. Haven't used the camera much except to take some review photos. Quality is good.
            "
"239","Everything as expected. But somehow i see delay i uploading pictures whenever I'm using whatsapp which I'm not sure problem of software or hardware (band compatibility). It was difficult to go from NOTE 8 size to S9 small screen but in a week i was settled. Also lightweight body is a greay advantage especially when using it at bedtime.
            "
"240","still learning about it and getting it set up fully. only problem I had was with straight talk. took 4 days for me to finally get it online. Taking a new out of the box unlocked phone to straight talk can be confusing if you try to do it with computer or AI. call during their open hours and get a real person.
            "
"241","no problems, transferred my two chips to new phone from my S7 and works fine....expensive but worth it.
            "
"242","The best thing about this phone, or any latest Samsung phones, is that you can use the Samsung Pay at most of the places where you need to pay across the country!I just had a 45-day around the country road trip, like 99% of the time the Samsung Pay worked(except the gas stations), so I just kept a Costco credit card in my car for gas and didn't need to carry the wallet with me anymore.But sadly the newer model Samsung Galaxy S10 e moved the fingerprint sensor to the side power button, which makes that sensor much less responsive and hard to use.keep your S9!
            "
"243","Received ""midnight black S9 used-like new"" today and opened phone with all items in the box. Phone seems to be ok for now but will have to see after a fee days if it works with no defects.I was surprized to see the earphones came damaged. Looked as if one earpiece was chewed on by a pet. I am requesting a refund or a replacement for them
            "
"244","I buy unlocked phones and I've always liked galaxy.  I try to stay a year or 2 behind as I'm not paying through the nose for a latest and greatest phone.  I like this one.  I don't like that you can no longer replace the battery yourself (or have a backup one) but the life is pretty good on it.
            "
"245","Phone equipment was as expected. However, for the lower cost than from a wireless provider there was a lot of added headaches on my my end to get it activated. I am a Verizon customer. the phone initially came as a Sprint device. Verizon store was not able to help me activate this initially. It turns out the OS was from Nov 2018 and had to be upgraded before I could activate. Once I did this, I was on the phone with Verizon support for over an hour, with countless ""try this and reboot"" attempts.  It finally did work, but I put about 3 hours of my time into the activation.
            "
"246","It was ok for the first week, but then on phone everyone was telling me I was muffled and very choppy. Messages were not going out or in. Overall calling and texting doesnt work, whats the point of a phone then? This is especially terrible for me because I come off super unprofessional to clients, superiors and colleagues all who rely on me to be in touch and available at all times, which I have not been because of this garbage phone.
            "
"247","I am an android user.....i would say samsung user i loveed itt!! Bought on after 2 days of its release on market!! thanks alot!!
            "
"248","This was not to difficult to set up on verizon, just have to dial *86 to get voicemail. Put in the sim card from my old phone, signed into my google account and the phone was mostly ready to go. Love the phone, super slick. A little extra work for unlocked but not that big of a deal.
            "
"249","Absolutely love this phone and the price was astounding. Couldn't have asked for a better deal at the time of my purchase.
            "
"250","I love the looks of this phone (even tho I have have covered it up with a heavy duty case) Operation has been perfect. Easy to set up, and hook into my phone carrier (mintmoblie). It arrived quickly and unopened packaging in perfectly new condition (thanks Zeroforfive).
            "
"251","Love the phone. 256GB plus microSD slot. Fast. Nice screen. Headphone jack. Wireless charging.2 things really bother me-1- when unlocking the brightness starts BRIGHT and dims slowly. Very annoying at night.2- NO DUAL CAMERA MODE. So disappointed.
            "
"252","Returning phone...no WiFi calling. Can¡¯t use  where there isn¡¯t a network.
            "
"253","So far I am impressed with this phone's features and screen quality.  I had no problems using it in the Tracfone BYOP program and was able to connect to the network with the best signal strength in my area (Verizon CDMA).  I bought the Tracfone sim kit on Amazon.
            "
"254","I am loving this phone so far. I am still navigating thru all its features and getting an understanding of what the phone really can do. I haven't ventured into its technical features a.sfar as PowerPoint or anything. I have to read the manual to discover all the aspects of the phone but so far I'm loving it!
            "
"255","The phone per se is one of the devices I've liked the most! Fingerprint scanner at the back is so great, for me. Screen is smooth and very precise when touching it. Camera is great, if you know how to take photos A great phone overall. But, my phone specifically, stated giving me battery problems 6 months more or less after buying it. Once it hits %30 it's a matter of minutes before it goes dead
            "
"256","I'm sure that the cell phone battery is defective, because normally a new cell phone usually lasts the battery at least the full day and in my case with normal use the battery does not last the whole day, I must charge it again in the middle of the day so that last until night
            "
"257","Don't buy at the bleeding edge.  The S9 is a solid, stable, reliable phone (really a slightly faster, higher capacity refresh of the S8).  It's a top of the line device that is currently (mid-2019) at a phenomenal price point.  Can't beat it.
            "
"258","Great phone. Lives up to its qualities . Take amazing photos.  Actually is water proof o recommend getting butt plugs for it if you plan on taking photo in deep water. Everything about it was new . Battery life is a little weary I guess it depends on how much you use your phone I've had days where I dont use it and it stays at 90% and someday I dont use it and it's dying could be background app use but its provides weekly updates on battery use .. all in all great phone would recommend 100 %.. shipped as expected
            "
"259","So far love the phone.  Facial recognition lock is great and the fingerprint reader location is excellent and works better than my S7 did.Battery life is great, but it's a new phone so hard to judge that accurately at this time.
            "
"260","Pictures are awesome, even when it is almost dark, they turn out perfectly.  Have been enjoying my phone very much with no complaints
            "
"261","Was disappointed that it wasn't the US version of the phone but the Korean version it came without plastic wrapped over it and no seal but besides that everything else inside came as it should so far the phone works great
            "
"262","I bought this phone in August 2018 only th realized from an individual with s s9 that mine is not the real deal. Please stop selling things so expensive and they are fake. Now the return period have gone and dont know what to do.
            "
"263","I was expecting like a ""regular"" seal tape they would normally use you know.. the circle tape, but instead they had taped it straight top to bottom. I wanted a ""clean"" box so I tried to gently pull it off slowly. Of course I didn't come off nicely and torn the S9+ box cover. I'm not too happy with THAT, but hey... I still got the phone :/
            "
"264","I use this phone to run my own business and it has been reliable and responds quickly. Being a female, the color matters to me and I got exactly what I wanted plus some! I highly recommend this seller and this phone!
            "
"265","I had the s5, then the s6, then the s7, went back to the s5. Wasnt impressed with the s6 or s7. The s9 is a totally different matter. Very nice and improved platform. Havent found a thing I am not happy with . Well worth the price.
            "
"266","When you receive this product, make sure you get the model you bought. I ended up with the SM-9600 which is apparently the model for China and Latin America. Unfortunately, I did not realize this until after the return deadline. Phone works just have had some irritation interactions with my phone carrier because of this mix-up
            "
"267","I purchased this phone and only had it two weeks before it started freezing up and not recognizing touch on the screen. Also, this phone does not hold charge very long. I have to charge my phone at least twice a day. Very dissappointed with this phone. It was supposed to be brand new, but it does not work as it should.
            "
"268","Exactly as described! Works perfectly with Cricket Wireless!
            "
"269","Just received the product 4 days before its delivery date. Due to the influx of good/bad reviews i decided to take a shot at it. The phone box came sealed and all the contents were in the box. It only took a few seconds for my tmobile sim to be recognized and it worked with no problem. I will definitely buy from them in the future.
            "
"270","Very easy to get started- I took it to the tmobile store,  and the girl popped my sim card out of my old phone and put it into my new phone in one minute.  The battery lasts forever,  which is awesome!
            "
"271","I like this phone very much ease  to operate  I don't know what happen  I carry to my local network T.MOBIL 2-3 TIME and was not able to unlock it, I was inform by amazon  rept. to contact Samsung for help , they sent me shipping labor to return for repair (ticket number, (4148711893) week later ,Samsung return the phone  back to me , said it been  determined that the device has passed all quality control  functions successfully.  as you can see I haven had no service out the phone.
            "
"272","Great phone, great features, scored points with my wife - she is a hardcore iPhone user but the S9 changed it all.
            "
"273","I like that the phone is unlocked and is able to be used with Verizon service.The battery could last longer and the camera isn't the greatest.I give 5 stars for the price and speed of arrival.
            "
"274","Only one word to describe it""marvelous "" no buyers remorse.Join the club! Loving it.
            "
"275","While I was setting this phone up, I saw another email had already been entered. I am returning this phone and buying a s9+, hopefully I'll have better luck with it!
            "
"276","This is a great phone. I am somewhat suspicious on wether it is new or not. I received the phone in new packing. All cables and accessories were included. However, when I tried to setup the phone, I found that it had Google's FRP. Someone had already registered the phone. After about 30 mins of YouTube videos I was able to find how to correctly remove the prior account from the phone and set it up. So this is a -1 for the seller rather than the product
            "
"277","Love this phone, the picture is great and the camera rivals my Iphone, maybe even better. All I needed to do was call T-Mobile and get a sim, after that setup was a snap. Great signal and super fast
            "
"278","The digitizer on my s7 broke, so I got this phone.  It took a little adjusting, but is largely the same as the s7 in terms of features people actually use on a daily basis.  So if you've enjoyed previous s series models, you'll like this.
            "
"279","This is the best smartphone I have used yet. It comes with many useful apps and is easy to control. With a smartphone at this price, I recommend getting an extended warranty.
            "
"280","After reading some of the bad reviews, like others, I was a little nervous. Phone arrived overnight, appears to be brand new with all accessories (protective film on front and back of phone, accessories all wrapped, everything in box, but no actual seal on the box). Had to take into the T-Mobile store since my sim card was the older style large one from a Galaxy S5. They gave me a new sim (no charge), and after a firmware update and Smart Switch from my old phone in the store, all is good.
            "
"281","Thanks for exchange of device. Better as of now.
            "
"282","Very fast and durable phone. Battery lasts for a day with regular use. Camera is great, already took 1000s of photos within couple of months.

            "
"285","We just switched to prepaid and decided that since I was buying my phone outright I wanted to get away from apple after like 10 years. The phone was in great condition and unlocked like it said. All in all, it was worth every penny

"287","Works perfectly on Verizon with a stop to get a new sim card for it. (My old one was a mini.  It takes a nano)  I just hope it lasts as long as my last Samsung phone.
            "
"288","I have used android all my life. This is a very useful phone and love everything about it. I have trouble typing sometimes with my meaty fingers but that can easily be fixed by changing the keyboard style. Other than that it really is worth it. 3500 MaH will definitely last you all day. Sometimes I could be on my phone for 5 hours straight and it still be 45% or higher battery.
            "
"289","I am really happy with the Galaxy S9 phone that I have,  however, I am trading in the new unopened phone I just purchased, towards the purchase of the new Samsung Galaxy S10 phone that I'm pre- ordering today!!!

            "
"290","This phone was listed as unlocked and able to work on Verizon. After spending two hours in the Verizon store, they showed me on the phone where it was actually locked to Sprint. Total misrepresentation of what this product was supposed to be. Makes me question whether the phone was actually new or not. I wouldn't trust it, spend your money somewhere else.
            "
"291","This is crazy only a charger and an empty box wtf!! Package was open I am very disappointed!!! Never thought i would have this issue
            "
"292","So far, so good. This replaces my LG G5 and it's taking a little getting used to.  It has more onboard memory and so far the battery life has been exceptionally good.
            "
"293","It was a warehouse deal but a pair of very well used head phones that weren't even Samsung head phones that come with the phone... the headohone had ear wax chunks inside ewww gross. It was also missing the charger.The phone itself... it's nice.
            "
"294","I had Samsung galaxy s6 and I wanted to upgrade my phone with the newer version. I loved everything about s9 so far. I liked the picture quality. I bought s6 about 3years ago and it is still new except its battery drains comparatively faster and is in good shape.

            "
"298","Bought this to replace older phone (Sprint network).  Phone works wonderfully and no issues getting it on the Sprint network (just went to Sprint store for SIM card).

"299","simple a great phone....surpassed all my needs
            "
"300","I like my galaxy S 9+ very much, is very fast, takes awesome pics, sound it's great. My disappointment is that it doesn't have video chat, can't set up individual messages alert tones, can't set up wallpaper on messages, background is plain white, very boring. Besides that it is a good quality phone.
            "
"301","Was initially tempted by the Moto G6 or X4 but the S9, in addition to more sensors used in various application, has better processor, very good camera, microphone which are useful when used with Smule!
            "
"302","No bad review or nothing out of the ordinary. The phone was exactly as I purchased it through Amazon, new and with all the accesories mentioned. It has good quality of sound and image.
            "
"303","Love the phonbne but HATE, I mean HATE, the terrible typing! Adds letters, etc I never hit! Have to type real slow.. otbyerwuse thi87s happens
            "
"304","I love the size of the screen and the phone overall.  Great purchase for a good price.  I have paid a lot more for my other phones.  This phone was unlocked!
            "
"305","itz goooooood
            "
"306","I received the phone with chargers, earphones, usb connector in a samsung case. It worked fine for the first few days, but later  slowed down a little bit.  It happended for a week. Now, it works fine. I havenot encountered any further issue. It a good phone, and I am enjoying it.
            "
"307","Despite what people say here, this """"unlocked"""" phone DOES NOT work on Verizon. I bought one of these on Amazon, took it to the Verizon store and they said it was incompatible. The information on this page is very misleading. I will be returning it for a full refund.As for the phone itself, it is fine. It's a modern phone. But if I can't use it to make calls/texts it is worthless as a phone.
            "
"308","Light weight and slim. Very fast processor.
            "
"309","Very pleased with the price.  Samsung has been sending me a number of ads to buy this, for the wonderful price of $200 more than I paid on Amazon
            "
"310","I bought this phone for straight talk. Put in the sim card and it was good to go. My first Samsung and it blows every other phone I've ever had out of the water. Wish i would have switched over a long time ago
            "
"311","What can I say?  It's a brand new Galaxy S9 with all the bells and whistles.  Came in perfect condition and has been excellent since I received it for Christmas.  Would buy again in a heart beat!
            "
"312","Bought the Samsung S9 from Liquid Deals, nowhere did it say it was used. Thought I was buying a new. Unexceptable!
            "
"313","excellent...arrived on time and brand new. everything functions as it should
            "
"314","Customizable, not as many limitations as iPhone, data transfer smooth overall great camera quality and battery life is just amazing would buy a million times.

"316","Zero stars. I got a fake phone.
            "
"317","I liked everything about this phone. Wished that Samsung would get it together when it comes to their tablets. Phones I recommend, tablets no.
            "
"318","Love love love this! The speed is amazing, I only have to charge once a day and use constantly, the picture is better than expected. I seriously love everything about it. I upgraded from an s5 and samsung didn't disappoint.
            "
"319","The service seems to be spotty with the S9. My S7 never had any issues with service area. There are certain areas in my home that have a bad connection or drop calls. Frustrating
            "
"320","Perfect. Arrived, put in my sim  and waited for everything to load. I run off cricket wireless. No issues, great deal. Less than in store
            "
"321","I took a picture out in the rain. Now it has water damage and I can't charge it. I can't return it because the warranty ended last month. I'm so pissed. Oh and the back of the screen shattered even with a 5 star case on it. So basically this phone is made of porcelain.
            "
"322","I'd like to start out by saying I've never had any of the previous galaxies, so I don't know how the S9+ companies to previous models. That saying, I absolutely love this phone. I recently switched to the Galaxy S9+ from the ZTE Axon 7 because of the limitations on that phone. The Axon 7 is a really good phone, and although it is an android, there are a lot of differences between that phone and Samsung Androids.The Galaxy S9+ has a great battery life, I charge it using the wireless fast charger in the morning before work and it will last all day through a 10 hour shift plus the gym. I like all the security features like the fingerprint scanner and face detection. It also has great memory and runs easily. I can do multiple things at a time and have multiple windows open and it's not a problem. The sound is also really good, I don't have to turn it up as loud to get the same quality music as with my old phone and the display for the screen is awesome. I take pictures and they look like they are in hd. By far one of my favorite features is the edge panel where you can put frequently used apps and contacts and such. I use that all the time.So far I have no complaints. I've been using this phone for about a month and I'm in love with it. Also buying it through Amazon using their store card and 24 month financing was a plus. That's the only way I could afford such a high price phone.I would definitely recommend this phone to someone else. I never rate anything 5 stars, but as of now the Galaxy S9+ is worth it.
            "
"323","Took the phone to boost and when they scanned it, it said the phone could not be activated.  Had to return and bought a phone locally so I could have it before Christmas.  I am sure it would have been great if it activated.
            "
"324","My wife bought me this Samsung S9Plus for my birthday. I am used to a Apple products ( iPads,iPhones & etc ) I love this Phone because it does everything I use it for. Calls,watch movies,reading and alarms.. I like the wireless charging which makes it so easy to use and know where it is at night time. Bixby ( like Alex) is another feature that I like besides the big screen. I like this phone
            "
"325","Bought a used phone and it looks brand new when recieved.Purchased from an amazon warehouse deal. Everything is like new, and barely  used. Good price and good quality. The descriptions were accurate just like it described. Overall using this device its like brand new with an good deal. Downside was that it collected tax, but overall it was an quality  i wanted.
            "
"326","Received a International model(SM-G965F/DS) with no warranty.
            "
"327","This is my first smart phone. The learning curve was more than I expected. I am still woeking on all the many features.
            "
"328","Love everything except  Bixby.  I have just muted that feature with no problem. Perfect size
            "
"329","Picture quality and voice clarity is great.  I like WiFi calling feature this phone comes with which is great for people with poor network connections in the general surroundings.  However the battery seems to drain too quick even with no phone activity which I was surprised and not too happy.  Otherwise its a good purchase
            "
"330","I brought this phone 1 month ago im satisfied with this s9+ but the main thing is i paid 700+ dolars i i got sprint network phone its unlocked but this sprint i cannot remove and when im using hot spot i t can connect only 1 user per time and that sprint aplications i have i cant remove them i think its not fair to give a sprint or any other provider phones unlocked sonpeople to struggle with this kind of things
            "
"331","I love it like omg I¡¯ve reading the reviews and the photos they take I was scary that it was going to be but hey what a surprise I gotta the Samsung galaxy 9+ but sadly the s10 out lol idc I love the phone
            "
"332","I did not undetstand unlocked meant that so.e features with own carrier might not work. Sending back to buy locked version from retailer.
            "
"333","I just got my  Samsung Galaxy S9 yesterday so far I  really like itI'll update on a later date
            "
"334","Its everything I expected and more.  I went from an S7 edge to the 9+ and I'm in love.  The camera, the screen, its fast and responsive.  Took time getting used to but I'm still digging it.
            "
"335","The phone is ok overall but the battery life sucks it cannot last me throughout the day and I didn't receive a Samsung ear plugs
            "
"336","She Absolutely 100% love this phone. I got it for my lady for Christmas, all she can do is show everyone and talk about how amazing the camera is. Awesome job Samsung!!
            "
"337","US cellular says you can't use all of the features because this phone wasn't made for US cellular. Plus we get poor service now, like dropped calls and slow internet.
            "
"338","this is a great phone.  very easy to use and looks great.  alot of great features.
            "
"339","It's a nice phone. Just go to an actual store. Maybe you won't get 3 defects in a row.
            "
"340","1. Shipped to Alaska. Good job. Wouldn't ship to my location in Alaska which I found odd but it's cool we made it work.2. Got a sim card pack from AT&T, and hooked rite up. No hassle no worries. I love this phone. Thanks so much
            "
"341","The screen cracked from a lite touch on the edge making it very ugly to look at.
            "
"342","I live in Canada and I purchased this phone. It's an unlocked phone like it states. So it works for all providers. You dont need to worry about that. Dont let the model number fool you. The model number is the North American version. The ""1"" you see at the end, only means it's an unlocked phone. Everything was in the box. Excellent condition. And it actually arrived 1 day before expected. Its absolutely fantastic for its price. I saved like $300!
            "
"343","I will start this review by stating that I live in a very weak signal area no matter what device is used. This being said, I compared the S9+ to a Note 9 and a 50.00 LG. Very weak antenna compared to other phones! Tried 2 different 9+ both had same weak reception. I compared to Note 9 and a cheap LG - even the cheap LG had a stronger signal.
            "
"344","Does everything that it's supposed to... I pulled the nano-sim card out of my old S6 active... then tranfered everything ... I have AT&T...and it works without any problem... came with every thing... ear phones...wall charger ...sim card tool... and the cable to transfer all my pictures and text ...  perfect !!!
            "
"345","The S9+ has a crack on the back and small hairline cracks on the front screen, the accessories came scratched on purpose.
            "
"346","Great phone for the price.  This is my first Samsung phone, so far I am very happy with the performance.There is one issue.The charger connection is not working properly. I have to plug in on a special side of the type C head.
            "
"347","I just received my S9 late afternoon on 4/7/19 . I charged it overnight. Today, April 8th 2019 I brought it to Sprint store to activate the device. However, the representative tried twice to activate and said it was not compatible with Sprint services. Now, I have no emergency phone and we have no landline. Not happy after being told it was unlocked for Sprint carriers.
            "
"348","Battery dies fast and constant opens Bixby and wallet. Keyboard adds space in middle of words. Finger print is awesome
            "
"349","Exactly as described! Just inserted my sim card and everything worked! Awesome buy!
            "
"350","The phone  is stylish and works great with my straight talk SIM card. I'm not real pleased with the camera quality though. I think my Galaxy s7 takes better pictures
            "
"351","Love the phone, saved me $300 from the Verizon store. With all the accessories I wanted it still came put $100 less than Verizon. Activation was easy and came with a sim card removal tool, took me all of 7 minutes to activate on Verizon without any help from them. Only drawback was the long shipping time but it was economy shipping and free. Otherwise no complaints!
            "
"352","This phone is so sick. So fast and screen is amazing. Great for the price. I got it thro 5 months payments. Thanks Amazon.
            "
"353","So far everything has been great with the new device, it came in perfect condition and Verizon SIM worked immediately. Battery life is very good.
            "
"354","WARNING: If you want a protection plan that covers loss or theft, don't buy your phone on Amazon! I just bought this Galaxy S9 and I can't find any company that will sell me a protection plan which covers loss or theft.Asurion seems to only sell warranties through phone carriers, Squaretrade doesn't cover theft, and it looks like Verizon won't sell me the coverage because I didn't buy the phone from them, also I'm not on contract. I'll update this if I have any luck, I'll probably just end up returning this and buying a phone from Verizon, even though I am mad at them :(...
            "
"355","Ordered this phone during black Friday. I've read review about this smartphone and was wondering if it won't work or I will get it used. However, I got this phone brand new (as I think) and inside the box almost everything was ok. There was no seal and it was kind of dust or smth I don't know. Ordered it New from Samsung and it still works. If anything happens, I will update this review
            "
"356","I recommend this phone to anyone who uses a smart phone. It's easy to set up, much support from Samsung.
            "
"357","So far so good! I'm excited about the price! It's a slim phone for sure and also narrow. I upgraded from a s7
            "
"358","This phone is the best I ever had. Using it is easy, and the screen is very clear and sharp.
            "
"359","This was an international phone and would not work with Sprint. I was able to receive a full refund.
            "
"360","At first, I was apprehensive because of the deal price, then some of the international reviews, this is the U.S. version... brand new, I popped the sim card out of my Verizon s8 into this and that's it, I'm online, activated messaging calls data and everything 30 seconds later!
            "
"361","Great phone. Unlocked so just moved sim to new phone and had service. Works well, lots of features.
            "
"362","Got the wrong item
            "
"363","I do love this phone!! I didn't think I would be able to afford a new galaxy since I'm non-contact, so when I saw this on a PAYMENTS option??? I jumped on this deal!!! Very happy. Thanks Amazon! <U+0001F60A>
            "
"364","Love the updated version. Hate the screen is shattered already.
            "
"365","It's quite big for average hand so it's hard to use with one hand. Face recognition still needs some work as it requires the face to be at similar distance that you had programmed with. Don't think it ever work with sunglasses. Other than that,  no complain as of yet.
            "
"366","I started to switch to an iPhone after having issues with the s7.. decided to get the s9+ and am impressed. This phone is awesome!!
            "
"367","Love Galaxy phones and this is a big step up from my S7.  Love the color! Did have an issue with the 1st phone I received, it stopped charging and the screen became unresponsive within 2 weeks of receiving.  Amazon did however replace it after a few calls.
            "
"368","A replacement for a dead Samsung S5, this was a great choice - very satisfied all around.
            "
"369","I purchased this mobile on thanksgiving and i would say this was one of a fantastic model in the recent years.Picture quality was amazing and have a very good battery life, though i'm a minimal user (I do not use heavy apps).Thank you Amazon for a wonderful deal and thank you Samsung for a quality phone..!
            "
"370","We are having problems getting data on our phone went to provider it¡¯s set up correctly
            "
"371","Great phone. Looks and feels great in your hand. Still like my iPhone better
            "
"372","Works with straight talk Verizon sim card. Haff to call a few times to get someone to set the data up properly, but other than that. I love this phone so much.
            "
"373","Cell service seems to be less than my old model....6s active.  At my house I usually 9nly get one bar for a signal and sometimes NO bars while others in the house (same cell provider) have 2- 3 bars all the time.
            "
"374","Only had for a short time but everything seems to work correctly
            "
"375","Do you know if you will have the 256 gig available? I've already ordered 2 phones and need a 3rd but I want the higher capacity model. Phones are awesome btw.
            "
"376","Love my phone; battery last the all day.The camera makes nice quality photos; large display. Overall great phone.
            "
"377","Definitely won't need to upgrade for a while, best phone I've had to date.
            "
"378","It was a good deal. I honestly expected a bit more of the battery but since the phone has so many features (that can be turned off) it consumes a lot of energy. But the product in general fullfil my expectations and I'm happy with my purchase.
            "
"379","I have no complaints or problems with this phone.  A bit pricey, but functionality and feature-wise, love it.
            "
"380","Previously had the moto E4 +5000 unit batteryLasted foreverWish this phone did otherwise fast function
            "
"381","This international model won't let you turn off the camera shutter noise and is incompatible with TWRP and all other Android root methods.
            "
"382","I finally upgraded from my Note 4. Man, what a difference!Like going from a Ford to a Ferrari.
            "
"383","Phone is perfect in every aspect. The battery lasts longer than my old iPhone 6. This is my first upgrade to Android so I find no issues with the battery. So far I'm loving the phone.
            "
"384","All the features, all the upgrades.  It's a beautiful infinity screen.  Best purchase EVER!!
            "
"385","This is the best phone I've ever owned. Transferring all my contacts, photos, videos and apps was a breeze. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because after paying nearly a thousand dollars for this phone, I still had to go to the Verizon store, plunk down another hundred bucks to get the SIM card and to use that to activate the phone.
            "
"386","Awesome phone, the battery life is excellent and the picture quality
            "
"387","I absolutely love the photo quality. It Also came really fast. I love Amazon and I¡¯ve never bought a Phone off of it for but this just proves it. Amazon is the best! The sound is great too!
            "
"388","do not buy phones, etc from amazon
            "
"389","The phone I got was not as advertised. Tried to activate it and when it didn't work, contacted verizon, for them to tell me that the phone wasn't being recognized by their system, and wasn't unlocked.
            "
"390","My 3 year old Samsung S6 Edge got pink line issue, so thought of replacing the phone. I got this Samsung S9 from Amazon. Great price for Cyber Monday. The battery life is great. Picture quality is wonderful. The security features are good.
            "
"391","Just like new. Love my phone no scratches dents or anything. Setup was easy.
            "
"392","Came in genuine packaging with all parts and manuals. Phone was brand new, worked flawlessly
            "
"393","Battery life sucks! It will be drained half way in your day no matter how you use it. I called both Amazon support and Samsung support, both recomended to adjust the brightness of my screen :|
            "
"394","It has a glitch with speakerphone.  If you are using speaker it is a 50/50 chance the person on the other line won't hear you. I think this is a glitch that Samsung already knows about. Otherwise,  I love the phone but I like the older models.
            "
"395","Charges quickly.  Everything transferred easily.  I love my new phone.
            "
"396","The phone randomly disconnects from calls and internet.  It is unreliable and for a phone that I bought in October, the product support window closed on January 10th.  I guess they figured that since the phone will die in three months they should not offer support a minute beyond that.  Don't buy this unless you have disposable income.
            "
"397","I use this phone nonstop (even for this review). Very solid choice, responsive, haven't had any issues.
            "
"398","Used it for less than 2 months and it has started being kicked off the VZW mobile network. It no longer can be registered on the network, so it's totally useless. Amazon is charging a restocking fee. STAY AWAY, DON'T BY IF YOU WISH TO USE Verizon wireless service.
            "
"399","Used it for a month or more now & no issues, definitely be purchasing my next phone this way also!
            "
"400","Estaba tal cual la publicacion.  Muy buen producto.  Es dificil todavia evaluar durabilidad por el corto plazo de uso pero hasta ahora ha sido excelente su funcionamiento.

"410","I received the phone today and I've been playing with it all day I have not had one issue. And I also have straight talk I just switched my sim around and it worked great. Also everything on the phone works great! I would recommend this phone to anyone I know looking into getting an android or switching phones.
            "
"411","Delivered faster than expected. Phone is in great condition. I can't see anything wrong with it. Still learning all the features  no scratches. Very pleased.
            "
"412","I haven't had much time with the phone as of yet.  I am disappointed that the description says it comes with a USB cable but mine didn't.
            "
"413","AWESOME
            "
"414","love it, upgraded from iphone 7plus
            "
"415","The appliance came with the back cover broken. Unfortunately I live in Brazil and I can not send the device back. I am extremely dissatisfied with Samsung lack of quality.
            "
"416","Upgraded from another Samsung and I love how easy this was to set up! Lots of cool features with the S9+
            "
"417","This product was being sold as new. The phone was clearly used as evidenced by a Samsung Cloud account set up and a user icon. Definitely being returned.
            "
"418","This phone has a mind of its own. Very unhappy with it
            "
"419","Unlocked US version.  I simply swapped the SIM card from my iPhone to this one and ran Smart Switch.  Was up and running in under 30 minutes. Beautiful screen and decent battery life.  Works on the Verizon CDMA network and the data speed is noticeably faster than my previous iPhone 7+ on the same network.  Earphones that came with it sound great as well, which is a plus.  I have gone back and forth between Android and iPhone over the years.  My last Android was a Galaxy S5+ which was an energy hog.  Given the power of this phone I find the battery life impressive.
            "
"420","Wife not complaining,  I like it.
            "
"421","This was given as a gift. She loves it
            "
"422","My phone has started dropping calls after only 5 months.  I often can't send or receive texts and the call quality has gotten very bad.  I am extremely disappointed that there isn't anything Amazon can do for this faulty phone.

"430","Great phoneMy only regret is I should have ordered the S9 plus for the larger screen, but I love the phone!
            "
"431","Loved this phone. Perfect packaging and easy to set up. I opened the box put in my sim card and was done.
            "
"432","Exactly what it says
            "
"433","This is simply the best cell phone I have ever bought.
            "
"434","Best phone I've ever owned. Beautiful design, screen, camera, etc....
            "
"435","Factory unlocked, just pop your old sim card in and go. Tested it out with both Verizon and AT&T chips in the US and it works perfectly.
            "
"436","Tengo  problemas con el cargador del telefono cada vez que lo conecto  me sale un mensaje que dice carga lenta y que lo conecte al equipo original como es posible que siendo  un equipo  nuevo  me envien  con un cargador que no sirve  necesito qu me ayuden con este inconveniente .
            "
"437","Love my phone
            "
"438","This phone really needs a user's manual or you'll miss out on a lot of the wonderful things this phone can do. I went from a S5 to a S9. Ask Bixby, she'll help you.
            "
"439","Great phone
            "
"440","I have upgraded from s8 plus and I really see an improvement in the performance , especially camera, AR emoji and face detection features are awesome.
            "
"441","Very satisfied with my phone, but did think it was a bit pricey.
            "
"442","The Bluetooth chip came broken in my phone. Very annoying and taking a long time to repair. Better to buy something more sure than something that could possibly arrive broken.
            "
"443","It s not originalGive my money back!
            "
"444","Is your phone 4g in the US? I bought this phone and my internet is terrible. My 4g is not working at all. And the phone is not even showing that is a 4g. Its terrible.
            "
"445","Love this phone so much! It is the best I've ever had.
            "
"446","I am a Samsung Galaxy fan, haven't been disappointed yet.
            "
"447","Love everything about! Samsung diehard!
            "
"448","Everything works except for the iris's!
            "
"449","I returned this phone because it was not unlocked. Unlocking the phone would have cost me $39.
            "
"450","When i received phone the both part of the screen did not work like it should. I used it 2 more weeks to see if i could get past that and one night the screen turned black with a light line at the top. I went through the process of returning the phone almost a month ago AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY REFUND.
            "
"451","An overall good phone. Highly satisfied with it. Would recommend.
            "
"452","Good
            "
"453","Phone calls are a lil low at times but other sound are fine. Everything else about the phone so far is perfect and I believe will be a fine investment. My s5 lasted me 3 years, so I hope it will last me as long if not longer.
            "
"454","I broke my s9+ in less than 6 months so needed something urgent. Amazon is great,it did ship me in less than 24 hours and I'm happy with my phone
            "
"455","Love my new phone
            "
"456","Love it
            "
"457","Works as it should. Sim card fit perfect. Factory phone, unlocked.
            "
"458","Reasonably sized, capable smartphone with decent battery life.
            "
"459","I'm very happy with this phone!!!
            "
"460","Well worth the money spent!!
            "
"461","Arrived fast. Perfect condition at a great price
            "
"462","It feels like the android slips from top to bottom like happened with my moto.. I did not call to verify  my s9 to make sure was not a knock off. I was assured my Amazon sales person it wasn't. Think I will go
            "
"463","I was expecting a longer battery life although I'm pleasantly pleased to be able to enjoy my phone all day doing everything I want with my phone off of one charge. That includes movie watching, social media, emails, pandora, web surfing, and amazing picture taking.
            "
"464","Couldn't ask for a better operating and functioning phone. Feature rich!
            "
"465","Love my galaxy, switched to galaxy after the iphone 6 and havent looked back for a second
            "
"466","It's a Excellent Phone. I was very afraid about some coments by the screen, but has been dropped several times and has not suffered any damage. I love the color, it's beautiful, It is very simple to manage, with a LOT of options to play about the camera, the security, the apps. I'm very happy with my purchase
            "
"467","Absolutely love the Samsung Galaxy s9.
            "
"468","I was nervous to order after reading some reviews stating the phone wasn't included or they received a dummy phone. But it arrived quickly and was exactly as described. Came with all the accessories and works with at&t
            "
"469","Trivial to setup. Required a couple reboots to get from sprint to at&t. One sw upgrade needed. Android to android sim change was quite easy. Still missing my historical message conversations though. It's only day one currently.
            "
"470","Bad description! Not all unlocked S9 work on all carriers. Only Verizon unlocked version has CDMA.
            "
"471","Great phone with wonderful features,  but the battery doesn't last longer.
            "
"472","Good phone
            "
"473","Great product! Much higher quality and experience than my last Samsung smart phone. In my opinion the S9+ outclasses the iPhone by every measure.
            "
"474","Came on time and was everything it said in the description.
            "
"475","As advertised. Love the device, love the screen. I am very happy with my purchase.
            "
"476","Buena compra...!!Me gusto
            "
"477","Solid phone with great features. The camera is good but sending video through text/mms is blurry. I don't think Samsung has fixed this issue yet.
            "
"478","I just started using it, but so far it is GREAT!!!
            "
"479","As expected
            "
"480","So far I love this phone.  It is a bit more narrow than my old phone, same length, so I""m happy with it, overall.  I""m still learning about its features and love Bixby!  So far, so good!
            "
"481","I love it! Came in perfect condition!
            "
"482","as expected.
            "
"483","As described
            "
"484","Enjoying this phone. It came just in time for my meeting at work.
            "
"485","Love this phone.
            "
"486","Super good phone
            "
"487","I ordered this phone and when I opened my package the phone was missing. This is unacceptable. I want my money back.
            "
"488","Perfect condition works great
            "
"489","Really good. My girlfriends birthday present and she loves it
            "
"490","Good
            "
"491","After I spent an entire day transferring and setting up the phone I realized the next day there is no wifi calling.. samsung s9s have wifi calling and this unlocked phone does not.. nice phone but have to have wifi calling. Its also a feature you pay for.
            "
"492","The US version of this phone has a bootloader that cannot be unlocked. This is blatantly anti-consumer and renders the phone useless unless you intend to use the stock firmware unmodified...and why would you? I recommend strongly against this phone.
            "
"493","We are very disappointed with the way shipping was made. Being on PRIME it got delivered 4 days late. We shipped it as a gift and it reached much later than the occasion which did not serve our purpose. Very disappointed. Personally I won a Samsung phone and I love it.
            "
"494","Im the kind of user that jumps from iphone to android, convinced that Android offers a lot more but the problem lies in components with each manufacturer. I only buy flagship smartphones as Im a power user and I decided to give it a go with the impressive S9.Im extremely happy.Im not getting into details and specs, the internet is already loaded with them, I think the experiences is more valuable to you.The device is top notch,  Migrating from another android device or an iphone is extremely easy with the included adapter,  screen is wonderful, no surprise considering Samsung builds the iPhone X screen. Well obviously Samsung is the screen guru nowadays.Everything is great on this device, works much better than iphone in bluetooth connections, is extremely fast etc.UI is very good, and packed with options. Fast charging is impressive, 10 to 100 in 60 mins. And battery lasts all day with normal use.Cellular signal strenght is very good, wifi is very good, its wather proof, what else can you ask for?
            "
"495","Best phone I've ever had. I would recommend to anybody !
            "
"496","maravilloso
            "
"497","Really good phone. I liked how it takes pictures, internet connection is fast, and overall speed of the phone while opening apps. More advanced features to use for those who like to experience something new. So far I am glad that I bought this Samsung Galaxy S9.
            "
"498","Phone looks nice has good picture and sound quality, but the battery life is average.
            "
"499","buen producto
            "

"502","too skinny
            "

            "
"504","Great phone. The camera is the best.
            "
"505","NO SEAL ON BOX (only tape). NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL/TERMS&CONDITIONS. Returning.
            "
"506","This phone is not unlocked. Took it to the verizon store and they said this phone was not enabled for their service.
            "
"507","Use to a j7 13 mp camera other than that happy. Great upgrade even with the down step in camera. Truly unlocked phone has cdma I use boost mobile through sprint network. Can not activate online have to buy sim card pack and do over phone or always can go in store.
            "
"508","Upgraded from my s7 and absolutely love this phone.
            "
"509","You won't find a bigger and better Android phone than the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus, thanks to its oversized 6.2-inch curved screen and low-light-defeating dual-lens camera.
            "
"510","I bought this phone 6 months ago, I loved using it, the battery is fine, I really like the camera and the space of it, but I left my phone fall on the floor and its phone screen just cracked badly so you can see it's not a good quality
            "
"511","Love the new Samsung  Galaxy S9  Phone.  Had a s7 edge, this is more efficient,  better in everyway. Absolutely would recommend this phone to anyone.
            "

"515","Good phone and has a great camera
            "
"516","This phone is amazing.  There is nothing more to say. The picture quality is amazing, the software is amazing. I thought transitioning to Iphone to Andriod would be hard but it really isn't.
            "
"517","Pretty awesome phone that you can get a great deal for at the time of this purchase (Nov 2018)

            "
"538","Upgraded from an S7. So big step up.
            "
"539","After 2 month of use out of nowhere the cellphone screen is not working. i have dead zones and the screen is flickering. I live in Argentina and Samsung's Argentina does not want to fix it since i bought it in USA. I need a solution right away!!!!

            "
"542","I'm quite the heavy user, so the battery life only lasts about 13-15 hours. The phone runs smooth and handle everything I throw at it with ease. Great buy  so far. Been using it for just under a month, and will update if anything changes :)

"551","Me encanto
            "
"552","So far so good, I have no complaints about the phone, just got it so I'm still figuring everything out. Had a little trouble getting phone activated, however one that was taken care of the phone had been great!
            "
"553","Love my Samsung .
            "
"554","Took phone to Cellular provider for set up and was told that someone else still owes payments on the phone so it¡¯s blocked on their system. So basically the phone was a stolen item being resold.
            "
"555","works perfectly I made an excellent purchase.
            "
"556","This is the worst top of the line samsung phone I have ever owned and how the heck you get any kind of replacement for this junk. restart on or 2 times a day because applications quit, screen flips out and goes where it wants instead of to the icon you press. Try to answer phone calls and you have to back out of all other screens and if you try to close all screens it shuts off the phone call. S9+ just plain sucks
            "
"557","Was concerned that it wouldn't work with my provider. Took it out of the box, inserted my Straight Talk SIM card and I have a working phone. Thrilled with my purchase!
            "
"558","i do not like nothing
            "
"559","Muy bueno
            "

            "
"561","I received the phone in perfect conditions with all the original items included (charger, headphones, etc). I've been using the phone more than a month and I didn't have any problem. I'm happy with my phone so far.

            "
"564","No problem setting this up with sprint without all the unneccesary sprint apps and them take it to ATT or Verizon just by getting there sim card. Beautiful phone with all accessories new in original box!

            "
"585","The phone was an AT&T phone. My carrier tried everything but was unable to unlock it. After waiting for >3 weeks to get the phone,I had to return it. Wasted > 1 month of my time. Most aggravating. Just tell the truth!
            "
"586","FAST PHONE,great pictures, expandable memory and is splash proof. Very happy with my buy

            "
"589","Just great
            "
"590","Easy to set up following the instructions given.  I was nervous I that I would not be able to set the phone up myself but instructions that come with the phone make it very easy. Had S4 that I upgraded from.
            "
"591","Everything was GREAT, though a quite a few months later the battery has weakened a bit and the performance is starting to have a few issues. Though that's a natural thing I assume with phones, just like my old s6.
            "
"592","The newest S9 is simply TERRIFIC! It works in Venezuela.

"603","Great cell phone
            "
"604","Product is for personal use, Samsung's definitely where it's at. It hits the sweet spots as well = long battery life, quick to charge. Overall condition of package upon arrival was beyond satisfactory.

            "
"607","Amazing Phone
            "
"608","I'm not an idiot... but this phone makes me feel like an idiot.  I purchased the phone via Amazon for my Verizon service 2 months ago.  It started having problems (randomly resetting etc).  I booted in SAFE mode and even attempted to do a factory reset.  The phone is in an endless boot cycle.  I've found that getting it serviced is a challenge.  Verizon couldn't help me, Calling Samsung directly couldn't help me.... they've told me to contact Amazon directly which I'm about to do.It's pretty obvious that the market couldn't sustain quality issues like this, so I think I got a lemon.
            "

"620","If you don't use the phone constantly,  it will last a good 4 days. If you do use it constantly,  it will still last about 2, before you have to charge it again.

"653","I love this device.  Excellent buy.. I would recommend this wonderful device to anyone.
            "
"654","The phone over time got much slower
            "
"655","Fast, packed with customization, beautiful pictures. Occasionally I trigger the edges when I use it in landscape mode but that's not too big of a deal. I wish it was less of a headache to disable bixby. Even though I have an app that controls bixby, I still see bixby being triggered slightly before the new intended shortcut is triggered. If you're going to use a work profile on here, be warned that depending on your place of work you will not be able to use custom keyboards (understandably so). It's just a bit confusing when my s7 allowed the use of custom keyboards and the s9+ will not (both phones were used for the same job, don't know why the standards are different). Great phone, I'm glad I bought it and am having a better experience with it than the phones I've owned previously (Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy s7, Nexus 7, Pixel XL, Moto X).Update September 5, 3018Lowering the rating for this. It's only been a few months but I'm already starting to have battery issues. I went from not managing my battery too much to constantly needing to charge and top off my phone. I've started to have a strange charging issue where my phone won't fast charge even though its reporting that its doing so. The only charger that I've found to somewhat efficiently charge my phone is an unmarked charger I got from work. Otherwise it takes forever to charge even to 70%. I have yet to contact a Samsung service center but will am afraid I'll need to. I've tried ever trouble shooting method short of master resetting my phone. After experiencing these issues with the s7 a while back I'm thinking I might go away from the galaxy line at this point. Will report back if I'm able to fix the issue, such a pain.
            "
"656","I love my new phone thank y'all
            "

            "
"661","Guess what it works.
            "
"662","I use this phone daily and the charge lasts me the entire day. Great phone except I don't like how many apps come installed with the phone. I've had the S7 and S8 and will continue to use Samsung phones.

"696","I don't know how a brand new phone came  with a battery charger's cable damaged ? I need the battery chargers cable  to re-charge my phone.
            "
"697","(It still gets 5/5 stars because the phone was functioning perfect, just doesn't work on Sprint)Okay, so after trying to activate the first one at Sprint, they said the phone was either the international version (it doesn't appear to be) or it was locked (also doesn't appear to be). So, Amazon was super helpful in exchanging the phone for another, saying the serial numbers must have been confused.  I try to activate the second one, and run into the same exact issue.  Sprint does NOT have the IMEIs of these phones on their list of eligible devices, regardless of everything (model/unlocked/unbranded) pointing to this phone being eligible.  Other carriers experience may vary.
            "

            "
"708","The only thing I deslike is the fact that it's not dual chip, which is something that isn't clearly detailed.  As I had a dual chip S8, I thought it was a brand pattern.

"819","So far I have not seen a notable diffrence between the S8 and the S9.I have not tried the camera in dark places yet,  but honestly,  since a went from the S8 to the S9, i feel like im still using the S8.The S9 is working great no issues at all, i bought it unlocked and I'm using it with Cricket.I will post an uodate once i get to use it more.

"863","I love samsung phones this is not the exception. Really happy with the purchase.
            "
"864","I bought the S9 directly from Samsung.com, and wow was that a huge mistake. I got the phone, switched over my service with Verizon and sent the old phone off for credit. The next day I noticed the S9 had some minor physical damage from shipping. I was going to let it slide but thought, nah, I just bought this thing, its on them to fix it.Samsung refuses to do anything but a refund for sending back the phone. I cant be without a phone, my business depends on me talking to clients. I asked them to send me a new one and ill return the defective one once i switch my service over. They refuse. I'm blown away. Had I bought the phone from Amazon, Best Buy or, hell, even Verizon, they would have given me that option. I tried talking to managers, I tried using chat, email, nothing works.The phone itself inst bad, but Samsung customer service is disgusting. This is coming from a guy who has their 75"" QLED TV, Family Hub Smart Fridge, touchscreen washer and dryer, and literally everything else Samsung offers.You lost a customer for life, and i loved you guys. What a sad way to go.

"948","Too many missing features. You enjoyed having custom notification sounds for individual e-mails? Too bad, ""we're working on getting that feature back to you."" You want the Samsung e-mail app to automatically show you e-mails from longer than 6 months ago? Nope, you'll have to do a search. Does your VIP have more than one email address listed in his contacts? Oh, we'll just split them into two separate contacts when you import them into the email app! Oh, you want that person to show as only ONE contact? Too bad, that feature isn't available!Honestly, the downgraded features make this ""upgraded"" phone average at best. Pay a premium price, get a standard phone. Great job, Samsung. I'll update this with a better review IF they put back these integral features.

I was a little anxious tabout rying out this new phone I have never used a Samsung phone before, but withing two days I got a used to this phoneIts so easy to use. You can customize it it's got so many features.It even gives you hints while using it.The phone is just awesome. And for those who are concerned about app security all you have to do is modify the apps settings. you can controll the apps access to your content and your contacts also.when I think about the price compared to an iPhone xIts so much more reasonably pricedThis phone is way ahead of iPhoneI usually dont write reviews but this phone deserves my reviewTry it, you will be amazedIt's an awesome phone.this phone is way ahead apple has a lot of work to doWish I could buy this phone for everyone I knowOn a scale of 1 through 5This phone deserves a 7 stars

"979","The keyboard on this phone is horrible no matter what you change the settings to or how large you make the keyboard. The phone is not as advanced as an iOS when working with other apps cutting and pasting, sharing, or simply managing pictures and contacts on your personal computer. I could have dealt with tha t but the keyboard was simply not functional. You have an added fingerprint scan to open apps but you will ah e to log in and reset frequently. DON¡¯T FORGET YOUR PASSWORDS!  At any given time you will be required to log in manually more often unlike the iPhone.

Ordered it new and that's the way it came.Such a smooth experience with any new phone and I'm hoping it doesn't get bogged down over time. Definitely a better choice than the $1,000+ new iPhone, for my budget.  Awesome camera and I'm still learning some of the features coming from a Motorola.

I hope Samsung will improve this issue with an update as soon as possible. Bixby button sucks. Portrait mode  cam is not so good as iPhone X.
            "
"1013","Got this phone to replace the BLU R1 HD and let me tell you it is a fantastic upgrade! I have yet to delve I to all of the software features of the phone yet but as an all around every day use phone, it's amazing! I tested the slow motion video out while I was in Wyoming for A.T. and it works like a charm (except for in totally dark settings, as there's not enough light to activate the feature). Should I have waited a few more months for the S10? Maybe but I don't regret this purchase as it's an amazing phone well worth the price. Will update this review once I've had it for six months.
            "
"1014","The Samsung bloatware is outrageous and there is no way to remove it. You can disable most of it but it then still nags you to use it. I already bought the phone, why must I use your awful apps? None are any better than the stock android versions of the exact same thing. This phone would be 5 stars if it came with stock android.
            "
"1015","Okay... doesn't live up to the hype.
            "
"1016","I love my new phone. It is the right size and easy to handle for my smaller hands. I enjoy using the ""swipe"" feature on this phone as it can be done with one hand. The phone is very responsive. I haven't had it long enough to learn all the features, but so far, it has worked wonderfully and met my expectations.
            "
"1017","Not only did I receive a European model instead of a US model, but this phone did not have CDMA capability to work with Verizon (despite what the review questions/answers state). The phone does work with AT&T which I ended up having to switch to to get it working.
            "
"1018","I bought it as a gift to my sister and she love him!
            "
"1019","Love the new phone. Been with the galaxy series since #3. I am with straight talk and this phone is an unlocked samsung so you have to buy a bring your own sim kit which is then bucks and change transfer was quick and easy. Phone works great.

"1020","I really love this cell smooth scrolling awesome pics great battery life and wireless charging I can't complain..
            "
"1021","Probably the best phone I've purchased in a long time. Would definitely recommend to someone looking for an upgrade, especially if they don't want to pay more for similar performance on something like, say, the iPhone X. I almost bought an iPhone, and after looking at them both I decided to go with the S9 and I am glad I did. The display is pretty awesome, nice colors, and the storage capacity is great, as well as the added benefit of adding an sd card for extra memory. The speed of the phone is high, even if you have a lot of apps open, probably due to the 4 gb ram. Superb performance overall. Impressed me for sure.
            "
"1022","I bought a samsung galaxy s9+. At the second month in the phone appear a message about moisture inside even I did not put inside the water. It does not permit me to charge the phone by cable. How it is possible if the phone supouse has a IP68 certification. And when I try to make the refund there are a lot of inconvenients because I live in other country.
            "

            "
"1026","I upgraded from the s5, and I can tell you that the phone is the best phone on the market currently. I've been a loyal Samsung customer for years, and when I hold a phone for long term use I really keep it until something is worth purchasing. Where the iPhone lacks the S9 Plus makes up for. The Ram, expandable storage option of 400 GB's, and beautiful display, & somewhat ok price(the more advance the more expensive technology will be) places the phone already ahead of many phone companies. Samsung truly improved upon the phone, and I can say I'm satisfied.
            "

"1043","DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!! Samsung S9 has a useless battery. I can literally see the battery life decreasing right before my eyes. It doesn't last a full 8-5 normal use. That's without any use of videos and Spotify. The phone is fast, amazingly fast. But not worth the money. Def, not worth it.A phone must be able to go through a day without running out of battery. And that's cos I disabled important features, like face and iris recognition.Terrible. If I were you, i'd stay away from it.

Very disappointed with that so do your research and find out what Samsung says it will do vs. what it will really do if not purchased from your provider.

"1061","I purchased the lilac purple phone Sunday afternoon and it was delivered Monday morning. The phone was new, no damages as others have talked about , with all parts and accessories included like you would get if you purchased it from Samsung.com. I also chose the bundle which included a 128 GB mini SD card as well as a Fast Wireless Charger stand. The bundle was at no extra cost so the price was $839 plus tax. Great deal if you ask me.  I am coming from a Samsung Note 8 and there are minor upgrades from the Note 8 but those minor upgrades was worth me buying the S9+ . The phone is snappy, the sound due to the dual speakers makes a world of a difference. The camera is better than my Note 8 and the AR emojis are fun. Once the Note 9 comes out, I will be sure to compare that against the S9+ but in the mean time, I will switch between this S9+ and my Note 8 as my daily driver. (Its something about the S pen on my Note 8 that I can not let go. Great phone. I would reccomend this device.
            "
"1062","I love the phone, but it had a Nick in the finger print scanner straight out of the box. The past 3 phones I've had have been from Samsung and I've never had this problem. I would give it 5 stars but, I can't pay this much for a phone and expect a scratch here or paint missing there.
            "
"1063","I received this phone and out of the box, I felt it would be a hard phone to keep a hold of if your hands are damp. I also had some issues within the on screen keyboard. I did like the fact that you could tel the phone to play a notification tone while on a call. I also like the fact you could turn off the call connected/disconnected tones.The phone also has some other things I just can't live with. The phone would play a notification tone whenever I would connect an Bluetooth keyboard and or a hard wired keyboard to it. I couldn't find a way to turn that off. I contacted Samsung and they told me that is just the way the phone works and there wasn't a way to turn that off. US customer service from Samsung in my thoughts is lacking at best.I also got the Notification tones when I turned on/off the Voice Assistant for blind people to use the phone. Thhen on top of that, when using the voice assistant, I couldn't get the caller ID to repete it would only say it once and that was it. I tried quite a few caller ID programs and none of them worked when using a Bluetooth headset to get the caller ID to speak every 5 seconds or so. Without a headset connected by Bluetooth, they worked.The finger commands for there voice assistant for the most part don't work while on a call. Example: if I'm not on a call with voice assistant running, I could triple tap with two fingers and get status information like for time, network, WiFi etc... While on a call it says nothing. Same way with a lot of the other commands they don't work.To me for a blind person, I would stay away from this phone as the way it currently is.

"1070","In Mobile Networks, under APN, it says Tracfone reseller!  For this price, I did not want a reburbished phone. Not only thiat, but the MMS messages do not come through and I can't for the life of me,  find out how to write a message...I'm sure that's something I've overlooked though...All in all, I loved my Galaxy s5.  If I could find a way of charging the battery, I'd continue using it, but the prongs are all screwed up...Don't get me wrong, I guess this is a beautiful phone and all for techies, but It doesn't do what my old phone did. I wish I could find a NEW galaxy s5. but i'm sure they're all refurbished too.  I'm just really disappointed. A lot of the features just don'[t work on my phone...Not worth almost a 1000.

The s5 as it received updates it would run slower and the battery life would barely last 4 hours after 1 year. I have now had my s9 for 4 months and it is starting to go down the same path. The worse part is I try to refuse the updates but now Samsung forces them upon you. I contacted them for help and all they said was we recommend you do them and then nothing more. I bought an Android because I thought I would have freedom of software use and to refuse updates, that is no longer the case. Next phone will be an apple iPhone where you can refuse updates and they have better privacy protection.
            "
"1085","I have now purchased 2 - one right after the other. Not from here. The litany of problems - and I will have to summarize...1. battery died to 3% first day. No gaming. No nothing, except talking for a couple of hours and taking a few pictures. Truly.  2.) Ringtones would not work for texting, UNLESS I was talking on the phone. This was before the Master REset.  Otherwise, I just got the vibration and ""aaagh). Again. It was nothing I had done or not done.  Called Carrier - again - Consumer Cellular - and was told to do something you could not do to this phone - hard shock - was told to take it to Target. I did not get it from Target. Got a Supervisor - we did a Master Reset. After that, I could not even use it as a phone. No texting. No phone calls.#2 phone. Messes with my files. Ringtones won't work with texting - unless I'm talking -  the battery bleeds like nobody's business. I don't game. I don't bank. I just got the bloody thing because my J7 went bad... and I wanted a larger screen.  This thing tells me that the ""badges"" will show with I receive a message or phone notification. They don't. Again, not my bad. This is BEYOND glitchy.Don't Do It.

"1086","Beware, this unlocked phone does not have advanced calling or video calling capability.  Went from a S7 to this S9 & went backwards in features.  The seller info should declare these deficiencies in their sales pitch.

"1087","Pros:Everything an expensive phone should have (great camera, display, sound, processing speed, etc)Headphone Jack!Micro SD slot (memory expandable up to 400gb)!Available for pretty much any carrier I can think of in the USA (unlike other great phones like the One Six Plus)Android OS so more options for those of us that like to mess with devices (and lots of great apps not available on iOS)Very good looking phoneSuper fast data usageSuper fast fingerprint unlock""Mehs"":Battery lifekeyboard a tad laggy imo (can be improved or even changed if you mess around)Bixby (has soo much potential, but it kinda sucks rn, and that bixby button... WHY)A few apps should have a bit more optimization when compared to iOSAR Animoji isn't as good as the iPhone X's version (I mean, idc; but some might lol)Face recognition is meh compared to the iPhone X'sCons:PRICE... This, and the iPhone 8 and X are too expensive... I still bought it, but still... (if you're tight on money, buy an S8 or different new good android phone. And if you're really tight, buy a good used S something or sort of recent iPhone)Fragile, had to buy a case and screen protector day oneLike 2 bloatware apps but you CAN remove them thankfullyOverall, I don't think I'll ever pay 800+ for a phone again even though I keep mine for three years before I replace; I'd rather do something better with that money. However, it's a damn good phone and I do recommend it if you keep your phones for a while or you're someone that needs the best phone every year. Compared to the X that some of my friends have, this phone is better imo. The X does do a few things better, but I still personally prefer the S9. Coming from an iPhone 5s, it's obviously a HUGE leap for me in terms of phones lol. If you're like me and want to try Android rather than going back to iOS, buy a good phone like this one (or the Huawai P20 PRO, One Six Plus, basically a good android phone) and you won't regret it. Will I stay with android and/or Samsung in three years? I don't know, but if things keep getting better as they are right now for android, I sure damn will. :)

"1088","I had an iphone X but I sold it for this. The iphone x was a huge disappointment. I used to buy nothing but apple products, but I realized how far behind apple is. This phone has a much larger display and higher quality than the x. Plus there is no annoying top notch at the top. The camera is better, I took pictures on both phones and the samsung was the only phone to pick up the fine print from a picture on my wall standing 12 ft away. The iphone x was blurry and the print wasn't legible. This phone has an incredible aperture to take crisp pictures even in low light. I don't believe its oversaturated, it all depends on what area of the screen you tap on and the phone will adjust the colors accordingly. Overall this phone probably has one of the best cameras on the market.The specs are good, you'll be able to multitask without any issues.The battery life is about average for me, it's not as much as I would like but it's not terrible either. I use my phone a lot for business, emails, video etc.. it gets me through the majority of my working hours around 7 hours of on screen time.Coming from an iphone user this is much better!

"1089","Samsung does not care about customer satisfaction. For them customer-centric culture is a very foreign idea.  This is my experience. I will never buy Samsung electronic device again and will convince all my friends and family to avoid that trainwreck also.Bought this phone new in July 2018, at Best Buy. Phone started to act up couple months later, not taking up the charge, finally turning into a brick. And since then it was a road through hell of Samsung (questionable) quality and dealing with the worst customer service I have ever encountered... It is unbelievable, because I expected Samsung to be on par with Apple, but boy, am I disappointed!So - it has essentially been the following cycle: would not take charge -- repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - - repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - - repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - then I finally decided to call customer service again, but demanding refund, being fed up with this whole brand altogether. It's been quite a ride with those guys, too! It took them first a few days to reply, oh sorry, I take it back - to do nothing, then I called last Friday (12/07) demanding refund again. Then I was told 48 hrs for decision. Then nothing, so I called Wednesday, after 72 hours and was escalated to someone else who told me it is up to five days, so I need to wait until Friday 12/14 (today) and they'd call me with the decision. So I waited till Friday's late afternoon because - of course - nobody called, and after being elevated again, spending about 2 hr and demanding information, I was told the phone cannot be refunded, not even exchanged! Only repaired again (because they have policies that say that main board has to be replaced). Next week I was supposed to get this phone on an international trip. Now I am stranded without one, I just haven't got some $700's around to buy new phones anytime I feel for it.It is unbelievable that they have some unrealistic policies and it does not matter that phone breaks 4 times (the same thing) and they would not replace it, let alone refund it, cause ""it wasn't motherboard"". My communications with even 2nd level manager was just as that - pointless. Banging my head against the wall of some corporate baloney - rather than being cared about as a customer who does genuinely get hit by their product poor quality.GO FOR iPHONE INSTEAD!!!  Maybe the phones aren't Androids but at least they have some true customer service out there!

"1090","I have owned Apple products for over 10 years now and loved them at the beginning. I thought I would never switch to another product, but with the increasing price and little new innovation on the new products I decided to try a new product. I came across Samsung and after much research I decided to try them out. I got the Galaxy S9 and all I can say is WOW! The camera is amazing I can take high quality pictures and adjust the lighting to fit the background, the battery life lasts forever I go 2 days minimum without having to charge it and I am on it constantly. The Face ID and fingerprint are great, I can even use the Face ID in pitch dark and it works! Storage is unbelievable I store over 7k pictures and still have room for apps and lots of contacts! Overall this is such a great phone I can honestly say I will never go back to Apple.
            "
"1091","Great phone. No problem there. Problem is that this particular phone from this particular vender is a Sprint phone and will not work to full capacity on Verizon network. In particular, the voicemail icon for Verizon does not work on this phone. There is no icon for voicemail.  I called Verizon about it and they said that since the phone was made as a Sprint phone, there is nothing they can do about it. In trying to help me out, Verizon told me that they could not do a shared screen process to figure out the problem. I am not willing to spend this much money on a phone with so much potential only to discover that the phone was made for the wrong company by whom I receive service.  I will be returning this phone to get a Verizon compatible phone.
            "
"1092","Had problems activating it through Verizon but finally got it.  Great camera.  Pretty much the same as a  S8 with a few cool upgrades.
            "
"1093","If you've already used or owned an S8, the S9 is going to be a very familiar device.  Same-fish design, same glorious Samoled display, same 18.5:9 aspect ratio, etc. Dont expect a drastic change from the S8 going to this phone.However, there are improvements such as a dual aperture camera, which isn't an apparent change at first until you dive into pro mode, a stereo speaker setup with the earpiece finally playing media when watching videos or playing games, and a better fingerprint sensor location. The bottom chin of the phone is also a bit smaller than it is on the S8 so there's a little asymmetricism going on when you rotate the phone sideways but hey, no dumb notch right? Samsung's skin is still drastically different from Google's vision of Android but serious work done with the s8 to improve performance is still present and I actually prefer the aesthetics of Samsung Experience, the new name of the software skin compared to stock vanilla android Oreo.Only downsides I can see are still average battery life and the general use of gorilla glass 5, which is more shatter resistant but quite a bit easier to scratch. There's two or three microscratches along the front glass though it's just the oleophobic coating and it's nowhere near the sensors, not to mention it's hard to see. That might just be me though as I'm rockin' the phone naked. Curved glass is also pretty much just for aesthetics and having an option to not have them or at least just have small curved edges would be more preferable but not a big issue for me.Either way, the S9 is a definite option to consider if you're planning to upgrade to a new phone anytime soon.EDIT: added more photos
            "
"1094","I bought 2 Samsung Galaxy S9 back in March from Samsung.com.My first issue was when they charged me for my exchanged S7 device that they claimed had physical damage but from the pictures they provided showed nothing more than normal wear. Calling and calling did no good to get anything done and just run around in circles.  They couldn't even provide the IMEI of the returned device to prove it was even the one that I sent to them.I went to sell my Samsung Galaxy S9 because I was so mad from this experience.  I sold the phones that should have been unlocked since I paid full price for the phones.  But the phones were locked to T-Mobile and T-Mobile couldn't unlock them.  I called Samsung and they couldn't unlock the phones either sending me in circles.  I asked the reps why they would send me a phone I paid full price for locked and why they wouldn't unlock the phone.Samsung has the worst customer service and I highly recommend getting a Google Pixel or another Android device.
            "
"1095","S9 could be a wonderful phone but the OS sucks at this point. Phone OS traps you in delete mode for both messages and email, only way out is shutting the phone down and repowering up, at least once a day. Additionally phone comes bloated with google everything with permissions for way too much. Settings are multi layered and manual is useless, eventually you can modify settings to meet your needs, if you do not it is setup to eat battery power, and data at amazingly high rates. If they can get the delete traps fixed then the phone would be acceptable or maybe amazing, can¡¯t see that yet. Maybe after they do some more fixes. I have had two system upgrades so far..... hoping for some sanity and stability soon..... please
            "
"1096","I gave it 4 stars because there is no perfect phone, if there was they wouldn¡¯t need to keep creating new models. I purchased mine elsewhere but exact same model and love the slim design. I¡¯m comparing it with my present iPhone 7+. I¡¯ve only had the Samsung 9 for 7 hrs but it¡¯s definitely top quality. However, I paid $600 but got a $200 rebate from a little known and new website called invisible dot com.  It gets better, their plan is unlimited and on Verizon, and truly unlimited, and no data threshold where it throttles down. It starts and stays at 5mbps the entire time period but it¡¯s great for streaming HD and works as a hotspot. Lastly make sure you buy a radiation proof cover not just an RFID one, the radiation from 4G is proving to cause tumors  especially with Bluetooth earpiece and 5G is even worse, lookit up.
            "
"1097","The S9 Plus is nearly as silly as the Iphone. Samsung has managed to make an impractical phone that looks sexy. For starters, the battery is glued in! Three replacement batteries kept my old S5 alive for many years. Now I'm looking at $100 to replace the battery in the S9 Plus. Ouch!What's with those curved edges! My screen already has a couple of scratches and I still can't find a screen protector that doesn't piss me off. At this rate, I'm going to need another phone in 6 months... but perhaps that's what Samsung is hoping.It's not all about length; it's how you use it! When holding the S5 in one hand, my thumb doesn't reach to the top of the screen; it's now a two-handed device. Plus (pun intended), it's too long for my jeans pocket and it jabs into me when I bend at the waist.It takes great pictures. Other than that, I'm missing my S5.
            "
"1098","I decided to move to Android after 5+ years with Apple. Main reason I bought the s9+ was the camera.You can get along with the Android way of doing things, but what really pissed me of was when I tried to backup the photos I took in my Macbook.Actually I have *returned* this phone after struggling an entire day searching an easy way to backup pictures on my Mac.After trying 5 different apps (including some weirdo chinese apps), trying with an SD card and everything, it was clear to me that this phone integration with a Macbook was a big NO for me. Oh, did I mention that some of the files got corrupted when I moved from internal storage to Micro SD?
            "
"1099","Pro:Fingerprint sensor works like a charm.The quality of the photos is beyond top notch.The phone fits well in my hand and doesn't feel bulky.It comes with plenty of storage, which can be expanded with SD cards.Price range won't break the bank and gives you a quality phone.Cons:Get a case for it. The back of the phone can get marked up rather easily.The battery drains annoyingly quick, Even with battery saver options on. It's the biggest and only real flaw of the phone and I wish the battery saver options were a bit more open to allow you to pick and choose what you want to do.Overall, I enjoy the phone and if having a longer battery life is a must then I'd recommend getting the S9 Plus because the battery life is quite a bit better. Other than that, It's everything I want in a phone.
            "
"1100","Never have I ""Hated"" a phone. However, Samsung has made that happen.Between the annoying Bixpy, that always pops up and can not be deleted.....to the Annoying home button, constantly being pressed when navigating pages that have button presses at bottom of screen.....to the beveled ""edge"" glass that has cracked 3 times, due to cases not being able to protect it....finally, the battery life is weak compared to my son's motorolla and wife's pixel!No thanks, on the S9 series!
            "
"1101","After receiving the phone i tried to activate through sprint and it wouldnt work by using my current sd card. Went to the sprint store and bought a new one. Still didnt work. Went on sprints website and typed it the imei number and it stated it will work on the sprint network. Called customer service and gave them the iemi and they shipped me out a new sim card. Called to activate the new sim card and it works now ! So my suggestion is call sprint give them the iemi number and send u out a sim. Other than that the phone is nice however the camera is super dark when trying to use superslowmo
            "
"1102","This is a great phone with a lot of cool features and a top-notch camera, but I could do without Bixby and the overwhelming number of useless apps on it.  In addition, price-wise, it is not exponentially better (10X) than the BlackBerry Z10 that I switched over from and suffers from the following issues that take it down a notch:-Google Play doesn't download the album art if you transfer music over from your computer. It's not the end of the world, but the Z10 wasn't missing any album covers in its library.  I downloaded a pay-for-play music player and pushed Google Play to the next page because I wanted whatever album art I could get.  Without it, I find it kind of bland.-I am astounded as to why e-mails, phone calls and texts are all in different places. The S9+ should have a hub ""stream"", similar to the Z10.  I found that I needed to download the BlackBerry Hub for Android feature because it provides the user with one stream of e-mails, phone calls and text messages.  BlackBerry Hub for Android is the best thing since sliced bread and it is available either free (without ads for 30 days and with ads after that), and 99 cents a month (without ads), thereafter. From the human factors perspective, this is something that Samsung should be offering, especially at its advanced rate of development.-When a calendar event opens, there's no option to ""snooze"".-Playing music with earbuds was a little disappointing. The BlackBerry Z10 had a built-in optional booster and the sound quality was much better with richer bass, even with a $10 pair of earbuds.  The S9+ DOES have very good speaker sound, though.I bought this phone because I thought it was time to upgrade to an Android-based device that could run more apps, especially from the proprietary BlackBerry O/S that is going or gone extinct.  The S9+ is a very nice phone, but it is a little lacking and not flawless.  I am one that will probably not use it to play Pokemon or for any gaming.  The core features I use it for are phone, e-mail, music and some Android apps.  It's nice having a phone that can do the latter, but it would also be nice to have the best of both worlds.

"1103","Nice phone/camera but it is a super slippery fragile fingerprint magnet.  Case was late from Amazon, slipped out of my pocket18 inches off ground and the screen cracked.  Weak.  I like my Note 4 better.  Bit of buyer's remorse for me.

"1104","Like many products these days it's all about the marketing and hype.  I've had the phone now for over a month.Pros:Speakers are loud and clearHeadphone amp is 1.4x more powerfulSome interesting tweaks in audio for Dolby Atmos, tube amp, etc.Display is outstandingCons:Bixby button is an annoyance. The placement is such when you use the power button you hit the Bixby button which IMO is a useless feature.Samsung bloatware.  Knox, Samsung music, gallery, etc. Compared to Google and what's on play I just want to delete them but can't.OS updates!  The half-hearted joke is if you want an updated OS, buy a new phone.  This includes security updates.Samsung should concentrate their efforts on updating the OS and security and forgo the lousy Samsung apps.Would I recommend the phone.  That depends.  If you love audio, then yes this is a good choice.  If you want updated software, speed and smooth opertation I would look elsewhere.

"1105","Very good phone but i give only 4 stars because there is no IR port. Even my old chineese phone had one ! i used it to control my air conditioner.
            "
"1106","Literally the best phone I've ever had, I loved it so much I decided to upgrade to the S9 Plus version. Here's my layman's review on both.PROs:- The night photos are where this phone shines, definitely able to get every detail possible in low lighting.- Battery life is massive with both phone: S9 has a 3000mAh / S9 Plus 3500mAh- Plenty of RAM: S9 has 4gigs/ S9 Plus 6gigs. Both perform very extremely well but 6 gigs worth of RAM seems like overkill as 4 gigs from the S9 suffice with little to no slowdowns.-  Headphone jack on both version. Also comes with some sweet AKG earbuds.- AR emoji is relatively fun and great to show to people interested in checking out the phone- Thin phone- 4k Video quality- Great Speakers- Samsung Pay, literally can be used anywhere that accepts Cards as it mimics the magnetic strip (Not like Google Pay that relies on the ereader).- Live Translations with Bixby Vision- (Plus Version)  Live photo mode. Really great feature, and editable-  (Plus version) 2 Rear Cameras with optical zoom at 2x and digital at 10x, and dual captureCONs:- While night photos are amazing, daytime photos can sometimes appear overly saturated.- There isn't a noticeable size difference between both phones.- What is the point of Bixby? Really difficult to incorporate it into my daily life without actively thinking ""I should give Bixby a try""- While thin, it's somewhat heavy.- Besides the camera, there isn't a massive difference between S9 and S9 Plus.VERDICT:As stated above, I love the S9 so much I upgraded to the Plus version. Both phones run extremely fast with little to no slowdown, even having several apps open does little to bog it's performance down. Photos look fantastic at especially at night with both versions. My only issue is the new Bixby button: it's not something I would actively use but at least users can disable this feature. Overall it's a lovely phone, S9 works just as well as the S9 Plus but lacking a few features with the camera.
            "
"1107","The camera will not autofocus on my S9, and it's been a known problem since it came out early this year. Still no resolution except ""send it back to the factory"". Wish I had known this before I bought it.
            "
"1108","Phone frequently starts talking out loud (even if in your pocket or bag) because the dedicated had button pushes up against something. You can follow on-line instructions to disable the voice talking, but every time the phone auto-updates the operating system (which is forced upon you), the ""Bixby voice assistant"" is reverted to default mode. So, phone starts talking out loud at random times again.Do EVERYTHING you can do to avoid this phone. Do NOT buy any phone with ""Bixby"" associated with it. Samsung thinks it's smarter than you, so they took away your ability to disable the voice thing permanently, and they made it impossible to re-purpose the additional button for anything. Total garbage.

"1109","This is a typical Samsung Flagship phone. It is well built and feels premium on hand. The picture quality is great. Shoots even better in low light. This phone has A LOT of features and can be quite complex. Blue Light filter, Dolby Atmos, Edge light, Always on and more. I am a simple guy and have never found these features useful. But slowly I started playing with them. Definitely useful but not must have.Why did I give 3 stars?Too much Samsung bloatware and the Bixby button is hell of annoying. The fingerprint and face recognition are not reliable. Face recognition rare works. The phone battery tends to die over night in standby mode if I only have 10% left.--Update after a year--The battery is horrible. Barely getting 2-3 hours on screen a day. I had to charge 2-3 times a day. Not going to buy a Samsung again.
            "
"1110","I got my phone from Verizon, but I am reviewing it here since it is the same phone. The Samsung Galaxy S9 is overall a great quality phone. Sometimes I won't get a notification for text messages and I have some problems with the screen. I got a screen protector for this phone and I found that it lifted up on the sides due to the curved screen. This caused dirt to get under it and the screen has a hard time processing touch through a screen protector. I took that off and now my fingerprints get ALL OVER the screen. More than normal. That would be fine if I could wipe them off, but they stick into the screen. (I never touch my phone before washing my hands after eating if that helps) No matter how hard I wipe (with a glasses cleaning cloth) they won't come out. Everything else about the phone is outstanding though and greatly surpasses the competition. Even with these problems it is a way better option than the iPhone X. Better camera and battery life!

"1112","The phone was great since i had upgraded from the s7 but the screen seems to be very fragile in my case the phone screen cracked while being in my pocket and protected by tempered glass and a phone case after this i called my insurance and they sent me back a new phone for a deductible of $200 the new phone broke in the same way as the first one in less than a week although this one was not protected by tempered glass after seeing booth had broken in less then a month i contacted samsung customer support something I would never do again since all they did was waste my time I was told I had to send my phone to be inspected and they would repair under warrantty. I sent my phone to them and it arrived at their facility two days later. After 10 days I had not received any information from samsung so I decided to call. When I called I was informed the phone was processing and I would recieve it in 5 buisness days, later that day I finally recieved notification they had my phone processing and it would be ready soon. Now 2 days ago I recieved a bill for repair costs of 247.89 way more than my deductible because my phone was not covered by warranty.

"1113","I purchased this phone as an ""upgrade"" to my wife's Google Pixel phone. (Actually my son got her Phone when his HTC M8 died.) Anyway, it's the second worst phone she's owned - and we have to go all the way back to the Motorola Photon to beat the miserable user experience provided by the Samsung Galaxy S9. As usual, Samsung has placed the albatross of bloatware heavily upon the otherwise promising hardware. I'd root it in a minute if she'd let me.

"1114","Don't buy!!  Two things are good... the touted good camera and processor speed. Sound is marginal and maybe worse than previous issues.  It is NARROW, terribly so such that 1/3 of my time is spent correcting misspelled words no matter what keyboard I try. Yes typing on the horizontal position is ok, but awkward and you have to use 2 hands. Samsung dropped individual text notices and so now EVERYTHING sounds the same when notified making you pull out the phone, unlock it, then find out what the notice was for... drivel!! At least weekly I have to restart the phone for the dail numbers to work, otherwise it does not put calls and texts through. The screen touch is over desensitized with a screen protector sometimes requiring multi-touches to respond even when in the sensitive mode.  It reminds me of Microsoft's Mellium PC format.
            "
"1115","The Galaxy S9 is a great looking and working phone, but I challenge you to try to figure out all the camera features they show in the commercial.They show all sorts of things like 'swing' and 'boomerang'  and 'super slo-mo', but the only feature I can actually find is the slo-mo.  The other features are buried somewhere in the camera and Samsung provides ZERO instructions on how to use them.I'm currently scouring the internet to see how to activate these features, but it is a major fail for Samsung for not providing guidance in the box.

Will never buy Samsung again.

Starting to happen more often and of course I'm a day late for returning it. NO GOODUpdate... ubreakifix did the repair on the camera. It was a hassle, but it works. The shop owner told me what a hassle it is working with Samsung, I'm just glad that I didn't have to mail it in for the warranty.

"1118","I love EVERYTHING about this phone, except for one thing. The BATTERY drains way faster than all my previous phones. I've used the iPhone X before to play Fortnite and the battery on the iPhone X didn't drain as fast as this phone does. It might be that Fortnite isn't optimized for android or something, I don't know. I've also played a lot of Asphalt 9 on this phone and the battery drains quickly too. I recommend getting this phone still, if you're not worried about the battery. This phone has a excellent camera, although the Google Pixel 2 XL excels in some areas. A nice feature about the camera is that you can change the aperture. The screen on this phone is the best! The screen is so beautiful and HQ! I took my iPhone 7 Plus out to compare and I just notice the ugly bezels on the iPhone screen. I don't think I can use phones with bezels again after using this amazing phone! The phone is very fast, of course with a Snapdragon 845, you can expect it to do anything. Runs Fortnite perfectly fine if you want this phone to play Fortnite. Multitasking is very easy. All in all it's a great phone, worth every single penny you've spent. If you don't care about the battery life, this is the perfect phone for you.

"1120","Good phone and camera, however tons of bloatware clogging everything (cpu, ram, sd card), not up to date Android version (8.0), very slow on safety relevant updates. Bixby is the worst, you need an app to block this useless crap. All in all good phone if Samsung would just listen to customers.

"1121","The Galaxy S9 is Samsung's 2018 flagship phone that currently runs on Android's latest version. This device is powered by Qualcomm's 2018 845 processor. There is a headphone jack and a USB C port that charges the phone from 0% to 100% in 1 hour and 45 min. The phone has 3 buttons: a power button, a volume control button, and Samsung Bixby (voice assistant) button. One of the biggest changes from the S8 is the camera. The S9+ has a dual camera that performs well in low light. Some of the camera modes include auto, video, hyperlapse, super slo-mo, and food. The camera produces amazing images and 4k 60 fps video. For unlocking the phone you can use a pin, password, pattern, fingerprint, iris, or face. The phone has wireless charging that allows you to lay the phone on a pad without plugging it in. The curved screen on this phone is phenomenal. One interesting inclusion to the phone is a heart rate monitor that is next to the camera. This can be used in the Samsung Health app. The phone is thin and light and has a great feel. Samsung has done a great job with the S9. The S9 is a great price phone that I highly recommend.

"1122","After doing a fair bit of research I am pretty sure that many phones people are getting are fake Chinese knock offs. I would not recommend taking the chance on this. They look similar but there are subtle differences that say these are fakes.

"1123","When I first bought the Galaxy S9 (thru Xfinity Mobile), I was very much impressed with its graphics, camera, and just overall sleek design. The OS is very responsive and easily adaptable. And for its price, I find it to be a great quality phone. Unfortunately, if I couldve done things differently, I would've bought an S8. It seems, that as a new model, there are still kinks that Samsung needs to work out.The battery is VERY WEAK. It doesn't even last half a day (12 hours) with moderate use. Also, the design can sometimes make the phone screen very easily crackable because of the raised edges (the phone case that I had bought could not protect the phone when it fell to the ground).

Best experience so far.

I didn't have it delivered but it's an awesome device!!!

"1126","I had a Galaxy S7 ans Iphone 8 and purchased both a Galaxy S9 and S9+ ... The camera on the Samsung destroys all of Apple's product offerings. That was one of the main reasons in getting the phone. I still think the Apple OS is far superior to Android, and there are glitches galore. turned off all notifications but still can get an app or two which will notify even when do not disturb is put on. Here is the odd thing, the S9 that I have seems to preform much faster and have a better camera than the s9+ on several occasions I used both and there was a huge difference in speed and pic quality. I would take the S9 over the S9+ screen seems sharper and the larger size is not worth is, horrible Bixby feature! My Galaxy S7 made me a Samsung Customer, the S9 is making the Apple 8 seem more appealing and I prefer the aspect ratio of the screen on the apple. Speakers are better on the Galaxy. For the price through, the Apple is the better phone except for the camera.

"1128","I went for ""premium"" by getting an S9+, but am rather disappointed.  First, there's huge amounts of bloatware.  I ended up disabling over 200 packages on the device that I didn't need/want.  Then, I couldn't ""root"" it.  Hey, it's my device; I should be able to do whatever I want with it including putting on a custom ROM.  The curved screen is actually a negative - I can't get a good screen protector for it.  Finally, the S9+ screen is actually smaller than the Nexus 6P I had before.  Going back to a Google phone next time.  I loved them in the past, and am kicking myself for changing.
            "
"1129","Lets start with the positives. It's fast, its responsive, the camera is good, ample storage and USB-C. Also has a headphone jack which is sadly scarce in 2018Now the negatives. The biggest one is the rounded edges of the display (and the reason why I will probably be selling this phone). they make it impossible to hold the phone with one hand, as it will ALWAYS detect your palm as an imput and mess up the touch sensors. It also gives a warping effect for any video being watched, so the edges are always deformed. Also this screen scratches way too easy, I have only had it since April and the screen is already scratched to the point where its intrusive. Had a note 5 since launch day and it had not a single scratch on the screen, vs this which was getting scratches within a few days of getting it.Now lets talk about bixby and the bixby button. Bixby is a waste of space, as the original siri worked better. Not to mention google assistant also is on the device, which works a lot better. Now when I tried to bind google assistant to the bixby button, but this is the next issue, you can't remap the DEDICATED HARDWARE BUTTON. I thought samsung would of learned from the S8 reviews, but I guess they didn't. Don't worry, they made it to where you're able to ""disable the bixby button"" where basically it puts it on a 3 second press rather than a tap, and otherwise remains active.Now for just some things that don't classify as ""negatives"" but I just personally don't like. The 18:9 or properly called 2:1 just seems weird, and it pushes the top buttons a little too high for convenient use I have decently large hands but still finding myself straining my thumb to hit drop down menus or open notifications. Also 99% of video content is 16:9 or 21:9, making 18:9 weird for bothI also prefer the dedicated hardware buttons of the older galaxies, as you either hide them, which means in order to have a home button you need to swipe up. It is always popping up rather than having me scroll when I swipe up, which gets incredibly annoying extremely quickly. The other option is to lock the buttons to the screen, which just makes no sense, as not only do you waste battery powering them (since they are white with a light gray background), but you also get burn-in since its an oled display. Also at that point whats the point in onscreen buttons, you could just have physical buttons that work better and allow front fingerprint scanners.All in all there are some very strong positives about the phone, but they get completely outweighed by the negatives imo.

I searched the many reviews for this item and I didn't see anyone else mention this problem, so maybe my phone was an anomaly for not having the sim card tray.

Yeah, we put a screen there that serves no purpose other than to click things when your just trying to hold onto your phone.

"1157","Quite possibly the worst bloatwear in a flagship phone, coming from a google pixel this phone has been nothing but issues. The SmartSwitch app took 6 seperate times to finally run. If you like wasting time then this is the phone for you, if not look at a pixel or even the OnePlus.

"1168","Back in March, I switched from an LG V20 to the S9+ because the screen on my LG began to bleed through. Big mistake. The Samsung pales in comparison to the LG. There's no tap or knock to wake option, the fingerprint sensor is finicky, scrolling through social media is a chore and I found myself growing more and more aggravated with daily use. In short, I paid the phone off early. When I was in the store explaining at how dissatisfied I was with the phone, a Samsung representative was present.  Upon overhearing my gripes, he just said something about not pleasing everyone. While that's true and there is no perfect phone, Samsung sure has some catching up to do with LG.  Much better User Interface on LG and the fingerprint sensor isn't as finicky.  Do yourself a favor and check out the V30 or the G7.  Skip the S9+

"1178","Recently upgraded from the S7 to the S9+ and I'm terribly disappointed. Last week, I decided to upgrade from a Samsung S7 to a Samsung S9+. I even went all in with the BOGO deal from Verizon and upgraded Junior at the same time.Rarely have I been so disappointed in a tech purchase! And Samsung, I hope you have people watching for this sort of post. I'll be RETURNING. THIS. PHONE. tomorrow. Major shortcomings include ""Bixby,"" microphone placement, and voice recognition.First, the ""Bixby"" personal assistant is a train wreck. I don't know who decided that an unholy union of the Yahoo! home page and Google Assistant was a good idea, but they seriously missed the mark. And it CAN'T. BE. DISABLED. Nothing enrages me more than software bundles that can't be disabled.Second, you have to hold the phone in your hand to be able to talk on the speakerphone, or the microphone is muffled and useless. Seriously, Samsung?! the whole point of the speakerphone function is to be able to put the phone down.Thirdly--and this is the deal killer for me--the voice recognition for talk-to-text, voice dialing, and talk-to-email is just abysmal. These features worked nearly flawlessly on my S7, but on the S9+ I'm flying into daily rages over the garbled nonsense the phone ""hears"" when I talk to it. I have no accent and enunciate very clearly and it does no good. Even if I shout single words and go completely over the top on my enunciation, I can't send a single text message of the simplest imaginable words. I spend 50-60 hours per week driving and MUST be able to communicate hands free as much as technologically possible.Swing and a resounding miss, Samsung.

If you really want to see the camera fail, take it out to a trail in the woods and film there. I guarantee you it won't record at 60fps, but instead something like 51fps!

On a positive note, it's got a nice camera. This phone is a great piece of hardware with terrible software. I'm excited for my one year lease to expire so I can get another iPhone.

"1222","They had a chance to fix all the laggy, unusable ¡°features¡±. Another forced Bixby (it insists upon itself). I have both this and the iPhone X. Surprise, guess which one just works out of the box (SPOILER ALERT: iPhone). I was so excited about this phone, but it has maybe a (marginally) better camera setup than the S8+. It¡¯s at least as laggy as the last phone. It¡¯s not worth the price, flagship or not. If you¡¯re OS agnostic, get an iPhone. This is way more trouble than it¡¯s worth. It arrives bloated and you can do nothing about it.Also, in typical Android fashion, you get a less and less responsive device as time goes on. Every app you install makes the phone that much slower. This is an Android problem, same thing happens on the Pixel 2 XL. I should have stuck with the Pixel which is uglier, but not full of bloat.It has a nice screen though, but I like the iPhone¡¯s screen as much. This is hardly an upgrade, but another disappointment from Samsung. Maybe it¡¯ll catch fire like the Note and I¡¯ll be able to be rid of this phone.

"1223","This phone surpasses any iPhone currently and previously on the market. I bought it as a second phone just to use for posting pictures for my real estate business. I would take it over IOS any day if it wasn't for the battery Life. You would have more luck using a sidekick from 2005 plugged into a potato to hold a better charge than this phone. The note 7 (which I also owned) blew up and this one just dies after 30 minutes of use. If you can charge it for three hours to use the camera it a great.. other than that you get a ""battery too low to use flash"" message. After missing tens of important business calls and overall not being able to use the device due to its 45 minute battery life i am switching fully back to iPhone.

"1224","With use of a case, the phone cannot sustain a fall of 42 inches. The glass will crack.If you don't want to pay for half the phone to fix small cracks, you can try repairing it yourself and break all internal components, when you fail, Samsung will refuse to repair it, even though you are offering them money.So, if you have a 100% chance of not dropping the phone...

            "
"1233","I recieved the wrong color. :(
            "
"1234","I am completely perplexed that this thing has such bad notifications.I use LG, Pixel and Iphone, saw it all, and had reasons to abandon Samsung long time ago. Every cheap LG just worked better than Samsung for me.Decided to try S9  due it's small size; the only other option was Google Pixel but its display is just too bad. The only thing worse than the display are those large bezels, and the need to find and install some 3rd party apps that would allow to auto-hide the soft buttons, when you want to get more out of that abysmal display. Heck, except in Youtube, the buttons are always  there, making that 5"" screen more like 4.5"", in a body that's wider than S9. What a nonsense..Anyway, S9 notifications:No notifications on locked screen:  I have to take it, unlock, swipe down (needs both hands) and then I'll see notifications. Iphone/Pixel/nexus turns on the screen for a few seconds, I can see if it's anything interesting, if not I go with my work, the phone turns off the screen.Limited notifications on locked screen:Shows two lines vs full screen + scroll on iphone. Some settings available that don't help much. Androids in general are not that good as iphone, as they always are trying to bundle notifications. If you try to avoid that, at least they'll be bundled by the app.Raise to wakeup and show notifications:With iphone/Pixel/Nexus, I would pickup the phone and the accelerometar would wake up the phone, showing  notifications. As soon as I put the phone down the screen goes off. When I pickup S9 nothing happens - again unlock and swipe procedure...Notifications while using the phone:Some message comes in, the phone does NOTHING. Sometimes it vibrates, sometimes it sounds, and sometimes it does show the popup.All this regardless of Notification Sounds settings and Silent mode. WTF ?App Icon number:Not reliably cleared or set on Google Inbox, Outlook, Google Play, to name a few.Note: some of these problems are tied to Notification Sound being off. So, they tied together Sound and Visual part of the notification system. Maybe that's good, but it's them who tried to distinguish between Visual and Sound Notifications in  Settings. Naturally, these certainly are two different things as their use model is different.  Samsung knows that but they failed to get it right. It's understandable why they failed - read below about the SW update I got.  Anyway, sometimes some things work for a while (e.g. after I change different options) but then get broken again. Classical Samsung...All in all, I am relying on my Pebble to show me notifications.Some 3rd party apps allow coping with most of these problems but they are unreliable, sometimes power hungry or not persistent. So why Samsung doesn't care ?  Well, just two days into Preorder (I already got my phone) and I get Software Update with important bug fixes. So, these guys are trying to deliver the software with zillion options so naturally it's not yet ready and is full of bugs. They start lots of things, and  rarely nail a single one.First crazy option: Edge screen Notifications. You got to check out that hopeless attempt to implement ... ...i don't know what.Second crazy  option: Turn On screensaver when screen is off. it's screen **saver** for a turned off screen ? WTF ?Third crazy option: Always on screen showing me the clock (duh) and that I have notifications... Sure I DO! I receive about hundred or more different notifications daily. The phone is ALWAYS in front of my face when working and driving - show me the notification, not an icon saying there's one...Fourth crazy option: You can enable vibration when you pickup the phone, if there was some notification. Duh, what about SHOWING that notification.I was thinking working hard getting different 3rd party apps until I fix the notifications to suit my needs. But still, that would leave me with the curved screen;  Curved screen means there are no cases that allow comfortable grip as the case cannot extend fully above the LCD. I find much larger phones more comfortable in my hand - e.g. Samsung's own S8 Active, Pixel 2 XL with a proper case are easier to handle. So, my argument that I should get S9 because it's the smallest premium phone doesn't apply anymore.In addition, curved glass easily breaks as the glass is exposed. So many broken S8 phones around. I hear they've put much better **glass** into S9.  Duh..And not to forget the screen protector - THERE ARE NO GOOD glass screen protectors on the market (yet). I don't know what's wrong but glass protectors requires you to increase the screen sensitivity in the phone settings. Well, that option doesn't work good. I type fast and often use my phone for work email. I can't go and repeat every other letter. Also, glass screen protector, as of today, don't cover the full screen. In fact, they have some glue on the sides for the better grip, actually covering the whole curved edge.All in all, I am returning this one, and will wait to see what LG G7 will look like. Otherwise, will wait for Pixel 3. Until then, iphone 7, with all it's problems, is still a better deal for me than S9.Some notable positive sides:Samsung Internet browser is just awesome.LCD is excellent. Even better after Apple forcefully reduced the LCD brightness on iphone 7-,  to ""help"" aged batteries. Don't know about iphone X, should be also close to 700nits like this one.Starting camera with double click to Power button.Photos *with flash* in dim conditions are ages ahead of the iphone.Home button is there - just press glass a bit harder.Speakerphone is much louder than Iphone 7.---------------------------------------------------------UPDATE on screen wake-up on Notification:Googled a bit to see what can be done. Apparently, people mention that Samsung differs from IOS and stock Android in that you should depend on Edge light, LED light, vibration, sound, but not screen wake-up. So, Samsung tried to be more clever than Google or Apple. Lets see if they succeeded; I google a bit more and there are posts going back to 2015 about different issues:1. Some people actually  LIKE that there are no screen wakeup on Notifications. But their screen is WAKING UP ! S6, S7, S8, S9. People suggested lots of thing but nothing helped those poor souls.2. Some people are like me and would want notification - just can't get them.3. Some people argue why would somebody want to be in Group 2. Duh, what a bunch of schmucks - that should be a configurable option, to satisfy both groups, and no discussion needed.3. Some screenshots show a very promising option in the security settings  - ""Wake Up screen on Notifications"". Well, that seems like it, except that I don't have such option.4. There are reports on all kind of apps that will screw up the notifications. While Googling, a Verizon help page for S9 came up, showing that the screen will not turn on when... Outlook is installed. Aaaargh. I need that one for work. Anyway, after removing it and after doing the factory reset its still the same for me.I am reducing this to one star due to so many bugs. Started with Notifications, but I don't know what else is there...
            "
"1235","I've had many Samsung phones and liked them.  But my most recent phone was an LG V20, which I was also very happy with.  The camera glass cracked after 2 years, and I decided to get another Samsung.  Overall this is a great phone. I wish it was a little larger, so the same screen resolution yielded larger text and icons.  I know I can adjust it, but on the V20 everything's a bit larger at the same resolution, because the usable screen is larger. But if you have good vision at that distance it won't bother you.One complaint I have is Bixby and the Samsung bloatware.  I bought this unlocked so I wouldn't have the carrier bloatware, but Samsung puts on plenty of their own, and along with Bixby, you can't delete most of it, just disable it.  It continues to nag me to use one of the apps.  I don't know why they want to cram this down the user's throat.  I already bought the phone.  If I thought Samsung had better apps, I'd download them.  But none of their built in apps are better than Google stock apps or other 3rd party. I'm not sure what the reason is for trying to push their apps on users.  I guess to avoid this  you have to buy a Google phone.

"1236","Upgraded from the s6. Love it! Fingerprint on back is cool and hidden home button is good too. Activated verizon set up all online super easy. I bought a caseology case and screen protector. Needed to change the touch screen sensitivity to make it normal (for a while it was difficult to type).
            "
"1237","I have always been a Samsung smartphone loyalist, but that ends now. It's nearly impossible to change the  artery on the S9, therefore, I will need to buy an entirely new phone in the next year or two. But that's not why I'm giving this phone (and Samsung) one star. The microphone stopped working, so no one can hear me when I  call them. From what I have read, this is a major issue which Samsing has failed to address. I tried all fixes to no avail, to include restoring the phone to its factory settings. Very frustrating for an almost $800 phone, which is not a paperweight. Samsing needs to acknowledge and remedy this software glitch.

No contact with verizon at all for set up. Visual vm seemed to be an issue for a lot of reviewers, open the included Samsung vm app and push and hold '1.' Enter password the first time and then you have an app the looks and functions just like the verizon version.For a guy who grew up with the phone wired to the wall, I am still amazed at the technology advancements made. There are a lot of features on this phone, useful stuff to. Just the video and sound improvements alone are awesome as compared to droid t2.First week of use and still learning some features, but very pleased. Battery life is great, almost double my previous phone.I bought a combo with a chrome book, wireless car and home chargers and a case and came out $175 less than v wanted for just the phone and all of their bloatware.

"1239","Ive had galaxy phones since the s3, and this is the first disappointment.  Yes it looks good and battery is good for a new phone, But the issue is it freezes waay to often.  With such available memory and new software this should not be happening now, given its happened to all my other phones once they near the 2 year mark.  This phone is 2 months old though, not happy.

"1240","Moved over from an iPhone 7 .If you can extract yourself from iOS (easier said than done), this is a great phone.Phone itself: excellent call quality. headphones are really nice and there is a headphone jack with no dongle and you don't HAVE to use bluetooth. charges so quickly.Camera: Fantastic in every way.Muzak: Am still a little confused on the various Samsung apps, esp Samsung Music which is so weird. Listening to music/ videos is really nice on this because of the full screen and the front facing speakers.Size: This is a great size ... perfect for me. I am a medium build person with medium sized hands. I did not want a phablet. This phone feels like something between an iPhone 7 and 7+ for comparison. Don't know how it actually compares but feels smaller than the iPhone +.Get a case on this thing. I am using the SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle ... it's thin and grippy.

"1241","You know how excited you get when that package comes with your S9 in it? Well it was 100% a bust. I opened it and the first thing that set me off was no charger or any of the extras. Once I got the phone out of the box, it was immediately  appearant it was a FAKE. Nothing worked. It was a child's play toy. Calling Amazon  was a bit interesting because they had me on hold for about 40 minutes. Buyer beaware you may pay $700 for a fake. I  requested a replacement which should arrive shortly. I will video the opening  and recommend you do you just in case this happens to you. Will update my review on the replacements arrival.

"1242","Samsung Galaxy S9+ Unlocked Smartphone - Lilac Purple - US WarrantyI'll add to this review after a few weeks of use so this is mainly for Sprint users.I inserted this sim which I bought on Amazon because I didn't feel like messing with Sprint employees this time. The sim is Sprint Sim SIMOLW406TQ Samsung Galaxy S9, Samsung Galaxy S9+ search the number, you'll find it. I inserted the sim and followed the activation on the PHONE, not the website. Know your phone number and security pin before you start this and it'll go much smoother for you. It took five minutes and the phone was rocking and I never called Sprint.Other insights. The camera. WOW. They are getting close to SLR quality with these lenses. It's not the same but I'm sure I could fool some with it.Overall speed, excellent.The plus is one Loooong phone. Still fits in my pocket just fineBixby...... WTH is this?That's it for now.

"1243","My husband bought me this phone in the lilac purple color for my birthday,...it's gorgeous! I love the display and the infinity edge. For me this is a total upgrade from the S5 I've been using, I'm so glad I waited! Everything shows up bright and crystal clear. Even my email looks nicer!The emojis you make using the camera do turn out a bit creepy,...they look like you but not really. At my age I don't think this is something I see myself using too often in chat or messenger. It's fun for all of maybe 10 minutes.The camera is nice, the pictures come out clean and clear. However I do wish all the features were explained a bit more in the manual  to make it easier to figure out. It's nice being able to scroll through the different modes with a swipe of your finger but the how-to's on using some of the different options would be nice if they were printed out in the manual for reference. I'm sure it would be easy enough to look on YouTube or Google,....Haha I suppose this is what happens when you go from an old phone and leap frog over a few generations and find yourself in the future. :pI'm not too crazy about Bixby though, there should be a way to reassign the button to something else and remove the app entirely if you choose. I also like my camera settings set so you say ""Smile"", ""Shoot,"" ""Cheese"", ""Record video"", or another trigger word,... but unless you completely turn off the voice for Bixby  you can't use the voice command on the camera. One feature should not cancel out another,... maybe there will be a software update later on.  Or maybe I have completely missed the setting somewhere and will bump into it somewhere after I've used it more?The speakers are excellent, music sounds great and phone calls come through very clear. Using speaker phone I actually had to turn call volume down, on my old phone it was hard to hear people talk and the mic didn't pick up very well either. Not the case here!I love this phone!  It's a nice size, easy to hold, and looks great! It was also very easy to set up and after I played with it for awhile I found it simple to navigate with a few cool surprises thrown in for me to discover. Having read how similar this phone is to the S8 I can understand some people being annoyed at spending all their money and not really getting much more than they already had, but I did read before these were released  that they were similar and if I had an S8 I probably would not have bought this model. For the most part I still feel this is a great phone. I know for a fact I will have a great time taking pictures and videos of my kids and grandkids with it!*3/21/18-  Added a few sample pictures,  one is a  close up (approx.12"" away, begging dog wanted my lunch), another a couple inches away, and the others from about 15 feet. No filters just had the camera set to auto and let it do its thing. Pictures come out clear and so much nicer than from my other phone. I've been playing with the other features as well and results are great too.Using the volume button to snap a quick picture is convenient, it makes taking pictures with this size phone so much easier. I'll have a great time using this camera when the grand kids visit!The lock screen is a little annoying when you have to click the power button then do the swipe screen, but in a way it's useful, my old phone did all sorts of things on its own while tumbling around  in my bag. The hidden home button and the power button are both quick and responsive, either one quickly wakes the phone up but the home button brings up the home screen if you press it when the screen is off. You can always change the time out settings so your screen doesn't click off as fast to give you more time, so not really a big deal for me.This is a fun phone to have. Battery life for me is great, I keep the display on bright because it's just so pretty. I also have the time  out screen set for 5 minutes. I just charge my phone once a day and I'm good to go! No regrets with this phone.

"1244","I paid more than $700 and all I got was an empty box!!!  Not only that, but this seems to have been a reconditioned unit, or some kind of ""new old stock"", re-handled and re-labeled.  But what I really got was a box that was sealed with factory tape (or reconditioner's shop tape), all the accessory cables and connectors, but NO SAMSUNG PHONE!!!  Pay $700, get ZERO!!!!!
            "
"1245","UPDATE: Well, I've had my S9 plus for almost 2 mths now & I see it more every day! It's so fast compared to my other phone! I'm really glad I took the plunge & ordered this phone.I was really nervous about ordering this phone after reading the reviews, but after receiving it, I'm so glad I ordered from Amazon. I didn't order from a third party seller. The phone came packaged in a huge box surrounded by air pockets plastic. Everything was sealed and looked brand new. Still, the first thing I did was contact Samsung to verify that this was a new phone with a valid 1 yr warranty. They assured me that it was indeed new and had a 1 year manufacturers warranty. When I tried signing up for prepaid service, the IMEI number only worked with Verizon. After chatting with the sales reps online, he assured me that wifi calling would work. I was doubtful after reading multiple reviews online, but figured I'd it didn't, I could go with T-Mobile next month. I called Samsung again after signing up with Verizon and the rep at Samsung said my phone was unlocked & would have worked with any carrier. Yesterday, when I got my Verizon Sim card & put it in, no wifi calling. I checked again in a couple minutes & boom! I had all kinds of features that weren't in my phone before including wifi calling and HD calling. So happy with this phone. It's lightening fast, the screen is brilliantly beautiful & the pics it takes are unmatched. Plus, no unnecessary apps that I had on my Galaxy S7 Edge from AT&T. Love this phone.
            "
"1246","Samsung makes the best displays on the market, and I love almost everything about this phone... except the display.  The picture quality is excellent, but these curved edges and rounded display corners have got to go.Regarding the curved edges - they have no functional propose that couldn't be achieved with a flat screen.  No matter how you hold the phone you'll get glare at one edges or the other.  Images and text message the edge get distorted.  On-screen buttons at the edge are problematic at best.  The curved edges make it virtually impossible for a case to properly protect the phone if dropped.The rounded display corners are ridiculous.  In many apps it really makes no difference, but in some there's just content you can't see.  Ironically, the claimed display size of 5.8"" is measured as if the corners were not rounded.The fingerprint sensor placement is poor (though common).  If the phone is face up on a table I must pick it up to unlock it (or position my face directly above the screen for other biometrics).Everything else is great: performance, responsiveness, display quality, battery life - all the things you'd normally expect from a flagship device.  But these other bizarre design choices are baffling.

"1247","I wanted this phone a year ago! Finally got it! But was undecided after receiving it whether or not to keep it because of the newer S10 that was going to be released. I just love this lilac color! It is a well needed upgrade! My old phone had only 16 GB, I had to constantly delete the few apps installed just to get another one. With this S9 worries no more for it is 128 GB! I love the quick smooth response! I was able to update too!  I was also able to use a case I bought for it thats not available for the S10e yet. (They have all the cool cases on ebay.)  I knew of the S10 & plus but not of the S10e, oh well, my bad....After playing with the S9 I just couldn't send it back....I think this S9 is just as great so far. Good sound, picture, etc...Works for my needs thus far!

"1248","We received the international model of this phone after purchasing two from Amazon, supposedly unlocked. I was on the phone 2+ hours between Amazon, Samsung, and Total Wireless (our service provider, uses Verizon network) figuring out why the phone wasn't working properly. The IEMI numbers were not clean. The phones could make calls but the 4g data was not working because they could not be fully registered. The Samsung rep said that the phones are an international version and the Total Wireless rep said they will not work on their network. Now I have to return these phones. What a waste of time. I'm so frustrated!

"1249","I love Samsung phones but not this one. I upgraded from a galaxy 6 to the 9. It has so many issues that I just went back to my 6. Positive: transferring everything from my 6 to the 9 was easy peasy. This phone has an incredible battery life even when I play games on it several times a day. That's about the only thing I really like about the phone. The thing I noticed the very first day was the picture quality was blurry on all my photos that I took. That's the main thing I use the phone for. I tried several settings, but photo quality still remains to be an issue.For the first few weeks, my phone would actually show me notifications as to when I had emails, but then that just stopped. I checked every setting and even turned on the sound for the emails. Nothing. I did the 7 ""fixes"" suggested to fix this including downloading different launchers, and doing a reboot of the phone (several times). Nothing. I need to absolutely need to know when I have emails especially now that I'm taking classes again. Even if it did show a notification, if I opend the email app, it would delete the notfication. This wans't a problem to keep something in notification status on the 6. Fingerprint scanner doesn't work majority of the time. I just look like some idiot stroking my phone. creepy. haha. In addition to about 15 other issues listed about this phone, my app that unlocks my house when I arrive stopped working. Tried everything to fix that. nothing. I thought it was the app. But the minute I switched back to my 6, the app started working again. So, now I believe it's because of the 9. This has been the worse phone I have ever had. I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone!

"1250","My last phone Samsung Galaxy note 2 lasted more than 4 years and it is still working but some apps wont work on it so I had to upgrade to a new one.  New S9 is beautiful. Miss my pen but new pen one is ridiculously huge so I went for S9 without pen. Beautiful, smaller size, weight phone. I had extra money to spend, so I bought this one unlocked. Unlocked is the way to go, so when I am out of country(USA) I can buy another chip and put it on it. Plus there are no carrier specific spams on it. It is faster since my Note 2 was ageing and slowed down. Else there is not much they can put on it. Camera results are amazing. Music, I find no difference. I hope this is the last of the Smartphone, since they cannot find more to put on a smartphone that will hook falks on it.
            "
"1251","Before receiving my phone I received an email from reliant cellular (the seller) giving me instructions on how to resolve an issues should any arise. This made me feel good about the purchase because I got the info to quickly get help in the case I need any.The phone I ordered was as described, new, and perfect. I easily took the sim card out of my old phone (I used a pay as you go phone plan through simple mobile) inserted it and started using it. I will be switching plans because my carrier just doesn't cover enough areas that I tend to travel, but when I do switch, again I will be able to just swap out the sim and continue where I left off. I was initially concerned during start up that it wasn't unlocked due to a ton of mentions and programs for Verizon, but it is unlocked.My battery lasts me all day, unless my kids are watching endless videos. The screen and picture/ video quality is amazing! I'm so happy with this phone!! I'm still finding different things to play around with and personalizing my phone and I've had it for a week.

"1252","The phone does every great, EXCEPT the actual phone part is horrible.  I¡¯m probably going to return it.  Calls drop every day.  It won¡¯t dial out unless I restart it.  This happens whether the call is WiFi or via the carrier.  This did not happen with my last 6 phones.  Same carrier for last 6 phones, but this ""Flagship"" is a POS WITH A CAPITAL ""S"".  In addition, it does not hold its value.  It¡¯s unbelievable to me that a OnePlus will sell on EBay for 95% of its purchase price every 6 months when the new version arrives.  But I bought this on Cyber Monday for $547 plus tax with a normal price of $899 and it¡¯s selling on EBay in the 400s!  that¡¯s ridiculous drop in value compared to OnePlus.  My biggest complaint is failure to dial out.  I¡¯ve tried rebooting.  I¡¯ve tried resetting everything.  I¡¯ve called my carrier.  While the camera is exceptional, it FAILS at being a phone!!!!!!  UPDATE JAN 24, 2019 - I received a replacement.  The replacement had the same defects as the original, PLUS The volume from speakers was lower.  It is unworthy to be called a flagship.  It looks nice.  It has a nice screen.  It has a terrific camera.  It is a LOUSY phone - it¡¯s main function.  It is Filled with Samsung Bloatware.  AND the predictive swipe texting on both phones was the worst at predicting words of any phone I¡¯ve ever owned.  The keyboard sucks in swipe mode.  Horrible.  I¡¯m going to OnePlus (no bloatware) or Apple (security and just great products).

"1253","Before I start I need to say that I came from a Windows 10 phone and a flawless working mobile platform. However, after a long time using Windows phone it's clear that a Android phone is quite a shock, because everything is on your shoulders to get it customized/optimized. Regardless of this, my biggest contra is on battery life. This is unbelievable, max 12-14hr if you use WIFI, this is not top. My last Alcatel Idol 4s Windows phone last forever comparing to Samsung Galaxy S9+. The good thing is, you can customize and make it more ""Microsoft like"", Microsoft applications including Office, OneDrive, Cortana and Outlook do not come preinstalled, but when you can personalize the device with Microsoft's productivity applications so every customer is able to work, play and connect on their device when they leave. The design is nice, the camera pretty awesome, took some test photo's and they look great. To install everything and import stuff such as text and/or MMS messages take time (and additional tools). Without customization the default installation made the phone super ""wordi"", just sending from every app messages etc. So, I recommend to check this first to fulfill your needs. The screen is stunning, clear picture. And it's good to see, Samsung is catching up with former Microsoft Hello technology to have fingerprint, iris, face recognition. Thats a very good feature which is also used in additional apps such as banking. I'm also concerned about IP68 (water protection) because there is no rubber seal protecting the sim and micro sd card from water. Bottom line: battery life is for me the absolute negative point, therefore 3 stars

"1254","IT CAN BARELY MAKE A PHONE CALL.80% of the time I try calling someone, it's either mute on both ends or the call drops instantly. I have already tried the following to remedy the situation:* checked my cellular signal strength (I was outside and my carrier is excellent)* repositioned SIM card* restarted phone* reset network settings* disabled/enabled wifi calling* disabled/enabled data roaming/metering settings* cleared cache* factory reset phoneAny of these options at best got my calling working just fine for several minutes before it starts failing again. Sometimes it works just fine out of nowhere; it's simply random. After several contacts with Samsung's customer support representatives they referred me to my choice of a UBreakiFix location. Out of the 4 local areas only one dealt with in-warranty repairs, and that dealer then told me something along the lines of my phone being an ""overseas model"" and therefore did not have the capacity, at his store, to repair my phone. Finally, I speak with Resty (BIG thank you to Resty for being very helpful and understanding) who then assures me my phone will be repaired at their center located in Texas, offering me free overnight shipping so that my phone returns to me as quickly as possible.""Why didn't you just return it?"" Because I did not have these issues within the first few hours of activating the phone and had already bought a screen protector + case for it so I can protect my $500+ phone. I only noticed the issue some days later.""So what? Just get a new one."" What good would that do? If there's any takeaway from this it's that even a new device with an issue that's well known for over a year can still lack reasonable support solutions.It's even more absurd for Samsung to have this listing on Amazon for a new phone with such a common problem and NO way to repair it locally (unless you live in Texas!) I'd highly suggest Samsung/Amazon take this listing down until a full inventory review is conducted to avoid needlessly pissing off a large percentage of customers for much more money. If these ""overseas"" models were not meant to be sold in the U.S., DON'T SELL THEM HERE, or at the very least post a disclaimer at the top of the listing!

"1255","I was SO excited to get my new phone... I opened the Amazon box(in tact) to find a Samsung Galaxy S9 box. The outer sleeve of the box was dented and ripped. First I was disappointed because I did not order a used phone, I ordered a new phone and expected a new looking box. I then took the sleeve off and finished opening the box only to find that there was NO PHONE in the box at all, no phone, no charger, no nothing!!!!! I am so disappointed and furious I could scream. I spent a lot of money on the phone. I called Amazon and the woman told me there was nothing they could do. She told me that they needed to start a 3 day investigation. No reassurance, nothing. They told me to call them back in 3 days. I am guessing they have some internal theft going on?? Not sure what else it would be. I order from Amazon all the time. I rarely have an issue, but this makes me rethink ordering from Amazon, or online at all. Has anyone else had something like this happen???

"1256","****UPDATE 1/14/19****My original review for the phone is below. I have owned this for 1 month and found my phone would not update to the latest firmware, it kept saying it was up to date from July 2018 even though Samsungs website showed monthly updates. I contacted Samsung, provided the IMEI number for the phone and found it was factory locked to a specific carrier (not mine and NOT the one seller said it was unlocked for.) I contacted that carrier and found it was unpaid by the owner and would be locked until that person paid it off, the IMEI was held against the original owners social security number due to the unpaid balance and they told me to return the phone, the seller was committing a form of fraud by selling me that phone. I would ALWAYS suggest contacting Samsung with the IMEI number to verify it IS fully unlocked before putting all of your info into the new phone.***Original review****There are only 2-3 downfalls I have found with this phone and one related to the seller, I bought a refurbished phone and it still had the old phone number registered to it which is a fault on the seller, but also a caution to anyone buying refurbished.The other ""downfalls"" are related to the curved edge screen. It is impossible to find a case that protects the screen on all sides due to this. I have found multiple cases that are raised on the top and bottom keeping the screen off tabletops when face down however the sides are still exposed. The other is I can see a slight flicker on the sides if I turn the phone slightly, this may or may not be with every phone or just mine since it was refurbished.Now onto the good!The speaker quality feels like the phone is it's own handheld movie theater. The color is extraordinary. Battery life has been better than my previous s7 but not as good as I was expecting for a model 2 years newer and the plus version. Response time is impeccable. There is bass with the sound. No lagging whatsoever. Highly recommend the phone just note the curved edges are exposed and that part makes me nervous.
            "
"1257","This is so much better than my Note 4, not that I didn't like the 4. The one thing I didn't notice until actually getting the S9+ is that the security control by Knox is within the S9+. I think I read this is a preferred requirement by businesses now for their enterprise cell phones for employees. Could be a very good thing for all of us. It does require me to play with it more to find out how I need to ""tailor"" it to settings I prefer so it is easier for me personally. But hey, I love discovering new things anyway. The screen is beautiful for my Midnight Black version of my S9+, the responsiveness is fantastic and memory space is oh so much better. And buying it unlocked? I find that to be the one thing I didn't expect to be outstanding. I hope and plan this to last me a long long time.
            "
"1258","I have a Galaxy S7 that I love.  Despite being big, it feels nice in my hand and is easy to use.  The S9 with its curved edges was infuriating to use.  My palm kept hitting the side of the screen when I reached across the phone.And I really don't get the point of the curved edge.  It doesn't do anything useful I care about, it just makes it hard to use.  I think Samsung decided they had to do something interesting and different to give it a ""wow"" factor, despite it being worse than useless.So my brother says you can get a big case to cover up the edges to solve the problem.  Ok, but if the solution is to just cover the edges up, what's the point of having it in the first place???And it's super tall.  Which I also don't understand.  It makes it hard for my thumb to reach the top of the phone.I feel like Samsung has fallen into the trap where their shareholders just want the stock to keep going up, so it's not enough to sell a million phones, they have to sell 2 million next quarter, so instead of making a good useful phone they are going to make a gimmicky phone to try to attract people with new gimmicks even if they're not useful.I returned the S9 after a day of use and I'm back to my S7.  I'll probably get a Pixel 3 instead eventually.

"1259","First off, the a##hold carrier that delivered it left it on the front porch in the freaking snow and ice- so I was not happy about that at all.  I am frankly sick to death of the delivery people Amazon uses, and their delivery promises that aren't kept.  Delivery was promised Sunday but I didn't get it until today.  I watched up until 8:00 last night when I got an email stating that it would be delivered TODAY by 8 p.m. instead of yesterday by 8 p.m.The phone appears to be new, but I have no idea how to tell.  It looks new, is spotless and my daughter loves it (so far).  I will update my evaluation as time goes on.
            "
"1260","Had to get a new phone, and really dislike the other options. The major drawbacks for this phone are the edge display, which is impossible to find a good screen protector for, and the fact that after recently cracking the display, I realized it costs roughly half the price of the phone to replace.  Other than the price of the display and the obnoxious, and seemingly pointless beveled ""edge"", I absolutely love the camera, and the phone is very fast.  The Sprint network obviously does the phone zero justice, so you may want to change service providers to benefit the the performance that this phone has to offer.
            "
"1261","Had no trouble transferring apps from my old S4, though I did have to re-enter some passwords.  The cable connection didn't seem to work, but then it found the old phone on wifi and grabbed everything anyway.  The screen is completely eye-popping, especially after setting it to the highest resolution.  Blazingly fast compared to the S4 and the battery seems to last and last.  One real annoyance (but still giving it 5 stars): it's really hard to turn off the Bixby ""feature"" and it's tied to a dedicated button right under the volume control.  The button can't be used for anything else and is really easy to hit by accident.  C'mon Samsung.  The people that don't want it, don't want it.  It should be a simple setting to turn it off and assign the button to something else or nothing.  Magnificent device overall though.
            "
"1262","I liked my Samsung GS7 Edge, but I *love* this phone!  The Oreo Android 8 update on the GS7e is pretty poky, but this phone screams!  Two apps I like but could barely use on the Samsung were the Microsoft ""Arrow"" launcher and the Google ""CarPlay Autos"" apps - Painfully slow on GS7e, but on GS9+ they scream!  Battery life continues to be excellent, better screen, better USB jack, better stereo sound, and also much better BlueTooth (I had some devices that were really slow to properly connect on GS7e's BT4.0, but GS9+'s BT5.0 rocks so far).  I wish Samsung and Google were a little less heavy-handed on insistently pushing their more privacy-invasive features (like location history, etc), and I wish I could uninstall a few GB of Samsung cr@pware though...

"1263","I upgraded to this Samsung S9 Model SM-G960U1 unlocked version from a Samsung S7.  The phone works just fine and the transfer of all my stuff from the old phone to the new went pretty well.  While the curved screen has a visual appeal I believe that a flat screen would be both more practical and easier to protect.  In terms of it being a tool, I haven't discovered anything new that this phone can do that the S7 couldn't do.  It comes with something called ""Bixby"" that I guess we're supposed to all just know what it is and what to do with it... guess I'm not interested in Bixby until I see some information that educates me on what it does and why I might need it... I do like Samsung phones and once you've grown accustomed to a company's android interface it makes sense to stay with what is familiar.  If you have an S7 or S8 there is probably no reason to upgrade to the S9 version unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket.  In my case, one of my son's needed a phone so he got my old S7 and I treated myself to a new phone.
            "
"1264","Note that this review is of how the product arrived and first day thoughts, it's not in-depth of the phone long-term.Contrary to what a few other customers seemed to have experienced in some reviews, my phone came completely brand new and not tampered with at all. Everything worked fine from launch and all I had to do was transfer my SIM and SD cards over (I use Verizon, the SIM works just fine, no need to contact them.) There's nothing I can see regarding damage or issues with the phone related to how it was sent or what could have happened beforehand.I bought this phone unlocked and new in order to avoid the Verizon bloatware I never used but couldn't manage to get rid of. It was also nice to avoid the hidden fees attached to new phones bought through providers.My initial thoughts are: it's fantastic.The picture quality is stunning, especially coming from a Droid Turbo II (which was a nice phone for what it was, but the screen is so lackluster in comparison.) The camera is beautiful and I could easily say justifies the pricepoint for those looking at the market for photography in comparison to other phones I've seen and I haven't even touched many of the features.The speakers are surprisingly clear and sound great. I've noticed a trend with many smartphones from day one to just have... awful speakers for some reason. Maybe manufacturers assume you're using peripherals and Bluetooth at all times. Regardless, this phone covers that base better than most others.The slim and tall design feels much better in my hand than I was expecting it to, coming from a smaller phone.I love the shortcuts on this Android version and just how the entire Galaxy line operates in general. Samsung has always made stellar leaps in convenience mixed with modernization and the S9+ is no different.As far as Bixby goes: I don't use voice commands on phones, whether it be Bixby, Google Assistant, etc., period. I just avoid the Bixby button (my one caveat with this phone is part of the hardware being designed exclusively for Bixby) so it doesn't apply.I will update this later regarding other things like battery life, communication features, and anything else I can think of after using it for an extended period of time.

"1265","I bought this phone brand new from amazon... it was very clearly used.  The phone had been set to spanish (us) and already had a folder labeled ""Applicacions de Microsoft"" on it and the message app spelling dictionary only had the option for spanish (us).  Cant trust anyone these days.  On the bright side they included a phone case for free lol! Thanks who ever sent me this phone I appreciate that.It is a SM-G9650 (Snapdragon 845) cpu but because of that its region is set for china ... not the USA.  So mine didn't come with the ability to do some stuff (wifi calling for example) that you would expect from a new phone.The phone itself is awesome.  I have large hands and its just a little too big to use with one hand for me which is its only drawback.  Most normal people would use it with 2 hands but I have to be different.The picture quality is great even when capturing action shots (tried to sneak a pic of my girlfriend but she moved and I made an ugly face for half a second... the picture is so clear its like we planned for her to do that face for the picture).It works with the Samsung Qi Certified Fast Charge Wireless Charging Convertible Stand/Pad and does fast charge on it.Coming from an iPhone 4 this thing is night and day difference but I bet you could say that about any new phone.When I  open apps they open immediately.  Browsing the web and watching youtube videos is smooth and uninterrupted... On my old iPhone the youtube app would lock up after an hour or so of use.  Plus I can download apps again LOL!  My old phone was so old it wouldnt get ios updates and its level of ios isnt supported by ANYTHING so I couldnt even get my email with it anymore!I did discover one thing that I don't like about it over the iPhone.... You cant turn off apps from being able to use mobile data in the foreground (you can turn off background usage).  So if you are on data and you open up youtube or 9gag and start using it its using your data.  On an iPhone if you go into your cellular data section of your settings and turn an app off it will not be allowed to ever use any mobile data unless you go back in and turn that back on.  REALLY saves you from using data when you have a wifi connection available but not connected for whatever reason and you start browsing the web.

"1266","I switched from the LG v30 to this model because I wanted something smaller. It is More comfortable, lighter.Picture quality is way better from both cameras hands down. The phone picks fingerprints Easily but not bad. Screen is brighter and it gets dimmer.Samsung pay is a plus.  Android pie update available.  Looks like Samsung is faster than lg when it comes to updates.Phone lags a but when closing applications  on the new android pie with the new one ui. The fingerprint sensor is really fast and the sound is better when using the phone speakers more immersive since the v30 only has a bottom speakerBattery I haven't test long enough.

"1267","If you don't mind losing features from your carrier get an unlocked phone. This phone is not programmed with any carriers software. I have lost 5 or 6 options I need with ATT. ATT tells me there is nothing I can do and they cannot flash or install their software. My only option is to buy a new phone, unlocked directly from ATT. This phone is a waste of money and had I known all this prior to buying it, I would not have bought it.

"1268","Just upgraded due to a stellar cyber Monday sale. The phone was just $519 with a free Amazon show included. What an upgrade from the S5. I love my old phone. It still works just like it did from day one. BUT  This.....Samsung S9 is by far a better phone than any iPhone out there. The screen is bigger crystal clear display. Lots of cool new features in emojis and apps that my s5 didn't have access to. Battery life is phenomenal! The sound is better then any phone I have used. The curved edges give the screen the largest view. The camera seems very good. Still learning some of the new features.  I have no idea about some of these reviews, Mine came in a sealed box brand, I called Samsung they thanked me for being a loyal customer and said it comes with a two year warranty. I did buy a case and a screen protector. Thank you amazon for the great deal! (Will work with T Mobile, Boost, Red Pocket and ATT. ) As a precaution call your provider before you order :)  Heads up This will not work with SPRINT they do not accept any unlocked androids. Kind of a hassle, so I switched providers.

"1269","I received the phone and when i opened I realised the package has been previously opened and resealed.  Everything was in the box but no device to open sim card holder and no paperwork  It says US warranty but that is a lie there is absolutely no paperwork.  I have activated the phone and it appears to be working I will write a next review one month in to let you know how it goes.

"1270","I bought the Samsung Galaxy S9 Like New from Amazon Warehouse Deals and NOT an authorized seller. I wanted an extra $50 off cause someone touched the phone but then returned it. I work in education; I'll take any deal I can get. I also made sure the phone came with original packaging (It was stated in the condition description).So far, I am very pleased with this purchase. The phone is lovely. It came with the plastic still on and all the original pieces such as headphones and the little tools for popping out the sim card. It does not come with a charger so I picked some up in a separate order.I have AT&T. Getting my service sorted was a bit tricky but it is set up and everything is working now. I went to one store and the agent switched the sim card and checked calling service but not my data. I left, I shopped, and then suddenly realized that my internet wasn't working. Went to another store but the agents were useless and only wanted to sell me stuff that was irrelevant to my issue. So it goes. I went home and called AT&T. Three agents and an hour later I rolled a yahtzee and Mark the Advanced Tech guru came on the phone. We did a bunch of stuff on the phone having to do with my IMEI and APN. Neither immediately worked. Finally, he had me hang up and turn my phone off so he could ""zap it."" He called me back after, cause that's the kind of class act Mark is. Huzzah! My mobile data was working without issue.One disadvantage of buying the phone Like New is that the warranty was started by the person who first bought it. It does not say anywhere in the Amazon description when the phone was first purchased. I registered the phone with my Samsung account and it shows that the warranty started in June. I am therefore assuming that's when the first owner registered it. It is beginning of Dec. now. If I anticipated really using the warranty (I don't) I might find this annoying.I'll also point out that I bought this phone with my Discover during an Amazon cashback quarter. The 5% cashback covered my state tax. This saved me an extra $30 that I put toward a microsd card for more storage.If anything goes wrong with this phone, I will update in the future. So far, I am tickled lilac with my Like New Amazon Warehouse Deals phone.

"1271","Too expensive to have such a short life. This S9 was my 2nd expensive phone purchased in Amazon. First I bought S7 refurbished. Horrible idea! Had a short life of maybe 7 months. Second time I purchased this S9 less than a year ago, priced around $800.00USD - Phone was good, but it started to get slow to reinitiate plus last time it was updating over night, it simply never came back to life. Too expensive for such a short life. Will not buy any more cell phones in Amazon. I went straight back to Best Buys to get some insurance, warranty and anything possible.
            "
"1272","It was waiting for me when I got home, and it's perfect. Everything is in the box as it should be, all wrapped in cling plastic and brand new. I've only had the phone for a few hours now so I can't make any claims about how well it works, but it's definitely new. Some of the reviews had made me nervous but it isn't scratched, used, or missing all together. It even has the SmartSwitch paperwork, user guide, health warnings, and extra ear bud caps (still sealed). My only complaint isn't with the phone, but with the delivery person. They left it in my back yard for some reason, so my dog chewed into the cardboard Amazon box and put some deep gouges in the external S9 sleeve. But nothing important was damaged.
            "
"1273","What a great phone. Sansung has done a great job of updating thetr android os and this thing is beautiful. Fast, great screen, and has sd card capability. This was part of a promotion carried by Samsung and alsk by Amazon. It included a free Samsung ""chromebook"" which has turned out to be my goto tablet/laptop. Crazy, huh? Very happy with phone connection, messaging and every thing else.
            "
"1274","I was highly disappointed when I received a locked device rather than ""unlocked"" as advertised. I was however very pleased with the speed in which I received my replacement, which was the very next day. I contacted amazon and the replacement was sent without even having to return locked device first, something that surprised me.There was no damage to the box or any missing pieces, the device came brand new as expected (even the locked device was in excellent condition). It's been roughly 2-3 weeks since I've been utilizing my device, and I'm very pleased with my purchase. I have had no issues so far *knock on wood*, and it was an easy switch moving from the Samsung S6 to the S9.So despite the initial hiccup with the phone being locked, the speed in which it was rectified definitely made up for the initial mix up. So overall I'm happy with my purchase.
            "
"1275","This is a great phone and I would buy it again outside of all the tracking that Google and Samsung do on you that can't be removed no matter how much messing with it you do.My only complaint is that Verizon says that it is not a authorize phone even though if you just swap your old sim card into it the device works fine.  It just won't show up on your account as a recognized phone with model number that you can manage but atleast you avoid the activation fee.
            "
"1276","I took this phone to a Verizon store to set it up and transfer my current Verizon phone number to the new phone. They checked the serial number and informed me that this phone is not compatible with their network.
            "
"1277","Buyer beware. Unlocked phones do not support some carrier features like video calling and wifi calling. I bought this s9 plus to use on Verizon wireless and these features are blocked. The reason they are blocked is because it's an unlocked phone and Verizon wants you to spend the big bucks buying the phone from them to use all the features the phone supports. It BS really but that's just how it is. So if you buy this or any unlocked phone then you can expect some of the features not to work. I warned you.
            "
"1278","Received the product on time, however there were no accessories, on further inspection the phone was fake. All accessories were in Chinese, it felt like only a weight was inside the device . The back of the device only had stickers for the camera, led and fingerprint reader. Just casually looking on the device you won't be able to tell, but once you actually touch it you can feel it. Going through the reviews it seems this happens a lot with the Lilac version.Amazon Customer service was extremely understanding and helpful and quickly processed my oder and I was able to get the black version which I am happy with now.

"1279","FirstI want to say that I am typing this review on my Samsung Galaxy S9 on Verizon with full 4g LTE. I wanted to point that out to end the confusion.I got the phone, put the sim card from my old phone into this one and after about 10 minutes of updates and verizon settings it was ready to go.I did not need to do anything special and it works beautifully.Excellent phone for an absolute great price. I highly recommend this phone. Add it to your save for later and watch the price. I managed to snag this phone brand new factory unlocked for just over $500. I am sure it can be had for about that price (if not less once the S10 comes out).Enjoy the phone!

"1280","Update April 9: I¡¯ve ordered the Samsung Galaxy S9 phone twice (two separate occasions) and when I tried to register them at Samsung, I found out that the phones were intended for the Hong Kong market and that Samsung US would not warranty the phones.  Warranty would only be honored if the phone was sent to Hong Kong. Additionally, these phones have specific Hong Kong parts so getting a repair in the US may be difficult because parts may not be available. I¡¯ve returned both to amazon with no issues.  In talking with amazon customer service, I was told they were going to pull the inventory and figure out where things went wrong. Btw, the only was to find out if the phone is a US marketed phone is to call Samsung. You cannot tell by model number and only Samsung can tell by the IMEI number.

"1281","The phone arrived in an open box so I assumed it had been used before. I noticed off the bat that the Bixby button was stuck so I tried manipulating it with a small tool but it wouldn't work. After initial setup, I figured I would try the phone for a few says and it seemed ok. But, I noticed it was NOT holding a charge. I reread the description of the phone and realized it was refurbished. So I packed it back up and sent it back. Waiting for refund now.

"1282","~3 months of use, overall amazing phone. Got it on a Black Friday sale for ~$640 when it was around $800. The 64GB is great and is easily made 128GB with the purchase of an $11 Samsung MicroSD card so you don't have to spend the extra money for the 128GB model.The phone is fast and smooth. It handled games well.Samsung really thought things through and made the interface very user friendly. The bixby button isn't a big deal but Bixby can do many things that other assistants cannot (such as lock your phone or swipe notification bar down, etc.).As of late 2018-early 2019 it's one of the best in the market so there's not much more to say.

"1284","Received my new phone last week. Lots of options & lots to learn. My phone, according to my carrier, is a dual sim. I did put an SD card in the other slot.  My model number is SM-G9650. The phone was unlocked and new in box, as described. Took a bit for the carrier personnel  to determine which sim card to use and they were a great help in activating the phone. Transfer of information from old phone to new one was very easy using smart switch. The first thing I had to do was switch language from Spanish to English. Apparently, since this is an unlocked phone, I am unable to set up voice mail. I learned this from you tube, but will double-check with carrier. Not sure yet about Bixby.11/1/2018:  I visited my carrier and personnel was able to install my voice mail. Had to set it up ""the old way."" Anyway, it's now working and I'm liking my phone so much better!

"1285","I got this phone during a Cyber Monday Sale. Considering the reduced cost and the extra Amazon device included with the package this was a fantastic deal! Buying from Amazon also gave me a peace of mind. Should something go wrong then I have a path of recourse.The phone was new, factory sealed, and unlocked. It fired up right away. Getting it work with Mint Mobile was a little challenging but that's not the phone's fault. The camera is excellent, especially if you shoot in RAW/DNG format and process the image with something like Capture One or Lightroom. Battery life is also great but I also don't use the phone 24/7 non-stop.

No original box or manual or anything else aside from the phone and original charger as described by seller. Popped in my SIM after cutting it down to size.  All my contacts were there.

"1290","+ Camera rocks,+ I like being able to add memory cards.+ love how ell it works support TV's+ bluetooth is fairly stable+/- battery life, the manage function works, but overall i feel like it is degrading quicker than I'd like.- the auto volume annoys the crap out of me.- Bixby, this is Apple like arrogance having a dedicated button you cannot remap- screen has delicate edges, look great but you MUST use protective film, causes a loss of sensitivity.- hate kies and all samsung software for file transfer, just garbage.Overall - I'd take this over the 5G  for now, it is value for money.Improvements I'd like - something that has large music player control buttons for sport/driving.

Waiting for the new User interface and new Android. They should be available very soon. I did a lot of research on this phone before buying. I'm not disappointed. I like Bixby which I didn't think I would use but it's handy. Push the Bixby button and ask for help or open apps, messaging, phone, voice mail. Whatever you want to use and it opens. Call phone number, call voicemail, create and send this message. Very quick and helpful.

"1292","I have only bought Samsung phones before and this one disappointed me. First off, for some reason the screen scratches very easily. My keys were able to put some significant grooves in the screen. The battery life is worse than last year's S8 and I basically have to keep it on battery saving mode all the time. I have had the phone for almost three months now and it seems to be slowing down. It also glitches alot and some apps refuse to open. Overall, for a Samsung, not very impressed.

I have not had time to thoroughly explore it, but it appears to be working just fine.My phone was sitting on the table this morning and it just went dead. I called Samsung Support and they emailed me a next day air shipping label. They were very good about it and I have no complaints.I do not look forward to being without my phone for a week. There are no service centers in my state - Delaware. I still love this phone.

I did have to take it in to a store to get a new Micro SIM card as the one in my previous phone was the larger type and did not fit in the slot. The battery life is great and the cell signal comes in with no issues.

"1295","A phone with a beautiful glass body with many great qualities. Such as the use of Dolby atmos for an exquisite audio experience and custom audio settings. The infinity amoled display looks immensely beautiful with vivid colors and deep black. Another plus that samsung continued the use of the headphones slot. Battery life is great for everyday normal use, and 5he battery saver settings provide options that greatly extend the battery life of the device. Samsung pay is a very nice feature especially since it can work in more places than other digital payment methods.

"1296","Bought from Amazon, not a 3rd party seller, which I would recommend. Came with everything that was advertised (charging cable + adaptive fast charging box, earbuds + extra bud pieces, USB connector for transfers, SIM tray ejector pin, and of course the Samsung 9 plus phone). Unfortunately, I couldn't use the S9+'s camera to take a picture of itself... so the image quality is from the S5. The camera quality of the S9+ is much sharper if you are seeking to upgrade from one of the older phones, the quality does drop a bit in the slow-mo settings but this is understandable for the feature. Since I have only been using the phone for a few days, I will refrain from commenting too much on the quality of the phone itself, but so far it is what I expected it to be and is performing as such. No hiccups thus far and worked fine while transferring my SIM over from my old phone (T-Mobile for anyone who is curious). The phone also has a lot of features that aren't super apparent, so I suggest you read a bit if you purchase it or do some research to fully utilize the phone.Disclaimer on the photo: the phone does not come with the case, glass screen protector, or the charms. Just didn't feel like taking them off to take a photo.

When I reset or turn on the phone, sometimes it will say ""invalid sim"" or ""no sim found"" even though the sim card is inside. Resetting the phone once or twice usually resolves this issue but its annoying. Would have given 5 stars if this issue didn't exist

"1302","So far I am happy with the phone, as I am still in the learning process, It works with Verizon Prepaid service.I do not like the fact that I cannot use my stylus to save the use of my arthritic fingers. Samsung needs to create a tool that can be used to dial and text without using fingers, as my Orthopedic Doctor said too many patients are coming in with bone problems in the thumbs especially from texting. When you use the voice instead of fingers,the words at times come out mispelled and may be harder to understand.

It's also neat that it's anti tangle. I got this phone because I was tired of my cheap Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime from Metropcs. It lagged a lot, horrible camera, and overall poor performance. Now I can play games and multi-task with no lag. The camera is excellent and will be using it to take model pictures of my girlfriend. The stereo speakers is loud and amazing, perfect for videos. I 100% recommend buying this product.

"1306","Phone was much less expensive than if bought through Verizon, and unlocked so no bloatware. Comfortable to hold, nice clear display, easy to set up. Take SIM out of old phone, put SIM in new phone...done. Attached old phone to new to transfer data. Some bloatware also transferred, but, as this is an unlocked phone, it was easy to uninstall (could not be done on old phone). A couple of people said the sound on their end was not as good as on old phone, a Motorola Droid Maxx. (One reporting it kept breaking up. Could be on their end). Bit of a learning curve, and some time needed to set up icons, especially on the side bar, but that was expected. Well worth it!Samsung Galaxy S9 Unlocked Smartphone - Midnight Black - US Warranty

All my apps transferred without problem and now they all work without freezing up or buffering.

I've only had the phone about 2 months so the battery life is good.I learned that the charging ports in my car really charge this phone slowly and bought a cigarette lighter type charging port that uses the right amps to get a quick charge on my phone.It's worth it to buy the correct Amp charging plugs of you have several cables around the house and car as I do.
            "
"1317","Its a solid phone with some obnoxious 'features'. They added a hard button just to force you to use their crappy new voice assistant Bixby.  That along with the fact you can't get root access to the phone, makes this a big disappointment.  One of the best selling points is the finger print reader on the back which works well and the removable storage which is a must, but since I can't simply uninstall bixby I don't think ill be getting a Samsung ever again.
            "
"1318","Love the Samsung software and I'm so glad that I purchased the 9+ for best battery, rather than the 9.  My phone performs perfectly, much better than the S5 it replaced.  Performance on my loaded phone is incredibly fast and responsive.  It was a huge dollar investment, but I have zero reqrets or reservations.  Beautiful phone. More than 5 stars!
            "
"1319","I bought my phone as soon as the end of my return date came my phone started to malfunction I have had no tech support or no one who was able to help me with my issue
            "
"1320","It is an AT&T model with all their ""free software"" installed.  New condition, delivered in a timely manner.  Very good value and great Amazon service you can depend on.  Very pleased.The device is standard Samsung, solid build quality and dependability.  Excellent (for the money) AKG ear buds which I find to provide far superior audio quality and comfort to the ones Apple gave me with the XR.  Excellent screen and very good battery life compared to my S7.
            "
"1321","My biggest fear of buying this unlocked phone was that it would not be compatible with our phone service - we use Total Wireless which is on Verizon's CDMA system.  It worked perfectly - went through the set-up process in approximately 15 minutes.  Just got them for Christmas.  Will update review after using for awhile to rate battery life and other features.
            "
"1322","Speaker phone failed.  Normal audio VERY weak volume. Most thought it was another app causing the problem.  Ran ALL the step by step tests removing apps one by one and restarting with experts. No luck. Many complaints in s9+ user community all around the US, UK and Australia.  No recall or solution offered.  We even did a factory reset and it still did not work. Too many complaints.  No solution.  Turned in for refund.
            "
"1323","An unlocked phone does not connect to the ATT network like one bought from ATT.  Husband bought same phone through ATT and can actually make and receive calls with 4 bars when I have no bars and can't call out. This is basically a wifi device for apps and internet.
            "
"1324","Fast shipping. Super easy to set up on my existing Verizon account. The lilac purple is very pretty. This phone is awesome! I upgraded from the Galaxy S6 Edge + and it is a huge improvement. It is the first time I bought an unlocked phone and I think I will continue to do so as all the extra Verizon apps aren't present and in my way. Love it!
            "
"1325","Great brand new Android phone ""sold by and shipped from Amazon.com"" at a decent Good Friday sale price.  Delivered in 10 days with free standard shipping.  I brought it to the local T-Mobile store (USA) for initial free setup (purchased new sim card) and it works perfectly on their network.  I've had it for about 5 weeks now without issue.  Battery charge lasts 3-4 days under light usage, taking care to close background apps, regularly optimize battery (under Device Maintenance) and power off the phone at night.
            "
"1326","I was a little nervous to order this phone through Amazon after reading some reviews, but I have had absolutely no issues. I am very happy with my purchase. It was easy to set up and transfer all my information to this phone. I was also able to easily register my phone to ensure I get the full manufacture warranty.
            "
"1327","This is a great phone. I just upgraded from an HTC phone & the Galaxy S9 plus makes it look like a toy. I'm in a not so great service area & so far so good. I also had problems with Wi-Fi in my house with the other phone & so far have had no issues with that.
            "
"1328","This is my personal phone replacing my galaxie s6.  It works so much smoother than the s6 although it was a good phone.  I just wanted to upgrade and glad I did  .I have only had it about a month but so far so good.  Some things I am still learning on it but pretty much the same.  Picture quality is great.  I have verison no contract and just changed out the sim and was ready to go.  I had to download an app to transfer my pictures.  I had a glass cover put on to protect the screen and they had to put six on before they could get one to stick.  It should be good to go now.
            "
"1329","This is a fantastic phone I've had iphone for many many years now I have this one and I love it I thought I'd never give up my iPhone but now you can have it I love this phone face recognition finger recognition or finger print pay pass multiple uses easy use strong battery life love this phone
            "
"1330","The S9 in locked. Is not working with any global gsm
            "
"1331","Been using for month, saved $100 plus dollars than directly from T-Mobile.  Was new in box with all hardware.  Correct model 960u supports bands 66/71.  Disappointed in sound quality unless I'm doing something wrong.  Ring tones are low volume and call volume is not as loud as previous phone.  Have volume at max?  Otherwise loaded with features.
            "
"1332","Love the size of the phone, and being able to set the size of the font. Do recommend a case as with the edge to edge I found that I kept hitting edge controls when I did not intend to.
            "
"1333","I upgraded from a s7 and I really like this phone. The face unlock is probably the best thing, buy the fingerprint reader seems faster and easier than the s7. So far I haven't found anything I don't like
            "
"1334","This is completely absurd was sent an international version which does not work with my carrier unlike it was described. absolutely ridiculous.
            "
"1335","Great shape. Easy to activate. Being used on straight talk via Verizon towers. I simply put my SIM card in it from my old phone. Came with everything I need,  but need to buy new car charger since the connection is different than my old android. The charger it comes with is so fast. And phone books charge so much longer than my old phone
            "
"1336","My husband bought me this and tonight, I received this box. When I opened it, I found this instead...a lint remover! Luckily Amazon said they can help me but omg I am so pissed.
            "
"1337","Almost 3 months of using the S9, and I have had zero problems with the phone. I upgraded from a S4 (which I'd still be using except some needed apps were no longer being updated for the S4). I don't like the Bixby button. Love the phone. The lilac is a great color.
            "
"1338","This is a fantastic cell phone! I had a KG which absolutely SUCKED. I was so happy to go back to my zSamsung like before. Don't even think about trying something else, just stay with the moving est THE SAMSUNG ""S9"" you won't be sorry. Thank you Samsung.
            "
"1339","Phone was received in OEM packaging. Much better screen and fingerprint scanner than the S7. The camera is amazing and has very good macro close up shots.
            "
"1340","I was a little nervous to buy something like this online, but it saved me more than $200 to buy it this way and everything works fine. It did take the Sprint store a little playing with it to get it working, but not a big deal. I am very happy with this purchase.
            "
"1341","Delivered timely and as expected. Worked with StraightTalk without an issue. The only unexpected issue was that the S9 takes a nano sim card, which my old phone did not so I had to get a new card; but I'll chalk that up to shame on me for not catching that before buying.
            "
"1342","I was hesitant to upgrade from my Galaxy S5, since everything is going 5G next summer, but I really, really needed a new phone, and this one is just right: lovely color, not too big, not too small, great screen, good camera, with all the power and storage I need.
            "
"1343","I cannot say much. There are many reviews of Galaxy S9. My opinion is that this phone is most modern and luxury these days. I love everything about this device. Great camera, awesome software, fast and productive, easy to use and reliable smartphone. I like it and would recommend this phone.
            "
"1344","My previous phone was a samsung s6 with 64 GB storage. After 3-year usage, my old phone ran more and more sluggish, and also ran out of space. This Samsung s9 is definitely a vast improvement over s6, in terms of speed. However, I haven't noticed any difference in camera or sound quality. The face recognition doesn't work in dim light. And since I wear eye glasses normally and set up the face recognition with eye glasses, it doesn't recognize me when I don't wear glasses.
            "
"1345","The Galaxy S9 Plus works with GSM and CDMA networks. Phone is fast and picture quality is amazing. I have been using it for 4 months now and has not slowed down. Battery life is not very long, but you can extend it if you use ""Battery Saving"" mode. Great phone overall.
            "
"1346","The phone has not had any issues, except for the lack of wifi calling, which I recently figured out aboard a cruise, which made it a pain in the butt not being able to use my phone for calls. Had to switch back and forth to my work phone, an S7 to do wifi calling.
            "
"1347","Very pleased with responsiveness, ease in moving apps from S5 to S9 and battery life. Have not used Bixby enough to have opinion
            "
"1348","I'm calling this an average phone because of the value proposition. It's expensive, but nothing real special and there are issues with notifications.  Also mine showed up unsealed from amazon.
            "
"1349","The sound gets a bit distorted all the way up with dolby atmos, amazing camera, love the finger sensor, very fast and smooth, long battery for daily use, great for multi tasking, all round perfect phone. Very slim and light, and beautiful
            "
"1350","This phone is beyond amazing.  I love love love it. It takes selfies really good. The speaker is the best I came across on a phone. You would think you added an external speaker.  And when you find out the things you can do with it, you'll wonder why you didnt buy it sooner.
            "
"1351","Great phone that is unlocked. It works for verizon as well. Best price for this phone was $740 on amazon. Compared to best buy and verizon they all wanted 950 and why bother at that point might as well get the newest samsung note 9 for $1,000. The battery life will last you all day with regular use and with the quick charging feature its nice. You can charge it up from like 50% to 100% in like a hour.
            "
"1352","I purchased this device to replace my other S9 that had been destroyed. Came packaged well and presented as brand new. Had NO problems at all linking this to old accounts, contacts, etc. before activating the phone service.Took the phone to Verizon, activation took less than 10 minutes with NO hiccups. I'd certainly recommend this supplier.
            "
"1353","I like the phone however, the battery doesn't last long and it gets very hot. Overall the phone is ok and i really like it a lot, i wish the battery would last longer and it didn't get so hot. Am still learning, this is my first Samsung phone
            "
"1354","At first I was sent a display phone. No SIM card slot was present and it felt super light. After the exchange it's working well!
            "
"1355","I accidentally ordered this phone.....it was very nice and brand new, but I returned it with a no hassle return on my money.
            "
"1356","Although in the announcement is stated that is an unlocked phone, it comes with Verizon App  that keeps asking to connect to a Verizon network, it work with another operator, but I wanted a fully unlocked phone.
            "
"1357","Advertized unlocked, but came loaded with AT&T stuff.
            "
"1358","This S9 doesn't seem too different than the S7 but I like how it fits in my hand better. Picture quality is above the S7.The only thing I don't like is that the phone is a little slippery but a good phone case usually solves that problem.
            "
"1359","i own this phone since January 1st, 2019, it worked fine (audio quality on a voice call is kinda bad) and yesterday, when i was doing my job, being on-call, it just died on me - THE BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH. I tried all the ways to restart it, nothing worked. I wonder if samsung can be sued if i lose my job because of this shitty phone
            "
"1360","Worst battery ever life. Upgraded from s9 to s9 plus thinking I would get better photos and extended battery life. But this phone is worse in all aspects. Battery on s9 used to last whole day but this one dies in 14 hrs with same usage!! Picture quality is also not that phenomenal
            "
"1361","I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my mother. Setup was easy. Had to take it to a Sprint store to get it activated. The associate was able to transfer her data over from the old phone to this phone. Afterwards, my mother hasn't had any issues with it. She loves it.
            "
"1362","Bought to use with AT&T & loved that it didn't carry all of their bulky unnecessary apps.
            "
"1363","I work 12 hours overnight and I can charge this at home while I sleep, then come to work and use it however I wish while tethering all night long and the battery might hit 40%
            "
"1364","The phone itself is great, good size.  The android software is good but more complicated than my old S5 phone.  You have to dig to find the correct settings.  I don't always get notifications when messages arrive even though the tones and volume levels are set.  I do like the better picture quality and sound quality.
            "
"1365","No one told me I couldn't get wifi calling on this phone bcz its unlocked
            "
"1366","Very easy to handle and it is much faster than my previous phone. The camera takes very clear, sharp photos. I highly recommend.
            "
"1367","I only use it for its camera, calendar, Waze, and YouTube...SMS and calls too!  You can't get rid of the annoying Bixby and Samsung bloatware.
            "
"1368","The battery life on this phone is a disappointment. Other than that it's one of the best phone in 2018. Amazing performance, excellent camera, fast LTE, wireless charging, etc.
            "
"1369","This phone is a great upgrade from my s6.
            "
"1370","Phone works great have been using Samsung products for a while now my last phone the S7 edge was a good phone the S9 plus out does that
            "
"1371","This is my most favorite phone! I can do so much with it. It was super simple to activate it with my carrier, I literally popped in my activated SIM card and was off and running. I have had it a few weeks now and I still keep finding more and more things to do with my phone. The purple color is amazing! I got mine as part of a bundle and still haven't used all the pieces. Great value too!
            "
"1372","The S9 is the defacto standard of what a mobile phone should be in 2018.  I skipped over the S9 to wait for Pixel 3.  Big mistake because I could have been enjoying this phone many months ago.
            "
"1373","Bixby can be a bit annoying but other than that it's a great phone.
            "
"1374","After reading bad comments I was afraid that I¡¯m going to get fake phone, but turned out that the phone is authentic and great!!! And  the price is better than even at Best Buy.
            "
"1375","Recently got this refurbished S9 and compared to my prior phone, a Samsung Galaxy S5, this one is a gem. Super-fast processor, beautiful design and tons of space.
            "
"1376","Been a galaxy owner for years now there's nothing special about this one from the rest I these phones are expensive and I have yet to be wowed on any cell phone wont be upgrading no time soon until then
            "
"1377","Just had to put my verizon sim card in, works great. Bought this for my daughter, now she has the best phone in the house. Fast, good screen, very happy
            "
"1378","Speaker is clear but too loud. Pretty purple lilac. Came with all cables headphones. Came early by Amazon with Gatorade in some box. Used to like apple but this keyboard is better.
            "
"1379","Wow, I upgraded from a HTC One MO and I am just blown away by how much clearer the screen is, how responsive the touch is, and all the new features. Fantastic phone thus far. I only had issues with trying to find a case and screen protector that were comparable with each other, but I stuck with just a really hefty case in the end.
            "
"1380","This phone is a Verizon phone, even thought it was listed as unlocked. Verizon does not work in our area. Just because it's an unlocked phone doesn't mean it can be used with any carrier. Therefore I have to return it.
            "
"1381","Great phone. Very good battery life. Fast. Great pictures. Replaced a Galaxy s7. My only complaint is that it's made from glass and needs a very strong case.
            "
"1382","Esperaba mas del telefono, no estoy seguro que sea original. Lo compare un poco con otros del mismo modelo y creo que la camara no es la misma.
            "
"1383","It said is unlocked but i cant activate with boost mobile <U+0001F621><U+0001F621><U+0001F621><U+0001F621><U+0001F621><U+0001F621> and the reviews said that can <U+0001F5A4><U+0001F5A4><U+0001F5A4>
            "
"1384","Worth the money for the impressive camara.Hands down the best mobile quality you can get for under the 1K budget
            "
"1385","Loving the curve and the fact that it is water resistant and has expandable memory is perfect, but not a big fan of the battery.
            "
"1386","This phone works on Verizon and At&t or Tmobile if you already have an active account/ SIM card. People who say it doesn't work on certain networks are simply bugs or bots. I have Verizon it works and I love the phone
            "
"1387","Easily activated with my wireless provider. Battery will last most of the day, I am constantly checking emails etc so very happy I dont have to live connected to a charger.
            "
"1388","I was a hardcore iphone person. My son talked me into trying the Galaxy s9 plus....I will never go back to an iphone!!
            "
"1389","Phone is alright. Still not sure about the phone since it lags sometimes and takes a while to fully charge. Seems like a defect. Crashes apps a few times already..
            "
"1390","This phone does not have the features on it that the S6 had
            "
"1391","I am most dissatisfied with how fast the battery wears down. I have a much cheaper version of Samsung that battery life is much better.
            "
"1392","by far the best phone on the market for 2018.  10 times better than the iPhone.
            "
"1393","Love the new GS9 plus. Brand new from zeroforfive. Had to pay for shipping but it was worth it for the great deal on this amazing phone.
            "
"1394","Had a Galaxy S5 and this is such an upgrade. Battery really lasts a long time and response time is very nice. Still learning a lot of the features.
            "
"1395","So far so good. Purchased as a replacement for my laggy s7 active. Though I would've preferred an s8 active had Samsung continued that series
            "
"1396","Happy, Happy, Happy! Recommended that you still use a pin number or the finger scanner to unlock your phone and security pay type apps. The iris scanner has difficulties if you wear glasses! The facial recognition software works about 50 to 75 percent of the time
            "
"1397","Great phone. Screen clarity is great. Sound is really good. Battery life is good; not great, but holds up pretty well over a day.
            "
"1398","This phone is beautiful to look at, feels like a quality product in your hand, is fast, the battery lasts forever and has the latest tech available.  Would definitely recommend.

"1401","Single SIM. Excellent phone. I highly recommend it. Battery life is OK, it's just that I would like it to be 2 full days... :-)
            "
"1402","es bueno pero realmente si tienes el s7 edge espera a nuevos dipocitivos  no es un gran cambio y diferencia a comparacion con la vieja generacion 89%up.
            "
"1403","I received this phone in perfect condition, brand new, despite all the negative reviews! I haven't used it long enough to review all features, but I  do like Bixby, and it was easy to set up.
            "
"1404","Did not like that I couldn¡¯t add apps from my service provider, what¡¯s the purpose of buying an unlocked phone if you can¡¯t add apps that are used.  My service provider wouldn¡¯t add the apps because I didn¡¯t buy the phone from them, which by the way cost $300 more than I paid for it!  Sucks!
            "
"1405","Upgraded to this after using 6 years of Sony phones. Blows anything Sony has made recently out of the water. Also, no notch and a headphone jack!!
            "

"1414","Wouldn't recommend.  Less than. Six months old and require the charging port to be replaced.
            "
"1415","so far no problems , I love it very nice, fair price excellent phone, minor scratches , but is worthy.
            "
"1416","It works well. Major improvement over my S5.  More features than I need, or care to use.  The camera is amazing crisp.

"1420","Best phone I ever had I love it so much.Samsung dominates iPhone if you don't mind being creative and curious.
            "
"1421","Phone arrived quickly but the aftermarket charger plug was less than subpar. It was quick to heat up, thankfully I have others to use. The phone wasn't loaded with carrier bloatware and was easy for me to connect to my carrier.
            "
"1422","Stoked!!!! Great deal this phone looks and acts brand new. I saved so much from not buying a brand new phone. Highly recommend!!!!!
            "
"1423","Overall, this phone is fast and has the display offered by any flagship phone. I appreciate the full super AMOLED display without an annoying notch getting in the way. Super thin bezels are barely noticeable and I don't mind the Bixby button since I just remapped it for Google Assistant.
            "
"1424","no scratches or anything, battery life was great, worked like a charm.
            "
"1425","Great phone just make sure to reset location. Thought I was in China and restricted some of my apps

"1429","Love the size of the phone, edge feature is fabulous,  fantastic,  great  value.
            "
"1430","This phone could not be activated by T-Mobile.  The IMEI number on the box did not match the IMEI numbers of the phone. And none of the IMEI numbers could be registered on a network.  This supposed new, unlocked phone had also previously been registered according to T-Mobile.

"1444","Bought this phone to replace my Droid Turbo after years of use, and I'm very happy with this one. In comparison to the other phones I've had, this one takes about 30 seconds to restart itself (which is wonderful if you're someone who usually only restarts it when it's absolutely needed). The picture quality is awesome as well as the sound quality. However, if you're playing music on full volume, there is a bit of a tinny noise in the background if it goes to a super loud part. I love the battery life, but be careful not to leave it plugged in after it fully charges to avoid shortening it. My biggest complaint is probably the case out of everything (which I realize isn't really the phone but kinda has to do with it). You see, this phone has a curved screen (which is unique but kinda a pain in the butt) and the way that Otterbox designs their cases for it, the screen protector piece is just a thick plastic part with adhesive which doesn't tuck into the sides of the case. While maybe this wouldn't be such a huge problem on flat screens, the curved screen made it ridiculous since the protector kept sliding and popping off. But if you can deal with that, I say go for it.Lastly, I know someone have had issues with activating it, but to be honest, I didn't run into any problems. I just brought it into Verizon and had them hook it up. I spent about ten minutes in the store overall.

I see some people are unhappy that carrier visual voicemail is unavailable from the play store for this unlocked phone (and the s8) but it IS possible to get it working. I installed it from another source, called up carrier with sim imei and iccid and 2 min later visual voicemail was working great.  I might buy another one for myself.

            "
"1537","Had a J3V, decided to move into the big girl arena and get an S9.  Did my research and figured I could do the work to replace my phone with my current carrier instead of paying them to do the work.  I had to have a friend of mine show me how to access the sim/micro sd card port.  Switched them out, turned on the phone.  It walked me through how to attach the included cable and attachment to my j3v.  Transferred and Bam! It works.  Went out to my carriers website and already show up.  No problems.  The only thing you can not do with your carrier (you should check with yours) is that you can not get insurance on a phone unless purchased through your carrier.  That being said, if I choose to get another phone, I will definitely be buying an unlocked one from here again.
            "

"1556","After years of not using Samsung's top-of-the-food-chain devices, I finally gave it a shot with the S9 Plus. Unfortunately, I had to return the device next day.THE GOOD:Samsung still has excellent built quality and clever features that make their devices unique. I especially fell in love with the DeX feature. Being able to turn your phone into a fully functioning desktop computer is just cool and amazing. I first got introduced to this kind of feature on a Huawei Mate 10 Pro (which I also had to return for other reasons). Once I actually got exposed to the DeX, I knew I wanted it in my life.Samsung's displays are just amazing and unrivaled! I doubt I have to say more. :)The camera was ok. For some reason, it didn't live up to the hype; at least not in my opinion. Compared to my Pixel 2 XL pictures, the ones taken with the Samsung were way too bright, sometimes over exposed, looked rather soft and lacked depth / details. In this days and age, that's nitpicking, I know. All top tier phones take great pictures. It doesn't matter which phone you get, every single one of them will take great pictures while letting you down in one or another department.THE ""DOESN'T MATTER MUCH BUT STILL ANNOYING"":Samsung's launcher (user interface) has improved a lot. I still don't really care for it but I could at least have lived with it. I hate how all the settings have been moved around and how you have to search for them in spots where you would never have expected them. For instance WiFi Calling. Why is that in the settings of the phone app rather than under Network and Connectivity?Pre-installed apps are just as annoying today as they were a few years back. Granted, this days, it isn't as much as it used to be but why not making them uninstallable rather than baking them into the OS? I know I can disable an app, however, I would prefer if it isn't there in the first place!Samsung's need to duplicate virtually all and any of Google's services is, in my opinion, a waste of resources and it doesn't make their platform more attractive. Why do I need a Samsung Clock app that doesn't do any more than the default Android Clock app? Why do I need a Samsung Phone app where the default Android Phone app is just fine? Same goes for Samsung Mail, Samsung Calendar and a bunch more. If I could at least remove them and replace them with the stock Android apps, I would be more inclined to buy a Samsung phone.Bixby is a whole other story! From the get-go, I had no intention of using Samsung's assistant. Yet, here she was, right in my face. I could deactivate her on the home screen, however, there was no way of deactivating the assistant entirely. I remembered that the Bixby button (which I hit multiple times already by accident) could be deactivated. Yeah, sure! You first have to create a Samsung account, then configure Bixby just to be able to finally click on a settings icon in Bixby and deactivate the hardware button. I don't know who thought of this nonsense!As mentioned, I would have been able to live with the above. Annoying (to me), yes, but I could live with it.THE BAD:The most important thing on the phone simply doesn't work right: network reception! I got 1 to 0 bars of mobile reception where every other phone in the house got at least 3. I constantly lost network. Researching this problem online, I learnt that this has been an issue with all of Samsung's high end devices since the Oreo update. The forums across the globe are filled with user complaints. The German Samsung forum, for example, has 59 pages of users complaining about network reception issues on the S8, S8+, Note 8, S9 and S9+. This has been going on since February, it seems. Users state that their phones were fine with Android 7.x but since the Oreo update, everything is a mess.Strangely, this also affects WiFi calling, too. I wasn't able to place a single call without either fading out conversations or mute calls. There are a gazillion sites out there claiming to have the fix for this issues but none of them actually work. Samsung has yet to acknowledge the problem. Instead, they blame your network provider and make you hard reset your device. If that doesn't help, they will offer you to exchange your brand new device with a refurbished one under warranty - at least that's what they offered me! In between, Samsung issued an update to improve network stability but, looking around in the web, that didn't seem to have solved the problem.Regardless, a phone that can't even do the basic task of being a phone is useless to me, so, I returned mine.

I am satisfied with the phone. It provides several super powerful features to improve experience of daily usage.Only one improvement which Samsung could make is to seal product boxes to protect customer's experience of unboxing.

"1574","This phone is nothing short of amazing! It's my first top of the line premium phone, and I never knew, until now, what I'd been missing. It is blazing fast, the screen resolution is fantastic, and it can do so many things that I will be constantly discovering new functions. The dual speakers with the Dolby Atmos, sound so absolutely terrific, it's amazing that Samsung can pack so much sound into such small speakers. My last Samsung phone was a Galaxy Mega with the 6.3"" screen, and I loved the huge screen on it, and that is my only lament about the S9+, it has a 6.2"" screen, so you'd think it isn't that much smaller, but it is quite a bit smaller. Not length-wise, but smaller by a bunch height-wise, and I've missed that on every phone I've had since. That is the one thing that would make the S9+ absolutely perfect for me, a screen that big, but, I'll live without it in exchange for how great the rest of this phone is. I highly recommend this phone if you can possibly afford it, it's really outstanding.

It's not too bulky, I have no problems using it with one hand.The camera is awesome. I've been playing with it since I got it out of the box!I'm still getting used to the new operating system and layout. I've been used to the Galaxy's home button, and the back and multi-screen buttons, so it's interesting adapting to a completely smooth device.Where the apps icon was on the home screen, is now the camera icon. If you're upgrading like I did, you have to flick upwards to get to the apps. But this is not, in any way, a downside.The speakers are great, and listening to music through earphones is awesome.I absolutely love this new phone! I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new phone!
            "
"1583","This is the best phone your money can buy. Perfect camera, Perfect processor, Perfect phone. 10x better than iPhone X.  I can not recommend the S9+ or Samsung enough! iPhone is for kids and old people. Samsung is for anyone who understands technology and doesn't try to fit in with the brands and images- but sets trends and knows they're cool.

Most of the Samsung bloatware is less insidious than I expected. It came properly packaged with all the standard accessories. I added a body case and a wireless charger. With all the cutting edge features, the great camera, and the sturdy build, this is as close to perfect as any phone I have ever owned.

"1597","This is just more fun than anyone needs to have.  Change the SIM and the memory card and travel the world without getting lost or missing out on anything.  Don't speak the language?  There is an app for that!  Don't know where to find yourself?  GPS your location.  Life is good.

"1599","Worked perfectly! Got my S6 converted to the S9+. I needed a new SIM card from Verizon, so had to go to the store just to get a free SIM card. Also, I went with a screen protector and case, feels much better with it.The phone doesn't feel too large. Bixby can be ignored, just OK Google it! Definitively a huge improvement from the S6.

"1600","Coming over from a Nexus 6p and I'm starting to realize how outdated my phone really was. The screen on this phone is amazing. Camera is awesome, and the headphones that come with the box are surprisingly decent. The phone and its settings are very customizableand that's something I really love. The resolution on the phone is absolutely beautiful. One of the best displays that I've ever seen. Batterylife is pretty good so far as well.Going to continue playing playing around with the phone and provide updates to whatever happens either positive or negative with my phone. But so far it's great!

"1601","This phone is great and awesome. Super fast for playing games as well. Only reason I had to return this is because my gf is selling me hers (she's an iPhone fan). Otherwise, I will definitely be keeping the phone for a few years.

"1602","I absolutely love my new phone. Samsung hit it out of the park with the S9+. It has every feature, detail, options, and specifics that you could possibly want. When considering whether to purchase this phone, I researched all of the other top rated phones. I truly feel this is the best phone available at this time. Yes, the downfall may be the price. But, I truly believe in the saying, ""You get what you pay for."" The price I paid through Amazon was AT LEAST $50-100 US dollars cheaper than anywhere else. The wrap around full-screen is phenomenal. The camera capability is so good that I don't need to take a separate camera with me any longer. If you have the money, GET IT!!!

"1625","I got this phone last month to replace my old iPhone, as I was tired of Apple for a variety of reasons. I was impressed with the picture quality and, reading the reviews, I convinced myself to switch to the Gallaxy S9. When I first received it, I loved it - and this would be a very different review if I wrote it then. But I live in Europe and soon the problems started to show. No Samsung Pay - at all. I checked everywhere and no one has an answer on how to fix that. Then the camera started freezing. It wouldn't go from selfie to portrait nor from camera to gallery without needing a restart. I now just left Samsung's flagship shop in London to find out what to do. Turns out my ONLY choice is to send it back to America and hope for the best. So if you live abroad, know certain features on your phone just will not work and if you ever need assistance, you flat out won't get it.
            "
"1626","I tried out a Samsung a few years ago, the S6 actually, and I really couldn't get into their take on Android. TouchWiz, as they called it was a mess, full of unwanted bloatware and a jerky-jerky feel to the software that turned me off. The battery life was horrible on the phone too, which was why I returned mine for an exchange within the two-week grace period. The 7 tempted me and the 8, but something kept telling me to go with iPhone or another Android instead.I jump around with my phones quite a lot--I've used every imaginable playform and several different phones--I am not a 'fanboy' of any OS or brand. There are things I love about iOS and things I love about Android. Those love/hate aspects are the biggest reasons I can't fully commit to either ecosystem and why I am switching phones like a lunatic every year. This past year, I used the Essential Phone which, through constant updates and fixes, finally became a good little phone by the end. However, switching to the S9, I feel like I've gone from roughing it to living in luxury. Take a moment and check out my review below.HardwareThis thing is a beauty. Seriously. It¡¯s refined and though it is basically the same design as the S8, for my money it¡¯s still the best-looking phone on the market. I would like it to be a teensy bit wider, as the screen appears every-so-slightly too narrow, but really that¡¯s nit-picking to the extreme. The feel in your hand is fantastic and looks like it should be expensive.Yes, the headphone jack is still present<U+2014>Samsung would have to eat far too many of their own words to remove that little feature. However, so many other companies are doing away with it, one wonders just how long Samsung will keep this stubbornness up. Personally, I would gladly do away with it in exchange for a bigger battery<U+2014>something this phone sorely needs. Maybe someday. I¡¯m sure Apple has a whole campaign of told-you-so commercials just waiting for that day to come. The S9 does come with a fast charging adapter and a great pair of headphones.The external speakers are fantastic, a big step above what they've had in the past. They harken back to the old HTC One in terms of sound quality, and they might even do that phone one better. The volume is loud with little distortion, except for at the very highest levels.The screen is, well, the best you can buy. Samsung has perfected screens and everyone else is just playing catchup. The colors are bright, and the images are crisp. It does inspire a lot of oohing and ahhhing that¡¯s for sure.Inside, the S9 has all the goods you would expect in a 2018 flagship phone. Sporting a Snapdragon 845 process, this baby is smooth and fast as can be. I've never used a phone with such a quick response to commands. The base model comes with 64gb of storage and the option to add a ridiculous amount of extra storage with an SD card. You can also buy options with 128GB or 256GB, but given it's expandable, I see little reason to go with the larger storage models.The 4GB of memory might disappoint some people, but the vast majority of users will never feel the difference. However, if you disagree, there's always the S9+ or Note 9, both of which have more memory.Overall, this phone has everything you want in a flagship smartphone, in terms of both design and power.SoftwareI can say, though there is still much room for refinement, Samsung has done a great job with its current software. Unlike the S6 and S8 I used before, this baby isn¡¯t bogged down by near as many redundancies and bloatware. Oh, the bloatware is still there, no doubt. But it all works together better than ever before. I¡¯m still sifting through just how much of this stuff I really need, but after the barebones pure Android experience of Essential Phone, I am enjoying the endless possibilities afforded by Samsung¡¯s interconnected experience.And then we come to Bixby. Poor little Bixby. I don¡¯t know why Samsung is sticking with this thing<U+2014>in its current form, even after updates, it¡¯s not good, nor is it anywhere near as useful as the Google assistant. The swipe right screen, which is Bixby¡¯s home, is still a clunky mess. I¡¯d much prefer to have the usual Google home screen there instead. It feels like a lot of wasted space.Bixby takes a while to load up when you call it and frequently misses words or mistakes words. When you ask it a question, it more often than not pulls up a web search list. That¡¯s not good enough when Google¡¯s assistant is available too and far better at retrieving information and reading it to you. Right now this thing is not even as useful as Siri, and that¡¯s saying something.Fortunately, Bixby is easily ignored. Samsung Pay more than makes up for it. The ability to pay through NFC almost anywhere is amazing.Unlike previous incarnations, Samsung¡¯s refinements and additions to Android feel complimentary now. Having used pure stock Android for the previous year, I can say these tweaks are welcome and make the experience feel more united, rather than a collection of separate apps.CameraWow. That¡¯s all I can say. I know, I know, the S9+ has a dual camera setup. I get that, but it¡¯s also more expensive and a lot larger. Don¡¯t knock the camera on the S9<U+2014>it takes amazing photos, especially in low light, and the videos are eye-catching. This baby even takes good portrait-style photos with the blurry background and all. And slow-motion mode is breath-taking. If you want a great camera, the S9 is one of the best out there. Sure, there are miniscule nit-picks to the photo quality compared to the + and to the iPhone X, but no one will go through your photos so closely to even notice.Trust me. You will love this camera.Battery LifeThis is a major disappointment. The battery on the S9 is the same one they used last year, from what I¡¯ve read, and it desperately needed an upgrade. The batter life is horrendous for a flagship phone, and it's the biggest reason I have to give 4 stars instead of 5. A real shame. If you're a power user, you might want to find another phone, because you'll be shocked by just how quickly this phone dies.The ExperienceThis is where it all comes together. Your phone may have super duper specs on the inside and fancy features in the software, or a crazy good dual camera, but the experience you have while using your phone is really what determines your opinion. I have never had an experience like the one I'm having with the Galaxy S9. I feel a connection to it, which I know may sound odd, but it's true.The PIE update, with One UI added, has been a revelation. Truly, it almost feels like I have a brand new phone now. I'm loving the look, feel, and smoothness of the operation. It's a stunning update.The little things Samsung offers, like alternate skins and themes for the interface, allow you to make it your own. They personalize your device and give you a sense of ownership. And above all, this phone just works and works extremely well. It's a joy to use no matter what I'm doing. In terms of the user experience, I've never felt quite this satisfied with any device. If only the battery life didn't rain on my parade!VerdictI¡¯m happy with this phone and the PIE and One UI updates have been incredible. This is a flagship phone, no doubt about it, and you¡¯ll be very pleased if you go with it. The camera is top-of-the-line, the software is smooth and fantastic, and the screen is the best you can buy. Get it! I think you'll love it.

"1631","I love the item and it made it on time
            "
"1632","I'm upgrading from a bricked Nexus 5X so the performance and feel of this phone is leaps and bounds beyond what I'm used to.  I've been using Google phones for a number of years so I was concerned about Samsung wrecking the UI.  But after disabling Bixby and its button, it's pretty much back to working like vanilla Android as far as I'm concerned.I like the ""infinity screen"" for the fact that it increases screen size without greatly increasing the size of the phone.  My 5X is only a bit smaller than the S9+!My biggest complaint, and the reason I'm giving 4/5 stars is for the exterior feel of this phone - it's very very slippery!  The 5X has a rubberized coating that makes it easy to pick up and hold and also not slide off of surfaces, I greatly miss that.  For example when I navigate while driving I put the phone on my right knee.  This new phone immediately slides right off.  I'm definitely going to get some kind of case or grippy skin for it.I am using this phone on a Red Pocket plan with Verizon service.
            "
"1633","Like the title says... I was using an iPhone 5c which was incredibly slow thanks to apple purposefully making it damn near impossible to use after the last and final update they sent me about a year ago.  I'll break down what I like and do not like about this phone though:Pros - slim, shiny, beautiful screen, fast response times from everything to opening the phone to the apps I use as well as the internet.  If has built in facial and iris recognition and allows you have the alternative option of putting a code or password into the phone to open it.  (Honestly I highly recommend choosing a backup option to unlock the phone because although the facial and iris recognition is great, it's not flawless especially if you're wearing a costume, heavy makeup, etc.) The sound is great and the quality of the photos is amazing compared to what I had before.Cons: the phone is much heavier than what I am used to or what I had expected.  The camera, although great when you're far away, has absolutely awful quality (much worse than my old iPhone) when you zoom in.  The price for the phone was about average.  I found this to be a better deal than the Google XL 2, or the iPhone X which in my opinion were both overpriced, however I still think 760 with taxes is a little much for a phone, especially one that didn't introduce anything new to the market that wasn't already out there and available with other products and companies.  Lastly, if you are an iOS user and are considering switching to android like I did, heed my warning, because I can't put this in larger letters if I tried: DO NOT FORGET TO DEACTIVATE YOUR IMESSAGES.  if you do not deactivate them, you will NOT be able to receive imessages (texts) from ANY iPhone or iPad user.  I ran into a huge issue with this and even though I was incredibly careful, I STILL had to visit the apple webpage to manually deactivate my apple account in order to fix the issue.All in all, I am very happy with my purchase.P.S.: note that if you are changing from iOS to android, you may also run into a problem transferring apps and logging back into any cross phone / platform games that you were playing.  I had to find work around and contact account recovery due to apple using game center vs. Android using Google and Facebook.  I highly suggest you link any games you can't live without to Facebook or gmail prior to switching devices or you will find yourself switching back and forth between devices several times to resolve the issue.
            "
"1634","Phone arrived on time a and in good conditionIt might be somewhat louder than the 8plus, but not much. The phone itself appears to simply be an s7 with two speakers. The glowing reviews of the camera might be accurate but my purchase wasn't guided by taking selfies. The camera is secondary to me. An overall great phone but doesn't live up to the hype.
            "

It took two weeks, they didn't replace the phone,  instead they ""fixed"" my phone.  It now is worst than before. They also damaged the exterior of my phone and kept my accessories. Only solution they keep offering is top send it in yet again to be fixed.  No matter how many times I send it in, they will not replace the phone.

            "
"1650","Do NOT buy an S9 if you use T-Mo and plan to go overseas. Samsung has a very bad pop-up message that wants you to switch out of roaming, but you need to be in roaming when traveling with T-Mo. The pop-up can't be disabled and opens about 50 times a day. This has been a known issue since November 2017 and Samsung hasn't done anything about it.
            "
"1651","I wound up returning this phone. I HATED it. In no way did it justify it's cost. The Huawei Mate SE is much, much better. Granted, the screen quality isn't quite as good, nor is the camera. However, the software is better thought out and implemented and, as such, much more user oriented and modifiable. I used the S9+ for about a week and went back to the Mate SE. I was much, much happier until (lo and behold) I received an S9+ as a gift. Now I use the S9+ just so I won't hurt someone's feelings. Karma better remember this.BTW, who was the idiot that placed the fingerprint sensor right underneath the camera lenses? You always wind up smudging them when you scan your print.The S9+ is one poorly designed phone.UPDATE : The hell with karma. I went back to the Huawei Mate SE. I can be nice for only so long.
            "
"1652","This is a pretty good smartphone.  The camera still struggles under low light conditions, but that's true of all smartphones.  Beyond that, nice display, water resistant, it's not much different than any of the recent competitors,  or even those one or two generations out of date.  So, no 4 or 5 stars.  If you own an S6 or equivalent  there really isn't five or six hundred dollars worth of difference here.  It's not less money and doesn't do anything all that much better.  It has two drawbacks.  First, is Samsung's proprietary bloatware and manipulation of Android.  For that reason alone, this is my last Samsung phone.  Second, and really objectionable, is the worthless Bixby. It does nothing for the user.  It is extremely limited in its ability to customize. It only gets about 10% of voice commands/requests correct.  Google is far better.  And, Samsung is so smitten by its worthless Bixby feature it installed a button just below the volume rocker to turn it on. It's very easy to press the stupid Bixby button while trying to change the volume.  In short, who needs to upgrade?  For what?  A marginally better snapshot camera?  A reliable (for a change) battery?  For Bixby?  I bought this phone because my S6 was just about done and I had to change phones to use Xfinity anyway. Unless you have to get a new phone, ask yourself,  regardless of brand, do you really have nothing better to do with $500 to $1000+?

The phone was dropping calls and if I made a call out they can't hear me. Plus the mute will not 'unmute'. I had no problems till last week. Past the return date. I paid too much for a phone that does not work. On the internet I searched and millions of others are having the same issues. Read that a fix is promised. But when???????

"1655","Just google s9+ poor phone reception and you will see what I'm dealing with.  Brand new phone, bought on this link on prime day.  Would not recommend or buy again, ever.  Last samsung phone, that's certain.  Unfortunately, reliability has been declining with each new model samsung phone and I made a mistake ""upgrading"" my s7 edge.  Fortunately, I still have my s7. The rating for this phone is undeserving, should be around 3 stars at best.  Bixby is the most annoying thing ever and I miss the home button.  Cool phone if you have hours to burn tinkering with it to get it to function.  WIFI calling on VERIZON will NOT work with this unlocked us version phone.  Cool fact to find out AFTER purchase.  2 stars because it's pretty.  Also, difficult to use one handed vs the s7 edge.  Final verdict: JUNK.  Message to SAMSUNG: How dare you release such unreliable tech and call it your FLAGSHIP phone?

"1657","iPhone user and totally converted after trying S9+. Bought EU model with Equinios processor, 256 GB internal memory and 400 GB SD card. I need it for shooting video and 656 GB of available memory I have finally no problem.Camera is to die for, love colors and depth, comparable to iPhone X, so iPhone lost its prevous advantage.Display is the best currently available on any smartphone. Samsung definitely leads the game here.Sounds is stereo with Dolby, what makes it way more pleasant than iPhoneX currently.In terms of speed, it is maybe because of software, I do not play games, but for everything else I feel that Galaxy S9+ is faster than iPhone. 6 GB RAM makes lot of sense, as well.It really feels like fast computer and going back to anything slower is painful.Fast charging and wireless fast charging are added bonuses, it takes few short hours and works perfect.At current price for global market models (2 SIM cards, faster processor, 256 GB memory) and I paid 930 $, it is way better proposition than iPhone X. It is much cheaper to pay 100% for the phone and pick some smarter plan than to buy on monthly plan. Do the math.Bottom line, as convert from Apple, I may witness that Galaxy is truly an achievement, design, quality, functionality and reliability. It is all there now.

"1658","I purchased a s9+ about a month ago from Samsung , this phone and all the phones that have Bixby have a system Virus that Samsung tells me you can not remove. This is why it is a virus, it installs itself you can turn it off but it will reinstall itself and turn itself back on. When it does that it gives complete access to everything on your phone if you accidently hit the button on the side or swipe left. and it can't be stopped according to Samsung customer service.This virus is bad, ""REAL BAD""  unless of course you do not mind sharing all you phone numbers , emails , texts call history email addresses, photos , videos , etc.I love the phone it is the best camera I have seen, but the phone itself stinks, because of this virus.if you accidentally pick up the phone and press the button or swipe too far left  Bang! the virus is back in 6 different places and all your personal data is accessible to the virus even though you spent the time to turn  the VIRUS off in the 6 places and remove permissions ,  one little slip of the finger and the virus is back in full force.I have no Idea why Samsung would insist on accessing my personal information when I have tried to disable their virus software BIXBY , and it still propagates back on the phone.Samsung told me it is not a virus, what is the definition of a virus, my thoughts are , if it is something you can not stop from propagating in the OS , and It has full access to everything on your phone , and once deleted or deactivated propagates itself back on the phone, and again gives full access to you personal files and information to the Virus called ""BIXBY""

"1659","I am thrilled so far.I have had this phone for only a week, so time will tell what longevity will hold for me.I can honestly say that if the phone I own now, is still 'acting' like the same phone 6-months or a year from now (in regards to not developing glitches/issues), that it will be the best phone I have ever owned.I have never and will never own an Iphone, and I have never been a samsung anything guy in the past either. I have never liked samsung electronics (always found them 'cheaper' than competitor products). My first samsung phone 20 years ago (flip phone) was complete rubbish. My Son's Galaxy 5 (or 6?) was a nightmare. THIS PHONE however, has won me over.- Reception - best.- App speed - best.- Battery - very good.- Glitchiness - none.- Voice quality - very good.- Visuals - outstanding.The ONLY thing NOT superior on this phone vs my last is sound. I have had HTC flagship phones in  the past couple of years and they are way ahead of their time with speaker/voice/sound quality. The bar was set very high with the HTC and I never expected the Galaxy to match it, nevermind beat it, BUT the Galaxy makes a valiant effort. I will miss that sound with my old phone, but if that is the only thing I have to sacrifice for an otherwise far superior phone, I can live with that.Only other concern I have is that the responsiveness to the screen, with or without a screen protector sometimes has me thinking it is not capturing my finger taps and swipes, but it is very minor (for now). I have read reviews where this has become a major issue for some so i will need to keep an eye out for that.I will post back after some time of using this phone to inform if it is still holding up to this gleaming review.I am on T-mobile with this phone as a point of reference.Lastly, I really wanted to buy an unbranded phone here from Amazon, but I had to buy from T-mobile because I have read that you cannot utilize the wifi calling feature with unbranded phones. While this is not a HUGE deal for me, it is a feature that while I don't use often, it would be a nice feature to have if I need it. That said, my biggest reason for wanting to buy an unbranded phone is to avoid bloatware, but honestly, this phone isn't too bad in that respect. Not that i have noticed thus far anyway.

"1660","I was very happy at first with my purchase, as this is a very powerful phone.But, seems that there's a growing issue in which areas of the screen die and get unresponsive.In my case it was the Navigation Bar, but other people in forums have this same issue in different areas of the touchscreen too.
            "
"1661","I got this phone from T Mobile two weeks ago.First, many personal settings within the Samsung apps and have been removed.  For example, I prefer my screen to be dark, they've removed this choice, all apps are annoyingly bright white and hurt my eyes.Second, I know the slender body is for easier hold, but they've scrunched the keyboard (I've actually had to come back and edit this review with a real keyboard for all of the grammatical and spelling errors this little tiny keyboard left me with here).  I'm not some old person lacking in dexterity.  It is difficult to swipe and I'm often hitting the wrong key or inadvertently switching screens.Third,  yeah, the camera is just ok.Fourth, I should've qualified for a TV through Samsung getting this phone.  I jumped through a myriad of hoops just for them to deny me on an unstated loophole.To say the least, I disliked the S8 and, I dislike the l this S9 even more.  I'll be trading it in asap.
            "
"1662","The screen is amazing, it takes better pictures than most point and shoot cameras, has amazing battery life, and the performance of the Snapdragon 845 blows almost all the competitors out of the water. The iris/face scanning works very quickly and is effective even through sunglasses for me (as long as they're not mirrored/reflective), and if you do need the fingerprint sensor Samsung finally put it in a natural, convenient location where you finger just kind of lands on it when you pick up or are holding the phone. Also, coming from an iPhone I can say Samsung Pay is by far the best mobile payment solution out there thanks to MST (magnetic secure transmission) which lets it work almost anywhere as it simulates a traditional magnetic card swipe rather than requiring stores to upgrade to NFC payment terminals.There are entire articles that do detailed reviews of phones, so I'll cut that review here as I have no complaints about the phone... possibly other than the Bixby button, but that can be remapped or disabled.
            "
"1663","Wound up settling for an S9 after my first couple choices turned out to not be fully compatible with Ting's network partners. Phone is decently fast (I'm coming from a E4Plus so my standards are probably low). The curved glass is a nuisance. It seems to be impossible to find a screen protector with good reviews. Not happy with the case choices either. Have an otterbox defender right now but it doesn't come with any kind of screen protection thanks to the...curved screen. The edge pull out menu is too fiddly to bother with.Bixby is a fracking nuisance. You have to agree to Bixby sending off your data in order to get to the control panel to sort of turn it off (you can't actually turn it off but you can make it require a double press of the Bixby button before you trigger Clippy 2.0).Android Pie update worked well enough. Took 4 or 5 restarts between the security and galaxy app updates before and after and the 9.0 update itself. I figured it made sense to get the update out of the way since I was coming from 7.0 that way I only have to relearn android once. Apparently you can't change the icon shapes on Samsung's implementation of Pie without installing a new launcher. The new icons look pretty doofy.The Samsung Smart Switch data transfer failed using the supplied dongle and cord from my E4 (the app errored out on the Samsung) but worked fine via WiFi.Fingerprint reader works well, facial recognition much less so.Camera doesn't seem amazing but I haven't really played with it much. There's a pretty intense yellow cast to indoor shots. I haven't done any outdoor shots yet. It's surprisingly easy to get a booger hook in the way taking a photo given how tall this phone is.In my perfect world the phone would be a bit wider and shorter so it'd fit in a pocket better. This phone sticks out just as much as my old phone. I usually carry the phone in my shirt pocket and do a lot of bending and lifting at work so my E4Plus has taken a lot of tumbles (shout out to Supershieldz and Urban Armor for it emerging unscathed). Given how hard it is to protect this thing and how how pricey it is I have some trepidation.

"1664","Quality hardware.  Software took a step back on T-Mobile network.  If you are a T-Mobile customer and travel internationally, think twice before buying the Galaxy S9 or S9+.  You will get a warning about data roaming every 10-15 minutes when you travel outside the U.S.  No way to turn off the warnings.  Only happens with Galaxy S8/S9, not earlier Galaxy models or other brands.  This problem was first reported 9 months ago but has not been fixed as of today (August 23, 2018).  Buyer beware!!!
            "
"1665","Clearly I am not a Samsung fanboy. I purchased an S6 that I was unhappy with. The amount of ""bloatware"" and ""pushed"" software was incredible. The phone's performance was at best lackluster. I traded it in after a few months. Then the S9 came out with much fanfare and reviews that often put ahead of anything else. It's as bad or worse than the S6. Yes performance is way ahead, but the ""bloatware"" and ""pushed"" software is worse than ever.The touch screen seems ultra sensitive at the edge, but try touching in the middle. It's hit or miss, even with the sensitivity set to believe I have a screen protector which I don't. Opening the screen sometimes reveals the home page, sometimes it is some other random thing from an app. Then there's ""butt dials"" that I'm not sure are truly butt dials as I have had more in 3 months than I have had in in total over the last 3 years! While on that subject, I an be walking around with my phone in my pocket and it suddenly starts playing music. The local Verizon store has attempted to resolve many of these issues without success. They have offered to replace the phone, but the one that they sent me was ""refurbished"" and had many scratches on the screen-light but still scratches. I refused it. All this makes me wonder how the reviews could be so positive. Farewell Samsung.
            "
"1666","I recently traded in my iPhone 7 Plus for my new S9 Plus. HUGE mistake. Bixby is the absolute worst voice assistance program I have every used. Understands me about 10% of the time. Works ok with Bixby button, but voice wake up (Hi Bixby) will not work. I've reset, uninstalled app, and uninstalled updates. No luck. Luckily, OK Google works perfectly. I definitely recommend disabling Samsung Voice service from your keyboard settings. Voice transcription is horrible. Google Voice Service seems to work almost flawlessly. Also, I do not care for the camera. Compared to my iPhone, the photos taken in ""Live Zoom"" mode are too oversaturated and blurry. Everything appears to have an orange glare.The keyboard is also terrible. Auto correct never works, auto-capitalization fails to capitalize my ""I's."" I love the screen, the themes, and Especially love Samsung Pay, but I miss my iPhone.

"1667","I received it on April 11 2018 and sadly it was used. As soon as I opened the box, phone was upside down, box was disorganized and headphones & cables misplaced.I needed the phone so much that i stayed with it but if you have another option simply go for another one.

"1668","Samsung makes amazing phones. No doubt. The build is awesome. The software is abysmal. There's so much bloatware and  all you can do is disable it not uninstall it.  This is a common issue but I shelled out 900 dollars for a phone and Samsung has the nerve to tell me what I'm allowed to uninstall from it?! Bixby is terrible. Awful. Trash. And yet I have a button for it that I can't remap. Guess what I can do?disable it. Yup. A dead button is better to Samsung than a button I can use on my almost $1k phone. The update speed is one of the worst of any brand of Android phone manufacturers. I switched carriers so I don't get OTA updates. I was told that Samsung switch would work. So no big deal right? It doesn't. It says my phones are up to date and it's 2 months behind in security patches. My S7 active was on nougat when oreo was out and it said I was up to date. Samsung's solution? Visit a Best buy store every month to get the update. GTFO.  The hardware is awesome. Wonderful camera. Amazing screen. Long lasting battery. But that software is trash. Complete trash.If you read all that and still want it kudos to youIf you have a pixel 2xl and want this I'll trade you lol.
            "
"1669","First let me say that most of the negative reviews I have read about this phone are from people complaining about samsung bloatware, too many notifications, or bixby. The people who are complaining about this dont know how to use the phone. First of all you can disable a lot of bloatware apps and for the ones that you cannot disable, you are able to hide those apps. For notifications, you can disable notifications for any apps that you choose. As for bixby, you can disable the bixby button as well as turn off bixby home if you dont like it. I honestly forgot that bixby was on this phone.Now that I've gotten that out of the way, over all this phone is amazing and truly premium. Touchwiz is fluid and intuitive. The fingerprint sensor has been moved to an ideal location, the speakers sound really cool with Dolby atmos. It's TRUE surround sound especially when you watch a video in landscape mode, the sound is really cool. The intelligent scan has worked great for me but I dont use it that much. I've had this phone for about 2 months now and it's still extremely fast and snappy. The overall interface is beautiful.My only negatives about this phone are in regards to the camera because I wish it had a dual lens rear camera like the s9+. Not sure why samsung didnt make this phone with the dual lenses. The camera is still good, but this would have been cool to have. My other complaint is the camera interface is a little bit odd and takes some getting used to.Overall it's a truly premium phone. Best android experience you can get in my opinion. Samsung packs so many features into their phones and I love it. Some people complain about this but I love exploring these features.
            "
"1670","I got this as a replacement for two S7 Edges that I had to return. I figured it'd make sense to try for a fancy new phone, seeing as it has been many moons since I've had an actual brand new phone. I was deciding between this and the OnePlus 5, but this came with a bunch of free stuff and I have had major issues with getting support for products that aren't sold or supported by my wireless carrier, plus the OnePlus had a couple of weird compatibility issues that I wasn't as much of fan of.Pros and cons here:+ Amazing camera-- performs great in low light, much faster than previous models, and some fun new features.+ Fast processor. Fast fingerprint sensor and many more options for unlocking that I haven't tried yet.+ Much faster startup than S7 Edge.+ Excellent battery life. I can go through the whole day without worrying about running out of power, which is great, because now I have to buy all new freaking USB-C chargers, because capitalism.- Bixby is truly horrendous-- would rather not have anything at all than a built-in personal assistant that is completely useless, doesn't understand basic speech, and can't really do anything. ""Bixby, is there a hardware store around here?"" ""Let me see... do you want to call John Doe?"" Made worse by the fact that Samsung has attempted to needlessly gamify the Bixby concept, so you get experience points when you talk to it.- Samsung tells me that the voice-to-text that they use in the Samsung keyboard is the same as the Bixby voice recognition, which is effectively useless. It misses every other word and mistranslates most words. I had very few issues with my S6, S7, or BlackBerry Q10 before that.- Fingerprint sensor is mildly frustrating on the back but you do get used to it.- Lack of a home key is sometimes unreliable for full-screen applications.- Some issues with unreliable full-screen/split-screen performance within specific software. I've had this issue only with YouTube and Google Maps, but it's frustrating.- Battery, while taking a long time to get to 5%, will die almost immediately as soon as it hits, say, 3 or 4%. I know this is a question of software rather than hardware as far as how they display it, but my S6 and S7 were much more accurate in terms of how much life was actually left. It is the difference between having to run to a charger to ensure that your phone doesn't turn off in the middle of doing something and, well, keeping it on.- Takes FOREVER to charge with the OEM charger-- a couple of hours to a full charge and no quick charging on the factory OEM charger. Sometimes won't charge at all with lower-ampacity chargers, which is an obnoxious design flaw of planned obsolescence slash idiocy.- Some software issues that I didn't have on the S7 and S6 including with Netflix, some radio streaming apps, Facebook, and odds and ends with a couple of other things. I'm used to these things taking several months to get resolved.- I've had some charging issues that no one, including Samsung, Amazon, or T-Mobile, will propose resolving other than to replace my device. This is the third replacement phone I've tried to get for my S6 Edge, whose battery life started to wane to the point of being totally unusable after a couple of years. It's extremely frustrating to deal with this.I will revise my review in another couple of months-- will see how it goes.
            "
"1671","Good features but serious flaws for expensive price.  The GPS never works right.  Using other phones with gps apps work excellent. The Samsung device is useless.  Second phone model where the ridiculous location for a fingerprint reader is in the rear.  Half the time most users will need to pick up the phone to scan a finger.  Often, the camera lenses gets dirty being near the fingerprint reader.  Just plain lack of common sense. Lastly, it lags in performance. My Sony phone of half the price is always much faster than the Samsung.  Samsung is the new Apple is ridiculous pricing for the value.
            "
"1672","This is a fantastic phone.  Awesome screen, and the camera is good enough that you don't need to purchase a separate camera to take pictures.  well thought out and very fast.  We purchased the 256GB version directly from samsung.  It also has a microSD card slot, so you can add another 400GB on top of the 256GB internal.The wireless charging is also great.  it works even when there is a leather case on the phone.  not sure how it works, but it's pretty cool.
            "
"1673","I didn't see the point in spending this much money on a phone, when something a third of the price will make calls, have internet access etc. However, my good camera packed up at this time. After reading how good the camera is on the S9, I hoped to save replacing my good camera, and travel only with the S9.However, the reality is that the photos are still from a limited size camera with a very small lens. I consider the photos to be very good from something this small, however, they can't replace a reasonably good dedicated camera. It can take great shots in the right conditions, and I'm very impressed with the panoramic shots.The ""ok Google"" feature is good. Face recognition works well. I haven't figured out what Bixby is supposed to do. I have wireless charging, which us useful, and will hopefully mean there is no plug damage, and I should get a couple of decades life out of the phone. It's still a nuisance having to charge the phone every couple of days.Note, this is from someone who has never taken a selfie (and probably never will). I use it for internet and data so rarely that I have these normally turned off to preserve battery life.  If I had my choice again, I'd have bought something much cheaper, along with a good travel camera.
            "
"1674","So my review of this phone may be a bit different than others I have never heard of anyone else having the complaints I have with the most recent of the Samsung line up. With that said I will start with what I do like the S9 has the best camera I have ever used that is the single thing keeping me on Samsung currently. I also love everything software wise besides Bixby I always hit it by accident coming from the Lg G6 I am used to volume down being there. But here's my issue with it the screen curve away from the viewer annoys the crap out of me if i prop my phone up with its stand to watch videos the curved part usually gets a glare and it makes the phone far less easy to protect with the screen being way more open to contact on dropping it. I have decided when LG makes a new phone like the G7 maybe I will go back because I really enjoyed the flatter screens and the Lg setup was more appealing (No Bixby) but I will miss this amazing camera if LG slips up in that department.
            "
"1675","Had several generations of S phones.  This 1 seems to be going backwards instead of forwards as far as inovations and features. 2 gens ago did voice recognition texting.  Where did that go.  Screen scratches more easily.  OS updates weekly that are buggy.  Search engine querry randomly locks up phone.  Too many keystrokes to do what i want.  Not intuitive.
            "
"1676","The product came as brand new and arrived just in time for christmas! I've had it for a few weeks now, and it is definitely a stellar phone. I upgraded from the Samsung S4, and I also used an iPhone for a bit and can say I love this phone. Plus the curved edges make wallpapers and photos look nice. For some reason I was having trouble with the Sim ejector tool that came with it but when I went to my local carrier they were able to pop in a sim just fine. I also couldn't disable Bixby for the longest time until literally a few minutes ago, for some reason I never got the cog wheel at the top and the settings for Bixby voice until like I said, a few minutes ago. Honestly just glad that I am finally able to disable it completely, wished I didn't have to wait so soon. Hope to keep this phone in good condition so I can resell it down the road. Plus, I got a one year warranty as prescribed.Note: I bought from Amazon and NOT a third party seller. If you do then it's on you. Also many people leaving reviews didn't even buy from Amazon itself, and it's confusing people as to why there are so many low ratings. My advice is to buy from Amazon and you should be fine.
            "
"1677","I made similar comments about the S8. This phone is a great upgrade from that. Two things stand out for me. One is the improved picture quality at night and the second is the size. I have big hands and I work on screens a lot so my eyes are easily tired. Having a bigger screen helps.This phone feels strong and robust in the hand. It has heft that speaks of its quality. The screen is amazing and I get great battery life that is easily two days if I use it sparingly. Used heavily it easily makes it to the end of a long day.What would I improve? For one a slightly bigger screen. Also make them more affordable. Having to fork out so much money for a phone seems ridiculous. OK its the best phone in the world but still. This costs more than many 60"" LCD TVs. How is that even possible?
            "
"1678","The main issues with the S9 Plus are with camera performance. The rear and front cameras consistently overexpose the shots. This was a problem on the S8 as well. In addition, selfie shots are a bit soft and a little washed out. If you're not picky about photos from a high priced phone, then go for it.Other gripes are the half dozen Samsung apps that cannot be uninstalled and the Bixby button that can't be remapped (typical Samsung)
            "
"1679","Have owned a galaxy s series since the original galaxy s but I think the 9+ will be my last Samsung phone. The android platform was meant to be open and unrestricted so quit forcing me to have apps that I dont want but cant remove. Your Bixby spyware is an unwanted waste of space and resources that cant be disabled,  uninstalled, or removed in any way, and quit limiting the bluetooth max volume further with each update. I am a truck driver and use my phone for work purposes and bluetooth the phone to my truck for GPS and music while driving15 on the volume used to blow me out of the truck, now (3 updates later) 25 on the volume and I can barely hear the music and GPS instructions above the road noise and forget answering a call via a separate bluetoothed headset while going down the road, cant hear it at all over the road noise due to the additional volume limitations that have been added with each update. Another thing, quit with the volume warning every damn time I turn the volume over half, most bluetooth devices have separate volume controls independent of the phone, so ofcourse I turn the phone up all the way then adjust with the volume controls on the bluetooth device, I dont need to be nannied by my phone. As I said earlier, i think this will be my last Samsung phone. If I wanted a proprietary nanny phone I would have bought an iphone...
            "
"1680","The amount of bloatware this phone comes with is unprecedented. Samsung needs to stop with the outdated, unnecessary programs or LET OWNERS DELETE THEM. I feel like I bought a car and the trunk came stuffed with crap I don't want or need, and I can't remove it to put things I want in there. Shame on Samsung. What other industry gets away with this? I don't want to have to hack my own phone to get rid of crap I never asked for!

"1681","This phone is alright, but it is nothing compared to the Finney by SirinLabs.com. The Finney is ultra SECURE, with a built in cold storage wallet for crypto lovers. It has 128 GB of internal storage upgradeable to two terrabytes. The Finney has decent cameras, a great battery, 6GB of ram, and the phone can pay you over $300 back through short videos when you get the phone. More videos will be added in the future, making the phone not a purchase, but a mo ey maker. The Finney runs on the blockchain technology with SECURE calling, messages, internet trafic, and IPS, as well as other security measures. The Finney is also a breeze to use.

"1682","The phone is good but not a great. First the curved screen is annoying if you use the phone without a case because touching these edges by mistake will block the other parts inputs plus the edges are more light reflective than the middle part so watching a movie on the gym or bright place is annoying. The second problem is that, we are in 2018 and I still don't get it why Samsung still hasn't added the "" Screen turns on by notification"" feature yet when 99% of the phones today have this feature. Lastly, the power save on the phone is still bad, If someone is new to Samsung will not know he or she needs to turn off the battery saving mode on some apps such as Gmail and Yahoo mail, or their E-mails will be arrived late.
            "
"1683","How on earth can half of people who have bought this phone here have issues  from phone not powering or losing power quickly to receiving empty boxes? Those giving it five stars one wonders whether its by mare luck they got good phones or they are just part of scheme to fool people to buy useless phones. Now it seems all the phones being sold as being refurbished  had a problem which could not be easily fixed , so the phones are just fixed to be functioning for a short period before they break down.
            "
"1684","It's a good phone overall.... And I love everything about it.... My only issue is that after 2 months, there was a ton of lagging. I've never experienced this much lagging in any of my old Samsung's phones (S3, S6, S7, S8)  but got damn this one does it a lot. I clear my ram often and restart my phone almost every 3 days. IDK if anyone else is experiencing this but I know Samsung has a reputation of phone lagging. Again great phone and there's my only issue.

"1685","I got this phone when it first went on sale. I was surprised at how small the bezels were on the phone and how great the picture was. This phone has a very large pixel per square inch. The speakers are amazing on this phone, one of the best in the market. There is a speaker on the bottom like usual but the speaker where you put your ear up to talk on the phone doubles as a media speaker for everything that is on your phone, not just calls. The battery at first use to last about a day and a half but not it only last about 3/4 of a day. I usually have to charge it after dinner. Overall this phone is very similar to the Galaxy s8 but has a couple improvements that makes it better.

I mean, it is really great and doesn't have that ugly bezel from iPhoneCamera quality is just about the same. You cannot really tell a difference.The battery life is almost the same and the processor speed is just unbelievable!If you're buying it at the current price point, you are actually getting the same/better phone for about 300 dollars cheaper! Well, it's always been the case though, so nothing surprising.

"1687","To access the home screen or menu of your favorites, you have to swipe the edge of the screen.

"1692","Good - It's a good phone, no doubt about it.  Feels sturdy, something about slow motion, NFC, all the fancy features (you can read the other reviews and marketing jazz).Bad - Now here is what gets me - this fancy screen is fragile.  Be aware - the SCREEN IS NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY.  Even with all kinds of screen protectors, drop this phone and you risk the screen cracking.Yes, friends it happens much easier than it should.  We had the same issue with the S8 and the S9.  It was dropped from a reasonable height (between knee and hip - the exact height you will carry and use it at) and both the S8 and S9 shattered.The worst part is that Samsung refuses to cover the screen under their ""warranty.""The local shop they sent us to did fix the 9 for about $100 less than the S8 (total was $235 for the S9 fix).  Also, remember this phone just came out, we've had it less than two months.  The shop said they already had 20+ people in with broken S9 screens.Wish i could go back to non-curved, more durable devices.

This feature alone was worth upgrading as I'm an avid amateur photographer with several nice DSLR cameras, but face it, I take far more photos with my phone simply because it's always with me.Transitioning from the S8 to S9+ took an hour but was smooth as silk.  *Everything* transferred automatically - apps, pics, files, settings - including the kitchen sink. LolI highly recommend - 5 golden stars!

"1694","I absolutely love this new phone. I upgraded from a note 4 to this product.  There is a small learning curve  as my previous phone was so old however the price is $50 cheaper for an unlocked phone then it is to purchase from Verizon locked.  I especially appreciate the adapter that is included so you can connect your old phone to the new phone and transfer all of your data.

"1699","While I have had several Samsung devices in the past - I spent the last few years with several different iPhone options.  In addition to the step price and ear buds priced separately, I am much more of a fan of Amazon apps / products and my feeling was these would adapt better to Android products.  I am so thrilled I took the leap to make this change - and here is a list why:1.  Super high quality phone - with simple set up.2.  AMAZING camera with loads of different features.3.  Dual sim - so enjoy BOTH work and personal number on the same device.4.  DUAL WHATSAPP!!!5.  Seamless integration for all Amazon apps (photos, shopping, music, Kindle, and Audible).  Same was not true ot iPhone products.6.  I have been duped by Apple to some degree - H have invested thousands in TV and movies through iTunes - hoping that one day they make these available on other devices, but happy that purchases through Google or Amazon will be should I move back to Apple in the future.7.  Can't beat the price - was able to trade in an old phone and saved $200!!It is hard to say what the future holds but I am quite happy to be back with Samsung for now!!

"1700","Arrived 2 days earlier than I expected.  When I opened the box, it was brand new, never opened.  Works great and transferred all the files from my S7.  If this is what I can expect when I order, I'll get another for the wife.

"1701","My fiancee's Galaxy 4 wasn't holding a charge anymore so after constant crying we went to Verizon last Sunday to see if they could help.Instead of offering to replace the battery they went into full-out hard-sell the Galaxy 9 Plus.  I was just trying to replace the battery or get a cheap phone, instead they bedazzled her with all the useless features she will never use and I got stuck with a $999.99 phone to pay for in monthly payments over the next two years.After a lot of extensive computations on their tablet, this is in addition to a whopping $12.00 military discount if I give them a copy of my DD214 but that has way too much information than what they need including my social security number.  I passed on the military discount, I think I can afford being cheated another $12.00... I just love all this disingenuine ""we support our military"" BS I hear from people and businesses because its a good marketing gimmick.

I want a 5"" display.

"1703","The AKG earbuds (included in the S9 package) are a nice addition but sounded tinny and low volume to me. I tried changing the earbud tips but didn't get much of a lift.  Then I tried the S9 ""Adapt Sound"" feature. I was amazed how much the sound improved!

"1706","It is impossible to customize your home screen. It comes with this Bixby thing that is a pain. The screen keeps on rotating even after you turn rotation off. It is way too flimsy. The browsers flip over to a another browser when several browsers are open at the same time. What really bugs me is the phone does not record all of the incoming phone calls. So, when you miss a phone call, you have no idea who called.

            "
"1717","Great phone, three stars because I am comparing it to a phone that is less than half the cost with close performance. Look at the ZTE Axon 7 and you will find a lesser camera, but not by much plus stereo speakers and a solid build. I returned it because it is so much more than the ZTE and only offers modest upgrades in comparison. That being said, the phone itself is beautiful and well made with lots of great features, but the price point is the killer based on its mild competition. This is all my opinion for my needs an economic philosophy and I mean no disrespect to Samsung. It's just too much money for what else is out there at this time.
            "
"1718","Okay so I switched from the iphone x to the galaxy s9 plus. And I have to say, I'm glad I did. The size is perfect. It's long enough to multitask. Right now I'm actually watching hulu and I'm typing this. Which on my iphone I couldn't do. And the way it performs is 100% better than my brand new iPhone x. I was pretty skeptical because I would lose everything from my iphone especially imessages. But honestly I dont miss it at all. If you're thinking about switching to android from iphone I think this is the phone you should definitely get. Hands down!

"1719","This is my third Samsung Galaxy after switching from the original iPhone.  This was a huge upgrade from my Galaxy Alpha.  The operating system is way way more polished and the camera is superior to my Panasonic Lumix.  My wife's Galaxy S8 seems just about the same but the 9 is noticeably zippier but I have way fewer apps.  In our household we have Macs, PC's, iPads, Roku's, Tablets so we aren't married to any particular brand.  For the phones I've enjoyed Samsungs.  My wife got a deal on an LG and it was a big headache as it had hardware failures.Important, currently, as of this writing the S9 has a software problem where notifications on the apps DOES NOT work.  Since I've come to rely on those little numbers on the top left corner of my apps this is an inconvenience.  My old Samsung came with SVoice which I prefer over Bixby for simplicity but it's slowly winning me over.  Ask Bixby to Rap for you, it's hilarious.

"1720","Came from a Huawei honor 8. I got this phone as a gift... I was looking to buy a one plus 6t or mate 10 pro when the prices come down... But hey I have an s9+ now... Not my ideal phone but it is good.Right out the box I had to make some adjustments. Deleted a slew of aps or moved them to a folder. Changed the always on display to not, because battery life is a thing I need. Phone case, yeah I got a clear one and a skin, because the downside to a phone like this is everyone has one and I don't want to advertise I have an s9+ for theft reasons. So I got it in purple because black is bi gender and purple is for girls and gays so there is less value in the black market if stolen. Got me a skin and a clear case and a film screen protector, because I don't plan on upgrading till 2020 when you know 98% screen phones will be a thing (like bro I don't need the NSA always looking at me with a front facing camera).So yeah. I mean the camera is awesome. It is literally why you get an s9+. You get an iPhone x if you are an idiot who is allergic to money and wants to blow $5000 on the app store and when your iPhone breaks you don't believe in repairing so you buy a new one, like that is cool dawg.So yeah the nice thing about having the best phone is repair shops can fix it if it gets busted so yeah.I wish this thing had an IR blaster because jacking control over devices is useful. Like my ac etc. But I have an honor 8 to use as an ac remote  when I can't find it... So that is good. I shouldn't eat at restaurant that play CNN fake news anyway, so annoying, one lady kept turning back on the TV when I kept turning it off. Like wtf yo.So I guess I can live without an IR blaster. I am surprised this thing has a headphone jack and is ip 68 rated for water. Kudos. iPhone x is ip 67, losers.

There are more than 3 options asked of you to back up your phone and I learned that they did not work. It's bad when their are app developers making apps to work around problems with the phone's native applications and settings. Never buying another android or Samsug anything ever again.

"1739","I had the S8 and screens were slipping and sliding/opening and closing.  That was resolved either with an update or one of many calls to Verizon (don't recall.) Also lost audio at 2 1/2 years of owning.  My boyfriend shot some compressed air into the audio part and I could hear much better. But I had already ordered the S9 since I didn't think we could fix the audio on the S8.  I'm having so many issues with it.  I was on the phone with Verizon for 6 hours yesterday - different techs. After exhaustive trouble shooting, it was determined that I got a defective phone!  What are the odds?  When I try to google, email or text, I get knocked out into home screen.  Very frustrating to try 8x to complete a 6 line text.  Perhaps it's that the screen is too sensitive. It's not the apps - we put it in Safe Mode.  We changed everything around including Samsung keyboard to Gboard, thinking that was the problem - wasn't. I'm glad that nobody else got a defective phone who has given a review.  Aren't I the lucky one?  I think I'm still lucky in other ways - it's hit and miss whether you get a functioning phone.  New phone arriving tomorrow and will go to Verizon store for set up as I did with this phone.  Wish me luck please!  Thanks.

Popped in sim card and instantly was on AT&T network after a quick reboot. Phone arrived in Samsung package unopened and perfect. I am a verified purchaser and I can compare, because I had a trade-in deal I used to buy my family member another S9 (at the same time) direct from Samsung. Absolutely no difference.

"1744","Please note, it should have been obvious to me but it wasn't - this doesn't rate a full Samsung Warranty, because it technically isn't New. I got it from Amazon Warehouse, and the receipt doesn't include the IMEI. Feh...Still, about 4 months coverage available, more than a refurb unit would come with. Came in the box with some stickers stuck over the other outside stickers. Everything inside the box? Never taken out of the wrappers. Not even a smudge, let alone a scratch. Didn't want a battery that someone else had used already - no problem, no use at all. Perfect in that regard.What a beautiful little phone. Don't see much of the color except when I'm changing cases (story doesn't belong here...), but that blue is very nice. Battery life beats the pants off the Marshmallow S5's best day, I'm sure Oreo (and now Pie) have something to do with that. Even though it isn't the Qualcomm chipset, being USA and all, it still is more than fast enough. Got an unlimited Data Plan with the Sparq company, and zero problem with 4GLte watching March Madness. No lagging on any app, or while switching apps, that I've noticed. No feeling of remorse that I didn't wait and get an S10.Fits my hand, fits my needs, and the price was very nice. I've used Amazon Warehouse before, and was disappointed only once - and they took it right back. No problem this time at all. Used - Like New? For the Win!!

"1759","I used to be a huge fan of Samsung Galaxy phones and have purchased an S4, two S5s, S8 and now S9. Unfortunately, I see Samsung's S9 as one of the most annoying products I have ever owned. The S9 has very poor battery life and never makes it through a day. The camera is disappointing and, of course, the phone comes packed with Samsung's useless bloatware. The worst part of the S9 experience for me is that Samsung forces system updates on users, which cannot be delayed or declined. Each update changes both the look and feel of the phone, and things you have previously configured to your liking. Each update also removes valuable features. The latest 2019 update did the following things: (1) removed the 'disable icon frames' option from Settings meaning every icon now has an ugle white background; (2) disables all Bixby button remapping apps -- Bixby is a very poor voice-based assistant designed to harvest your information and Samsung does not allow users to disable it so it interrupts phone use whenever the side button is accidentally pressed; (3) the Jan 2019 update has also disables Navbar Apps, which performs a function the S9 cannot perform, makign the color of the Navbar at the bottom of the screen match the color of the onscreen app so you now have a hideous white stripe at the bottom of any dark-themed app, (4) the Jan 2019 update has replaced the icon set with an ugly set of cartoonish icons suited to a 6-year old's toy. I could list many more annoyances with the S9 experience, but let me cut to the bottom line: Samsung has no interest in giving customers the product/features they want. Samsung wants to control every aspect of how you use and set up your Android device to make you use their proprietary apps and AI. Instead of providing the features that users want, Samsung disables great apps that provide those very features. Instead of allowing user choice over things like Bixby, Samsung coerces their customers by making it impossible to disable them. Samsung's entire product philosophy is arrogant, high-handed and tone deaf. If it were not for a faster processor and 4G capability, I would rate the S9 as an inferior product to the S5 from some years ago. The S5 had user-replaceable battery (no built-in obsolescence to create new landfills), no stupid curved screen edges, no extremely annoying Bixby, and more user configurability over the features and experience smartphone users want. Samsung is going in exactly the wrong direction and I bitterly regret spending several hundred on an S9. I will never buy another Samsung product.
