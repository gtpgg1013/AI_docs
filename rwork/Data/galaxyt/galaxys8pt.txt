"1","What I like the most about the phone is that it was a unlocked phone but when I had it activated by T-mobile it work fine for a day unlimited data,talk, and texted. The second day I got a notice in notification screen that it needed a Verizon Sim card ,the phone became useless no talk no text. I reboot the phone and notice at start up a Verizon start up screen a peers.  Is the phone locked or unlocked as advertised?

"2","I received a demo phone empty and a different model. These are crooks. It's a fraud.

"3","This is a Samsung phone. It came with AT&T instruction book.The description stated it was a US unlocked phone and it is not.The phone came and the default language was Dutch. Had to use google to translate so I could get it set.The phone will only only use 3g and 2G. 4G is not available.Do not purchase this phone if you are expecting a US version. Amazon should prevent fraudulent vendors like this from selling on their site.

"4","Ordered this device while Harvey was ongoing. There was a slight delay, but that was inevitable due to the inclement weather. Arrived within the time frame and Amazon notified me, as and when there were delays.The device was grouped with the Case and Screen Protector that I had ordered, which was very convenient. Packaging was secure which is expected for this device at such a price range.Overall, the phone is brilliant. Sharp display, clear camera images with AF. It runs all apps like a breeze and is well suited for heavy multitasking. The bezel-less display is a joy to look at and reading on it is very comfortable. It also ships with USB (B to C) and (A to C) adapters, which helps during our transition to USB C type plugs.The battery life is amazing, for a phone with such a sharp and bright display, and also considering the hardware. The 3500mAh battery offers enough juice for an entire day of light usage. Heavy use - like watching movies or playing games like Real Racing, etc. drains it faster, but that is expected from demanding apps.The issue of the fingerprint sensor being too close to the camera is real for the first few days; but after using it as your daily driver, you tend to figure out where it is and it doesn't pose much of a bother, unless you deliberately want to smudge your camera lens.I would highly recommend this device to anyone with a moderately high budget. It looks amazing and performs much better than it looks. I would also recommend to get a protector case (the rear side is a fingerprint magnet and you wouldn't want to crack this amazing display) and a screen protector. To all those having second thoughts, I would say: Go for it!

"5","Very disappointed with this purchase. No US warranty!Since I opened the box, the phone came with vertical marks on both edges. Very light marks but noticeable with the screen off.I passed that issue, but two days ago the screen glass broke on the botton edge without any apparent reason.I took the phone to an authorized shop to change the glass and the attendant told that it is an international  version and don¡¯t have warranty in the US. Really disappointed with this phone.Don¡¯t know how Amazon let this type of products are sold in this site.

"6","If you bought a Samsung S8+, you now have Bixby, a piece of bloatware written by a group of teenagers tasked by Samsung with imitating Google Now, Alexa, Cortana, and Siri. The result is absolutely catastrophic and reminds of Word 1.0 (if you are old enough). The software still does not recognize voice <U+2013> no, it¡¯s not just because of my accent <U+2013> making it perfectly useless.The catch is that this ¡°assistant¡± <U+2013> which would be called Jar Jar Binks if it was from a galaxy far far away <U+2013> is tied to a side button. As soon as the S8 was released, people came up with Google Play applications to remap this button or to disable the software altogether. Samsung retaliated by releasing an update to prevent the hack from working. It lasted for a week until a clever developer found a countermeasure.One million people have downloaded one of the anti-Bixby programs on Google Play. The other Samsung S8 users are probably trying to figure how to do it, I guess. Well done, Samsung! You have released another Galaxy Note 7...So, I will now give you a way to BOTH disable the pathetic Bixby AND remap the button.1. Download ¡°Package Disabler Pro¡±2. Search for the Bixby software in ""Package Disabler Pro"" and disable all EXCEPT Bixby Home and Bixby Voice. They will be rendered harmless without the services except that they detect the button press and raise an event. You can disable the rest of the Samsung bloatware while you¡¯re at it.3. Install the BxAction software from Google Play4. The BxAction software detects the raised event from step 2 and it will be able to start another app.5. Map the button to something useful like Google Now (which is a piece of software that actually does what Samsung advertises Bixby for...)

"7","Do not buy Samsung. Everything I own is Samsung, been buying Samsung for probably 10 years, but no more. This phone stopped charging. I contacted Samsung 1 week before my warranty was up and they said it would be fixed and I would be contacted shortly. 2 weeks went by and I heard nothing, so I called. They said my warranty was up, even though I had contacted them when my warranty was still good. I still have the transcript of my first contact with Samsung proving I was still in warranty during during my first contact. They are now ignoring me and do not want to fix the phone.

"8","This is a really good phone with amazing display. I received the shipment in very good shape (and all the items which are supposed to be there are included). It was very kind of the seller to also provide an converter for the adapter. It has been only 24 hours since I'm using the phone, but still here are my feedback with the limited use:Pros:- Display is simply amazing. This is the best display I've seen in a smart phone till date.- Battery life is decent, given that it's my first day so I'm using it quite a lot, but still able to get decent enough battery life at the end of the day.- Both the facial and iris recognition works very fast, I don't know how secure they are, but for me it works fine if there is some level of security and it opens real quick.- Included earphones are decent enough (not too great).- Always on display mode is really helpful.Cons:- The good old finger print whine. How can designers be so foolish to place it at the worst possible location on the phone. Seems like they were too proud to simply copy the ideal placement from Nexus/Pixel line. I might get used to it, but right now it's a conscious effort each and every-time.- The phone is too slippery in the hand, so it'll be almost impossible to carry it without a  protective case.- Again what were they thinking when they launched Bixby. It's almost pathetic in comparison to Google Assistant. I might end up remapping the Bixby button to GA anyways.- Not a flaw of the mobile, but this particular international version doesn't have a warranty (as is rightly mentioned in the product description), so you can't register the phone on Samsung US website.

"9","Received on time in excellent packing conditions.  FINALLY, I purchased a phone from Amazon that said it was ""new"" and it is!  This is the 3rd one that I had to buy to have that happen.  The other 2 sellers listed their phones as new and when they arrived the seal was broken or totally taken off all together.  The first guy actually put a new sticker that said ""do not accept if seal is broken"" over top of the original ""broken"" sticker.  The second guy just removed the sticker altogether so there wasn't a sticker at all.  I've bought a slew of Samsung phones over the years and I knew what to expect, but if you didn't know, you would probably wouldn't realize the difference.  BUT, having said that, this phone came brand new with the unbroken sticker. It is working perfectly (albeit is only 1 day old now).  The color is quite pretty and I think both men & women will like it.

"10","This product is not US version nor having any US warranty. Also model number mentioned is different than mentioned in phone settings. Amazon should blacklist this type of sellers. (VIPOUTLET). If this is mistake by Amazon, Amazon should be sued for manipulation.

"11","For those of you that are consider buying this phone, let me mention some common variation of this phone:SM-G955F: International version, Samsung Exynos Processor (supposedly use less battery, last longer) , for GSM carriersSM-G955FD: International version, Duel Sim Card, Samsung Exynos Processor (supposedly use less battery, last longer) , for GSM carriersSM-G955U: US version, Snap Dragon Processor (supposedly better graphic support for gaming), I see people said the unlocked version support both GSM and CDMA carriers, but I do not have this version and have not verify this myself.Above are for S8+, S* is similar, part number replaced 955 with 950, with smaller screen and battery power.I used SM-G955FD:for about a month now, this is the most expensive phone I purchased.  Below is my list of pro and con.Pro:Decent Camera, good with low light environment.Great Battery life, 3500 amh, last longer then any other phone I had in the past.Support wireless charging, water-proof.Less overheating.  It gets warm when playing games while charging but never gets to point where it is too hot to hold.Con:Unusual Screen ratio.  Most game app do 16:9 screen ratio, this phone is thinner so when playing games, there are black boarder on both side and make it look smaller compare to other phone with same screen size in the market.  This also make it more difficult to type, I often press wrong key by accident due to spacing.Overall, I think this is a good phone.  Best Buy is offering a lot of promotion on this phone right now so you might wish to shop around before choosing where to buy it.

"13","After my phone started to show it's age (about 5 years old and the battery needed to be constantly charged up during the day). The hunt for a new phone began. After reading a bunch of reviews and going on the various phone forums, I decided to go with the Samsung S8+. I had an iPhone before and hated it, so, that was not an option.I've had the S8+ for a year now and I couldn't be any happier. The unlocked version was a better buy than getting it from my carrier because Samsung sends out updates immediately, while your carrier is a lot slower in rolling out the latest updates. One of the reasons for not getting it from my carrier is the lack of ""Bloatware"" that carriers like to add to their phones. My unlocked phone still has a very good battery life (I can go three days without charging my phone). Under heavy usage, I can go two days between charges.

"14","Verizon could not activate phone because it is not USA version. I took all precautions by purchasing phone case and screen protector. Placed protector and all on phone out of box.

"15","Wifey's an Apple-Head ... I'm Team Samsung ... the debate continues.  She recently upgraded to the iPhone 7 Plus (Red Special Edition) ... & it's 'nice' ... but when I received my new Galaxy S8+, I was instantaneously reminded of the style, quality & excellence that only Samsung can deliver.  It's not even close.* FYI ... I purchased a Verizon Prepaid SIM Card, as a suggested add-on through Amazon after adding the phone to my Cart.  The Verizon SIM Card is a 'Verizon Wireless SIM Kit Prepaid Sim Card - (Moto G & Any Verizon Branded Phone)'.  When I attempted to activate the phone w/ SIM Card through the Verizon Wireless website, the activation would not complete & Verizon claimed I needed a 'Samsung' SIM Car Kit.  However, my wife completed the activation steps that accompanied the SIM Card Kit (the instructions on the packaging), & the activation completed flawlessly.

Make sure to put a cover on it.As mentioned, it is an international model from UAE. Genuine product. I bought from Wireless Place seller and using it in India.Would not go more into pros and cons as you can find them online.

"17","It's a VERY NICE PHONE!!, unfortunately the one I bough after 15-20 days developed a camera failure: ""Warning Camera Fail"". And here is the second problem... WARRANTY IS ONLY VALID IN THE U.S.!!!, Samsung it's not like Apple, Samsung warranty is local on phones so forget it you think Samsung will accept your warranty elsewhere. I went to Samsung Colombia and their preliminary analysis is that they are not sure if the problem is with the camera (70% probability) or the board.  At this time I have not yet decided if sending  the phone to US for warranty or take it to Samsung Colombia at my own expense. If the hardware problem is with the camera, the replacement will cost me like US$100-150.  Because I saved US$350  buying the phone in US,  it still makes a good deal and the camera replacement will give me a year of warranty on phone's camera in Colombia.Beware because this ""Warning Camera Fail"" error its a very commune HARDWARE issue on the S8/S8+ models. I have bough several Samsung phones, they are excellent and will buy Samsung again... I just wasn't lucky with this one.The phone works perfectly well in Colombia (GSM-LTE 4G), it gets the updates on time. I have not taken it to other countries yet.

"18","Update... 6 months later and I'm still loving this phone, no problems at all!!Arrived quickly, great price, and very easy to set up. Wow what a camera, the pictures are amazing! I am in the southeast US and have Cricket wireless, no problems at all. I've only had it for a day but I've always had Galaxy's and never ever had any trouble with them. I hope I'm as happy with it in 6 months as I am right now.Update....I was hesitant but couldn't pass up the price, it doesn't come with a warranty but I've never had any trouble with my past galaxy's so I went for it. I absolutely love this phone, I've had it for a couple of months now and zero problems. I was a little worried because I couldn't find a case and screen protector that worked well together and also looked good, the curved screen is very tricky. I decided to get a case but not use a screen protector, I haven't had to drop test it yet bet the screen is gorilla glass and resists scratches very well, I dont have a single one yet. Love this phone so much that my husband bought the S8 as well.

"19","I ended up going to the hospital and was unable to make the return date of February 3rd.  I have had nothing but PROBLEMS with this phone.  UNLOCKED is  joke!  Voice problems. Problems not properly connecting to my carrier. Glitches in the speaker system etc.  The phone diverts back to a ""prepaid"" credit card phone status and cannot make outgoing or incoming calls.  I've tried different sim cards and hours worth of TECH support to get this phone working.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.  Will try to work with Amazon a little bit more to resolve the issue.

"20","I was sold a Galaxy s8+ that was for AT&T and not unlocked. I was on Chat with Verizon tech support for over three hours trying to add my current account to the phone and we found out it isn't unlocked. So, I had to purchase a code in order to unlock it and I won't get the code for two-four days. Very unhappy. Shouldn't advertise that a phone is unlocked if it actually isn't. The phone is compatible with Verizon but it is just the fact I have to go through this after spending about $450. Other than that the phone is nice and does work great.

"21","This Samsung device receives 9.5 from me.  I have had an issue with almost every apple iPhone, mostly because of their weak cell receptions.  I was always frustrated with call quality and apps crashing.  Also with the last IPhone 6S I had owned the battery would always drain once down to around 25%.  This S8+ does not have any of those problems and is phenomenal in performance.  There is no slowdown switching from apps, video and call quality are top notch.  Color calibration to app resolution, video games to Microsoft apps, whatever you throw at it, it does without difficulty.  Call quality, audio and cell reception quite excellent.  I have T Mobile service and was worrying that the speed would drop from LTE down to 4G or 3.  Not once does it drop from LTE speeds.  I know many people complain about the 16:9 ratio.  This doesn't bother me.  If you want to use pictures for desktop, just adjust the ratio in Camera app.  Almost every app is now fitted for the screen ratio and when streaming videos, you can double tap the screen to zoom to fit.  This feature makes the video streaming very very enjoyable.  The only complain I have is with the AKG ear phones the phone comes with.  Ear buds do not have a good bass.  I ended up using the Samsung ear buds instead.  Factory Unlocked version is definitely worth the price because there are no Carrier bloatware on it.  Yes!  No more Bloatware.

"22","I bought 2 of these and so far they're working great. I had to give a 4 rating because they took about 3 weeks to reach me. Not sure what happened with the shipping. I also had trouble getting 1 of them to set up. It came up as T-Mobile and refused to recognize my Verizon card. It took me hours to get it to work. I had to factory reset and keep restarting the phone over and over before it recognized it as a Verizon card. As far as the phones go they came factory packaged and appeared to be brand new. No complaints there! Make sure to check with your carrier before buying and see if they use GSM or CDMA. Buy the wrong phone and it will not work!

"23","I have had this phone for several months now.This phone has great specs and does not fail in that regard. It also contains many of the features expected of flagship phones such as waterproofing and wireless charging.With that said, I had 3 concerns when initially purchasing this phone after coming from a Nexus 6P.1. Phone updates, including upgrades to new versions of Android.2. Non-stock experience, including many Samsung apps already installed.3. Single bottom firing speaker.With that said, the first issue is still a concern. Updates are slow, especially considering that my previous phone is already on the latest version of Android. This is a huge disappointment and will likely prevent me from purchasing another Samsung phone again.The second issue has been less of a concern for me. Many of the Samsung apps add additional functionality that is not found in stock Android. They are very usable and are worth giving a try.The third issue is still and issue, but some people have been able to enable stereo functionality, but will require rooting the phone. The speaker is loud, but stereo audio sounds much better.

"25","Did not read the customer questions unfortunately... I trusted the product description and saw the model number. I thought this was the G9550 and they just forgot the 0 or something. The product description does not match the item I received. It says snap dragon and that fit with what I thought it was. Instead i got the G955FD which does not have the listed processors. Too many damn models for international versions. It doesn't help either that my phone provider does not support the model I got. Please update your model number to include the actual model....or models you send out so people can know in advance without looking at customer questions. Also change your product description if it's not the actual product description...The good news is Amazon support is the best support out there and have helped me and said they would get me a full refund.

"26","It is a nice phone and works well. I have been using it for about 4 months and have not had any problems with how fast the phone operates or any software glitches that are game breaking. However, I do not use the bixby button and it is annoying since my old phone's unlock button is now where that button is located. Also, when utilizing the phone and accidentally touching the curved edges you get little popups in the corners that are also really annoying. And lastly the curved edges make it extremely hard to protect the phone's screen. This is due to not having a phone case that protects those edges of the phone. I much prefer a flat screen. I did not think this would be a huge deal breaker when I purchased the phone but after dropping it twice, with a case on it, I have received two cracks in the screen. One crack for each drop. I will probably end up replacing the screen and trying to make due with the issue, but I am not happy with samsung over this phone and looking a bit harder in the future at other phone manufacturers.

"27","the S8 Plus is very nice.  The screen is great and the phone is fast, responsive and well designed.  a decent wired headset and fast charger is included.  i am getting good battery life.  my only complaint is the apps that come with the phone and can¡¯t be uninstalled.  this is especially true of the bixby app which i don¡¯t use.  it has a dedicated button which i disabled.  the voice dictation doesn¡¯t work as well as the Google dictation.  fortunately it can be changed to use Google by default.

"29","I was skeptic about buying this because I wasn't sure it would work with my phone plan (Ihave boost mobile). Plus the phone was used and I was worried about what condition it would actually be in once I've gotten it. Once I received the phone it looked brand new not 1 scratch on it. Boost couldn't activate it though so I became a little discouraged. The girl that worked at boost told me I could go to sprint and they would help me for a fee. I went to sprint to get the sims card that boost does not carry on hand. They would have had to order it. So I went to sprint gave them the info on the sim card I needed. They were able to help me and the sims card ended up being free. Setup was easy after that. I just needed to put my info into the phone and less then 5 minutes it was up and running. I love that the phone came with a warranty. I purchased the phone October 2018 and I called samsung to find out how much longer the warranty was good for. They told me August of next year. I do have two cons about my purchase #1 being it doesn't come with a charger and #2 it doesn't come with the fancy headphones that the s8 comes with. Overall I'm please with my purchase.

It looked pretty new!!! I have been using it for a few days now and it works well. Also, I must say i got my metro pcs SIM to work in it and it was like a 123 set up. The signal is good.

"31","I got tired of being forcibly throttled by iOS.  I had an iPhone 7 and like my iPad Air 2 both seem to be running slower and slower regardless of actions taken to remedy.I decided to go back to Android.This S8+ COULD redeem Android for me as prior Android phones were slow, laggy, and poor performers that proved unreliable.  This phone is fast, works smooth with minimal issue and most importantly, is reliable. Unfortunately some of the little, insignificant things have not been resolved but functionality is much higher than with my iPhone 7.Of course, it is still early on, if I have any issues, I will update my review as usual.
            "
"32","I received my phone extremely fast and I have been using it for about three weeks and no problems functionally. My only gripe is that I thought the international versions we're supposed to have 6gb of ram. I might be confusing it with the 128 GB version of the phone however.I have T mobile here in the states and it works brilliantly. Just plug in the SIM card and go. I also appreciate that it comes with dual SIM capabilities if the need presented itself.Another bonus with buying an unlocked phone if you don't get any of that bloatware from the carrier.All in all you cannot beat this phone for the price!PS: I forgot to mention the charger is European, but it does come with an adapter for US outlets.

It was several hundred dollars less than what Verizon wanted.  I charge it every other day now.  The bad:  Well, not that bad.  My Verizon caller ID no longer worked because this is an unlocked version (kind of generic so to speak) Also my Verizon voicemail (visual voicemail) was not available.  Big deal,I found another.  No issues.  I am using the free app Hiya for caller ID and block.  Awesome.

"37","The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is very powerful, very large screen with excellent picture quality.  From a usability standpoint, there simply isn't many better phones out there.  But the curved screen, while unique, leaves a bit to be desired.  When gripping the phone, it's easy to touch things on the sides.  And when apps are not optimized for the curve, some ""buttons"" may be on the curve and difficult to click on (good example is a X for closing an ad.  Might be right on the curve of the glass).  Also, it's difficult to find a good case and that case may not be able to fully protect the phone.  This is because the case cannot fully cover the sides of the phone due to the curved glass.My next phone will not have curved glass.

I tried to contact Samsung's official tech support but even though they help me to go through basic troubleshooting, they told me that international versions of this product are covered directly by the sellers.

"42","Great, great phone.  If I could change one thing it would be the glass backing.  I removed my case because it degrades the quality of photos greatly.  I walked into a cement pylon while walking around sightseeing and it ended up cracking the back glass just below all the important stuff.  Thankfully it all still works but I wasn't running, just walking, and the compression between my leg and the pylon was enough.  About the only issue I have had with it that is Samsung's ""fault"".

"44","I had this phone for about 2 weeks, but I ended up returning it. The camera was really great and took quality photos. I also like the overall design and feel the phone felt very premium. But ultimately I didn't enjoy the Samsung skin over Android, and the software felt jittery compared to my previous phone which was the OnePlus 3. Additionally the placement of the fingerprint sensor was very annoying to me as a left handed person who holds their phone and their left hand of majority of the time. It was just too hard to reach and inconvenient to use.

"45","The phone itself works fine with great colors and reasonably fast. Take excellent pictures and videos and all in all would buy it again. My biggest negative is that for some reason within two weeks of having this phone it crashed and unfortunately I had just taken about 60 pictures that day which never made it to the cloud and I lost them all. Very disappointing.

"46","Loving my S8+. Upgraded from Moto G5 Plus. Loving the big edge to edge display. Battery life is amazing. 15% battery on old phone estimated about 1 1/2 hours left. On the S8+, when I got 15% battery reminder I checked in settings and it estimated about 3 1/2 hours worth of battery left. Thought the S8+ might be too big, but now it feels like the perfect size and I'm glad I went for the bigger screen. Fast charging is awesome. Bought myself a wireless charger for the nightstand and I'm loving that feature, as well. Pictures are great. Phone arrived earlier than expected. Great seller. A+
            "
"47","Having one of the best time with this phone. Camera is really really amazing. Specially the pro mode can outdo IPhones camera in a cake walk. I am really proud of choosing this phone over IPhone 7+. It is a really safe bet.
            "
"48","Im not going to get into huge detail here, but I love this phone.The Camera is amazingThe screen is amazingThe fingerprint scanner works better than everyone says it does.I have taken this phone in the shower with me multiple times. 0 problems.it played music underwater (not recommended) with 0 problems.It does take a little getting used to, but the longer I have it, the more I love it.Honestly I can't think of one thing I don't like.except that I wish the bixby button was programmable.And I would recommend the otterbox Defender series case. Ive had it for weeks and it has been incredible.
            "
"49","I just got my phone yesterday, it arrived in two days.  I thing it should have been backed a little as only was shipped from an Amazon warehouse.  The phone came in a box with very little padding.  I have to say I love my new phone, at it was new not refurbished.  I also had no problems registering it on the Samsung website.  I was a little skeptical in purchasing this at first, there are many negative reviews when it comes to buying a cell phone.  I am glad i bought and I am sure you will too.
            "
"50","Couldn't use it. It was advertised as a GSM/CDMA phone and came as a VERIZON phone. It came in a unsecured, over 4 times it's size box. And right down to opening it, after trying to call Vitalli, my personal ISP, numerous FAQ's on AM, looking for over 6 mon, waited a wk for the po and bothering 2 neighbors to help prevent it from being stolen, I end with this monstrosity.  I even called VERIZON.
            "
"51","Phone works great HOWEVER, I realized I cannot do the video calling to another Verizon customer as I did with my Samsung 7 phone.  It's a Verizon feature that these unlocked phones do not have or come with.  I actually loved the fact that you can be on a regular phone call then switch over to a video call.  Will have to use the WhatsApp video call instead.
            "
"52","I purchased a ""like new "" from Amazon with the Earth Day deal.I plugged in the phone and immediately saw the difference in display from my iPhone 7 and lightning fast response with beautiful curved glass.I was willing to forego a few features such as stereo speakers ,slow motion video and emoji characters to save over$300 compared to the S9 plus.After registration of my product with Samsung , 9 months left on the warranty, so phone was most likely a return because someone ordered the wrong product then sent it back.
            "
"53","I love the phone. But what I don't like is the fact that I spent almost $600 on this phone. And I haven't even had it for 6 months when I discovered it had a crack on the back when I had a case on it the whole time and it wasn't dropped. I figured it was okay because it was just the back. Then today I look and I repeat, my phone has not been dropped, and there's a crack that goes from the power button across the screen going over to the bixby button. I have not dropped this phone so my question is what is going on with the screens to where they are just cracking on their own. That's why this device gets a bad review. Never have I ever experienced anything like this. I had an S7 edge for over a year and not one single crack. This phone cracks left and right without even being dropped. I'm livid, I'm infuriated I could scream that's how pissed I am. It's not cool to make something so expensive when u don't get the quality you pay for! It's laggy, and the screen cracks by itself like it isn't made with gorilla glass. This is pitiful and it makes me scared to buy another Samsung device. Buyers beware.
            "
"54","Sad.  Was looking forward to this phone and and opening, there were 2 piercings on the screen.  Guess buying from AT&T is better?Disappointed.  2nd item I have returned from Amazon in the last 5 years.
            "
"55","So, like many of yall I was a little skeptical about buying a phone online. I've never done it before, however.. I have had it since Monday and it came in perfect condition, there was no scratches, no dings and the software runs perfectly. I just slipped my AT&T sim card into it and here we are. Lol, honestly, everything about this phone is so good, the camera quality is great, the battery lasts me ALL day and I constantly scroll through apps. The screen is big and bright so you can see everything you are reading and I love how thin and easy to hold the phone is. I 100% recommend this phone to anyone!!
            "
"56","What a great phone.  So happy that I left Apple.  Everything is great: camera, wireless charging, face or fingerprint sign-in, the built in speakers, the gorgeous screen, the headphone jack (!!!!)... A very smartly made phone, very reliable and quite a tool when you're out in the world - a powerful computer in your pocket.  Even the free earbuds it came with are pretty good.  It's a new world being a non-Apple customer.Once I got a wireless charger for home and a wireless charger for the office, I appreciated this phone even more!
            "
"57","I got this despite their description stating that it is not compatible with Sprint because people state that it did.  After some time at the Sprint store to get my SIM card I managed to get it working with no problems.  Just have to go to what they refer to as ""corporate"" sprint stores to get the SIM card and make a call and follow through.
            "
"58","This is not the unlocked version as advertised. It will only accept a Verizon SIM. Definitely not what I paid for. Will definitely avoid this seller in future.
            "
"59","4.5/5 for this phone. I am an iphone user making the switch to android. So far i really like the phone. Very easy to use. Definitely love the storage on this phone. Screen is very pleasing to the eyes. Only critque is the finger scanner. Too small and awkwardly placed in my opinion.
            "
"60","I bought this phone used. I was skeptical. I went on seller options and found one that was in good condition. I got a description of the exact phone. The seller indicated that the phone had a few scratches on the back but the  overall condition was good. When I got the phone it appeared brand new, no scratches. It functions excellently.  I've been using it since November and feel like I bought it brand new.
            "
"61","I love the phone but i think i got one with a defect, it randomly freezes and turns off
            "
"62","Overall, I am very satisfied with the phone. The camera is quite good but it doesn't handle low-light as well as I had hoped. The screen is definitely scratch resistant (you can scratch at the screen with your keys and it won't leave a mark). The glass (front and back) are NOT impact resistant and you can expect them to crack the first time the phone falls from your hands and hits a hard floor (I was aware of this issue beforehand, so no complaints here).
            "
"63","better then phones from TracFone the unlocked feature lets you use features locked on tracfones such as fm radio for free no data needed. you can update software versions on android and such it allows you to use it on any type of service  you have slot for sim card and for memory card it as all the Samsung galaxy features you could ask for
            "
"64","The phone stopped working on February. I took it to the assistance in Brazil and I was told that they cannot do anything due to my puchase in the US instead of in Brazil. That is fine however, I'd like to understand why to phone has just stopped connecting to internet. The mobile cannot find any connection at all.I'd like tpo know if you can help me get my phone in good shape. I cannot even restoere factory conditions. The phone doesn't recognize my samsung account. It is really crazy. Please help me. Tell me what to do!! Thanks

"66","I don't usually leave reviews but this phone is stunning. I bought the phone through a third party seller that offered the phone with a bundle of high quality accessories. All for $40 dollars less than the listed Amazon price. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.A warning though like many other reviewers this phone is very delicate put a good case and screen protector on this phone it definitely is not meant to be naked. The water proof design is a life savior as my previous phones had died to h2o, it's nice to know this phone is safe against most situations.
            "
"67","I ordered this phone (New) on the 1st of January and had it delivered to me via 2 days shipping  on the 4th, it came earlier than expected and I was excited with the delivery in the morning instead of evening. I have tried to check on few things about the phone. The screen is a perfect one, the camera till date is awesome, the battery life is good too, the speaker is also good and the overall body shape is awesome as well. The only issue I'm having is that when I'm on call I hardly hear the caller but if I use speaker mode it's loud ofcause. It might not be a general problem because electronics can be funny sometimes. I was contemplating returning it because of the earpiece issue but since it's something I can manage there no point going through the stress of returning it  just for that. Well, it depends on individual differences. Overall, it's a nice phone to use.
            "
"68","So i bought this phone and its been a couple of months and this phone did not come with the original charger it seems its giving everyone  a different charger as for what i see in the pictures the charger they gave me sucks and i am still trying to charge with it and it takes like 4 hours to charge and sometimes it doesnt even work its ridiculous but overall the phone works great i just wished it would of came with the  original charger
            "
"69","Very Happy! Received it today I was so worried that my sim (cricket) wouldnt work because this is international version. Surprise it works perfectly so I will confirm for you all stressing cricket sims work and this phone is amazing!!! Don¡¯t buy refurbished and don¡¯t pay more for us unlocked versions this international works just fine in the us.
            "
"70","Paid 489.99, knowing it had cosmetic damage and used. Came with clear case and charger. Had phone for 2 days. Technology speaking: so far so good. Only two minor obvious scratches and 1 barely noticable (mind you it was to be expected) but both were on the back screen which appears to be easily replaced and I'm the type of person to take the time out to do that.the other is easily covered with a case...no front screen damage, came two days early; seems like a steal for an avg  $800/unlocked phone.
            "
"71","Just got this phone today after waiting days in need of a phone. My excitement was replaced by ANGER when after an hour long conversation with support I am told that I can either send it to Samsung or return for a refund. The refurbished phones are locked & you cannot access them. Amazon knows this & they continue to sell them anyway. Amazon has crossed me for the last time!
            "
"72","It was a huge upgrade from the galaxy note 4The screen is very clear and large.I'm still getting used to the weird way it screenshots but that's a software thing... and well it is mostly okay.It's a fast working machine, the camera quality is amazing. I love taking underwater movies. It does not do underwater pictures well. It's like it doesn't register my fingers touching the screen when there's water all over it. But video is fine.Battery life is fine. I'm on my phone a good amount, not watching movies but listening to music and social media and the battery will last me a day a night and a bit more.
            "
"73","Something wrong with this phone. It came with a lot of malware installed (pop up windows) which I do not know how to get rid of. Moreover, when I tried to register this phone on Samsung by IMEI it told me that it is ""Sprint"" phone and warranty expired a year ago. I tried another way by serial number and got error. That is probably why I can not make software update, it is failing either. Something definitely is not clear with this company.  If you want to by Galaxy S8+ find another place. Believe me you will get a lot of headache.
            "
"74","Phone was defective, would not send photos in texts.  After a lengthy investigation, Samsung tech support identified the hardware as defective, and authorized a return.
            "
"75","the device didnt work with Verizon line.  I ordered this device to use it in USA and when I wanted to transfer the Verizon sim from my old phone to galaxy s8+ it didnt work . I was told from two other companies that this particular imported device has limitations that you cant use it with any sims. please either check with manufacturer to remove such limitations or send me email on how to adjust the specifications to accept other sims . if not I need you send other device which does not have such limitations. when i ordered this device i was still abroad but i made shipping to my address in Chicago not abroad so it should have been clear the device should not have limitations withUSA sims .
            "
"76","This phone has been amazing so far, no issues and the battery last for quite awhile, anywhere from 8 to 12 hours or possibly more based on how often I decide to play games and text on my phone. The camera quality is beautiful and crisp and the option to filter out blue light is defently a plus since I stay on my phone before I go to sleep. I loved my LG G5 but this is my new baby.
            "
"77","The phone was good except for the cell service. It claimed it's unlocked , I installed my Verizon SIM card ,and I had poor service even in spots where I had good service in on my old phone. It wasn't using Verizon cell towers when it should. Took it to a Verizon store and they couldn't fix it. Had to return it.
            "
"78","I am extremely satisfied with this phone. Had no issues activating it with my current Verizon account. Just went to the retailer for a free SIM card and they set everything up. One thing that I wished I had known prior to purchasing this was that with an unlocked phone you will  not have voicemail notifications. This is software that is installed by carriers onto the carrier specific phones. The only way you will know if you have voicemail is to call your mailbox. There are some apps available to download so this really isn't an issue. I just wish I had known about this so I wouldnt have missed some messages.
            "
"79","Fast efficient and takes awesome pictures.Only drawback is that the fingerprint sensor is beside the camera which might take some time getting used to and looks odd.Awesome infinity displayVery thin and practically no bezelsDisplay : 9/10Audio : 8/10Speed : 8/10Camera : 9/10
            "
"80","Google removed ""Message tone"" from its Contacts app in the O/S that ships w/ this phone. This is a deal breaker! Each and every text message now has the same damn notification sound. The only work around is supposed to be to download an updated version of the Samsung Messages app to set custom notifications per conversation thread. Of course, going into the app to select update shows it has the latest version of the app which doesn't include  this half-baked work around.Suggestions to switch to a 3rd party app that supports per contact notifications is  unacceptable. It's ridiculous to propose an option that will cause me to lose my 10,000+ text message history.
            "
"81","Excellent phone, works well with AT&T.This is irrelevant to the phone, but anyone that does not have a nano-SIM needs to pay $5 to AT&T to GET A SIM WITH THE SAME NUMBER
            "
"82","The phone itself is so good i loved it but unfortunately i got a used scratched one.DO NOT buy from MOBILES INTERNATIONAL
            "
"83","Of course since my old Samsung was an S5, it took a bit of learning. The phone it's self works great. While I hesitated because it was a refurb, it works as promised. Very pleased with it. Just wish I could have plugged it into my head and understood all it did. :)
            "
"84","so far so good  the only thing iv noticed that seems to not be the best is the battery life, but honestly upgrading from the phone I got last year to replace a broken one, it's so so so much better. I'm very pleased, I was so scared to buy it off Amazon, over all a great phone
            "
"85","3rd month with phone and its progressivly gotten worse. Phone does not come with all features of normal s8 plus such as wifi calling, as well as some camera features. It also drops random calls, as well as won't let people call you randomly. Spend your money elsewhere
            "
"86","The phone is amazing but Samsung is still forcing Bixby on it's customers. If you don't know what Bixby is, it's a personal assistant created by Satan himself. It is the most infuriating piece of garbage ever and you have to jump threw a ton of hoops to suppress it in your phone, you can't actually remove it.While the phone itself is amazing i would consider a pixel XL. Hell, after dealing with Bixby i wish i bought one !
            "
"87","I've used cheap phones for the past several years but recently started my own business and find that I really use my phone enough for work to justify the higher expense so this review is from the perspective of someone who has been using the lower end Motorola phones for a while (most recently moto g4 play).Samsung has features and forces you to have apps you don't want, which I had forgotten about since the last time I had a Galaxy (probably first generation). The first thing I did is remove the auto updates on all of the apps I didn't want or need in the first place. Too bad I can't remove them.Ring tone defaults are weird and that's the second thing to fix. You also will have to set everything up so you are able to get your MMS messages since the phone comes unlocked, but I expected that.The screen is beautiful. Once I have it in a case, it's much larger than I expected, which is a good and bad thing. Sound quality has been good so far, but I typically talk through a Bluetooth (either headset or car speakers).One thing I did not realize is that this phone does not charge with the standard micro USB. It is not as inconvenient as I first thought because the adapters are readily available and cheap, so I'm just ordering several of them. I'll also give the wireless charger a try.I do think I'll learn to love this phone in time once I get used to all of the Samsung quirks again.Pros: Great picture, and easy to read/work on documents for work. Once it's organized and personalized, the layout makes sense like any android.Cons: different charger, stays lit all of the time (draining battery) to show the clock (although there might be a setting I haven't found to fix that).
            "
"88","Received exactly what I expected. More than half a year in, the phone still presents difficulties. I had some problems with my network (Tmobile USA) and had to go in and get something reset. Had difficulties with apps not functioning and sometimes bluetooth wouldn't work. Not too sure whether these problems were attributable to the phone or my network (although I've since gotten the S9Plus and gave the S8Plus to my dad, I've had no problems), it had some other minor limitations.
            "
"89","The S8+ is new and box seal unbroken. ExpertTechs did it right!I have Root access or Administrator access to the phone, it also receives system updates from Google.After three system updates the phone is using Android Pie.  :-)
            "
"90","the phone worked fine for about a month, but then got stuck in a boot loop. It stopped working completely less than a week out of the return window. Samsung support has done nothing and say to call a number that never picks up after 3+ hours. I am in no way happy, this is god awful service on a broken product.
            "
"91","I've purchased now 3 phones from this seller and all 3 have arrived on time, in perfect condition. Shipping was fast and convenient. Phone was as described and works wonderfully. I've have has any problems with any of my phones. Will buy from again in the near future when they offer the Galaxy 10!!
            "
"92","Awesome phone.  One of my biggest purchasing criteria is camera performance, and the S8+ doesn't disappoint.  Wireless charging and many other great features make this a keeper.  It also got the 16 year old's positive vote, so it must be good...
            "
"93","Phone is fine. Works like a charm. But when you go and register the product, the warranty is already expired (By at least a year or a few months). We ordered a replacement model and the issue remains the same. Don't order.
            "
"94","No problem with the phone, everythin was ok, i have been using it for 6 months and no problem
            "
"95","I am going to try another phone and see if the model number is correct. The model number of phone I got ended in FD. Beware if ordering a used phone. You may have to try a few to get one.

"96","So far, so good.  Opened the box, put it the sim card from my old phone and was up and running in minutes.  Nice phone.  Beautiful display.

"99","the planned obsolescence of my s5 finally got to me so I bought the s8+ works good - wonder how long they will allow me to use it before they slow it down.
            "
"100","Apparently Samsung changed the menus, on the open network unlocked phones like this one, and eliminated wireless calling and video calling from the menus.  This is a problem that many people are having with this phone but Samsung refuses to provide a patch to fix the problem. Reviews talk about the phone being capable of wireless calling but for some reason Samsung changed the menu for this open network phone.  You have to download third party apps like Freetone and Skype to use these features.  Other than that the phone works well.

"105","The Galaxy S8+ is sleek, lightwieght, and very fast.  Upgrading from an older Galaxy, this phone is just amazing.  It has all the perks and features needed in 2019, wireless charging, fast wifi, NFC, water resistance, and many more.  The one thing that is annoying is having big fingers and using the fingerprint reader, it only captures so much and I have trouble unlocking the sometimes.  As for the battery life, my phone lasts all day and is at 50% before I charge going to bed.  Previous Galaxy I had to charge 2 times before night.

"111","It came in very good conidition and works just like new! Worked perfectly with AT&T and it has flawless performance. If you just want an S8+ and don't care about a scratch on the glass back or a nick here and there, then you will absolutely love this. Nothing a case or skin can't fix anyways. Make sure to get this from 97% positive and up sellers though, don't take risks when buying products like these.

"112","Took 2 weeks to receive. Then the phone was defective. Not happy at all. Hopefully the exchange or refund will work out better. We shall see....
            "
"113","Pros: This phone is not completely outdated as of yet and is still extremely functional and affordable. I had been an iPhone user for many years but their idea of trying to get people to upgrade by killing off the battery and making apps not work because a phone is 2 years old is ridiculous. I refuse to pay $1000 for a phone.Cons: This is simply my opinion but it really has nothing to do with the phone itself. Getting used to working an Android OS again.Alongside with Amazon payment plan, you cannot go wrong with this phone.

            "
"117","I don't normally write reviews but I must say this was an extremely disappointing product. The seller clearly advertised this BRAND NEW phone as having a USA warranty and could be used in the US. The phone was bought internationally, making it unusable and not covered under Samsung warranty. Very unhappy and extremely annoyed at being lied to. Product was also not sealed as the ""sealing"" sticker used for the product box was missing as if the phone was switched from the correct device.

I don't know if its because it not a Verizon phone which is who I have as a carrier or what ? Also I had to go to a Verizon store to activate they will say it wont work for Verizon but if you keep on them or find a tech sales person who is willing to try an not just say no they can push it threw or whatever they do just takes a little doing on there part but it will work on Verizon
            "

"159","I bought a Samsung Galaxy S8 + 64GB Unlocked Phone - 6.2 ""Screen - International Version, but when installing a different SIM Card it is not compatible with any network even though it is an unlocked phone with International version
            "
"160","So, the makers of this phone decided to add a personal assistant that pops up whenever you click a button on the side. I have everything integrated with Google and have no need for another personal assistant nor any desire to test one out. But, I constantly accidentally hit this button, and this thing that I have no desire/need for constantly pops up, usually right when you're in the middle of something.""But why don't you just disable it?"" you might say. Well, they make you sign up for an account and go through a whole process just to get to the screen where you can disable the button. So, after a month of aggravation, I finally decided to go through the hassle of disabling this stupid thing that I have not desire nor need for. Well, ok, I finally get it disabled, but having to give it my personal information and such, and who know what kind of data it's gathering. Not to mention power it uses, data it uses, and taking up a whole screen constantly to the left of the main screen. So, I decide to disable the app entire. Well, there's like 4 apps it uses, and you have to disable all of them. But, surprise, Samsung deliberately makes it impossible to disable.So, this all seems like a grand ploy to force you to use their personal assistant, and they figure that you've already bought the phone and won't go through the hassle of returning it, accustoming yourself with another phone, etc.. But take it from me, save yourself. Get a different phone now.
            "
"161","I cant really say i dislike anything about it i like thag yoh get the fast charging with the intetnational charger for free makes charging super fast. If j have to say one dislike its the screen protectors at the top of the phone it doesnt glue on so well and then you have lint and other dust under your screen protector

"164","Battery life is abysmal, even in power saver mode . Phone is difficult to hold. Fingerprint scanner is at best, so sometimey it is frustrating. You would think that after 2 years that Samsung would have had a fix for these problems...

"245","Really wanted to give this phone 5 stars. I bought the international version and received it a couple days ago however, when I plugged in my headphones they do not work.

            "
"247","This phone is not unlocked!
            "
"248","First off, from a hardware viewpoint this is an amazing handset. Stunning screen, sleek lines, all the sensors you would ever need, and some of the richest blacks I have seen from an AMOLED screen. Then ... Samsung goes and mucks the whole thing up with gobs of horrendous software that they lock down and won't let you disable. I literally JUST wanted to change my wallpaper image and the software refused to let me do it unless I updated to a new Samsung Themes market where they try and sell you themes. I just want to change the wallpaper for pete's sake!And the Bixby key? So many people don't want your Bixby key, plus Bixby makes it impossible to use google assistant from the lock screen. So Samsung adds the option to disable the Bixby key ... ONLY if you jump through all the hoops, creating a Samsung account, and letting them into every aspect of your phone. Nonsense. Just another data mining exercise. Then there is the Oreo update. I pay a premium for an Unlocked, from Samsung, handset ... then Verizon and T-mobile handsets get the update first. Really Samsung?? You're so far behind that the telcoms are beating you on major OS updates? A 200.00 Xaomi MI is a recognized Android One phone and gets the newest stuff immediately, but my 700.00 Samsung is months late? Seriously? If that is the case, then offer me a 50.00 USD plan to nix the special software nonsense and give me a stock Android experience. No Bixby, no 300 Samsung apps that I'll never use, and no locking my phone down to what YOU want me to do in an effort to mine my software.This will honestly be my last Samsung phone ... if I wanted a locked down experience I'd buy an iPhone. There is a very good reason why companies like Oneplus, Xaomi and Essential are getting a chunk of the market share, they are giving the customer what they want. A quality handset that isn't hobbled by software and apps they don't want and can't disable.At this point, I plan to see what the Oreo experience brings (if they ever get the freaking thing released) and unless they give us some control over the Bixby button and the option to use Google Assistant like it was designed, I'll sell this junk and buy a Oneplus 6. At least then I won't be controlled by a company, being told what I can and cannot do on a device that I bought and paid for. Frankly, there should be a law that Unlocked phones cannot contain software that isn't able to be disabled. I bought it, it's mine, don't tell me how to use it.
            "

"323","Awesome phone
            "
"324","I upgraded from a galaxy mega 2 to the galaxy S8 plus. And this phone is amazing. Amazon got it here in less than 48 hours and the price was right! Thanks Amazon
            "
"325","I purchased the Samsung S8+ from this seller. Item arrived new in box and carrier unlocked (using with Cricket Wireless)  just as described. Love the phone!
            "
"326","No words , one of the best smart phone,  I recommend this than the iPhone s8s
            "
"327","I have this Galaxy S8+ working under the Cricket carrier.The fingerprint scanner on the back is a non-issue.  It took me no time to become accustomed to it.  Using it is even easier after putting a case on the phone.The S8+ is noticeably better than the S7 and can handle anything you throw at it.  It is a beast at multi-tasking.  If only apps were as well designed as this phone, it's annoying when they crash or freeze because of imperfections in their coding.  If you have problems with apps glitching or crashing, it's the app, not this powerful phone that can stand toe-to-toe with desktop computers.UPDATE July 4, 2017:I no longer have this phone, it went defective on me.Exactly a month after buying it, the screen blacked out while I was laying on the couch watching a Twitter video. Everything was responsive, the screen just wouldn't light up. I ended up returning it just in time. Now I have the Galaxy S7 again. If you get this expensive phone, you should get some type of insurance on it.  This expensive phone taught me that no phone is safe from defects. This one comes with a one-year warranty, but I don't know how thorough it is. When you get the phone, you have a certain amount of time to sign up with Samsung Premium Care. I think Amazon has an insurance package too so you should compare both of them before choosing either of them.Now that I'm back on the Galaxy S7, I'm reminded of how this phone is a still a beast too.
            "

"523","First of all, lets be clear: I received this cell phone day expected (sheers Amazon) but... Just seven days after start using it stoped to work! It felt in water (no more than half of meter and less than 2 seconds) and its death even when its advertised as IP68 -water resistant-. I bought it when travelling in US and now I am back in my country with an absolute regret about choosing Samsung... My worst decision... Thansk God I still have my HTC M10, and as expected still working in my hand (contrary to the ""superstar"" S8+)... Very dissapointed with $400 less in my wallet. I have to admit that those 7 days that it worked I was really amazed with this cell...

"528","I have owned the galaxy S2,S3, and S6(flat Display). With all of those phones I was happy from purchase, to replacement (usually fleeting battery life). I have just purchased two(one for me and my significant other) of the Galaxy S8+ phones, and am somewhat disappointed. I was reluctant to purchase at first because of the edge screen being forced upon me, but I could no longer deal with old phones. Here are some of the things I have noticed.Cons1. Screen glare - when in lit areas I seem to always have a glare on one side of the edge. Even in Samsung's display pictures there are glares on both sides of the screen. (hard to be unseen once noticed)2. Screen protectors - I have tried 3 so far none seem to like to stick to the screen well and two interfere with cases I've tried.3. Cases - Not a problem yet, but all the cases I have tried seem leave something to be desired in protection. A lot of the front of the phone seems uncovered.(very nerve racking, mostly due to curved screen)4. Finger print scanner - WHY OH WHY IS IT ON THE BACK? Next to the camera non the less. Unlocking with single hand can be a little tedious. Because hand placement for use, and unlocking it are different. Kind of have to slide it around your had to do one or other. Thick cases can make it hard to get proper finger placement.5. On screen buttons - I have had phones with them before, HTC M8. After about a year the phone slows a touch, and they seem to take a couple seconds to appear. May be an no issue with this in the future.Pros - (most other flagships are equal here)1. Battery - Very good battery life. After a day of moderate use its still over 40% remaining.2. Speed - A very fast phone, little to no lag launching apps.3. OS - I do like the Samsung version of android over some of the other companies. Probably because I've had so many of their devices.4. Camera - Very fast and great pictures. video recording is very high quality too.In conclusion, I would recommend looking at other options if you are on the fence about the infinity(edge) display.  I took a chance and do slightly regret it. I am currently stuck with the phone for most likely the next few months.Only way I'll buy a Samsung again is if,1. I can get a flat display again2. Take the buttons off the screen.3. Bring fingerprint scanner back to front.
            "
"529","Received this phone 3 days ago, and finally got the SIM card from VZN.  Apparently, this phone has an issue with NOT being able to send sms texts.  Spent 2 hours in the Verizon store trying to get it sorted out.  2 factory resets, and 2 additional SIM cards - still will not send SMS texts.Besides the no texting problem, the other issues I found in the short time I had this phone is:-The new 'Bixby' feature is a huge disappointment.  Extra side button which is easily hit by holding the phone.Fingerprint reader is in an awkward position on the back of the camera.  Unable to use thumb print unless turning phone around.So, if you're just looking for an expensive phone without the ability to respond to texts, or constantly pulling up Samsung's attempt at AI whenever you pick up the phone - then this one is a winner.  If you're looking to actually use all of your phone's capabilities - then I suggest going elsewhere.I've been with Samsung since the Galaxy S1 days, and this is by far, the WORST phone I have ever encountered (and I even had the Note 7 for a short time).  Returning this POS.

"533","I only had this phone for 1 week; then i started seeing white vertical lines, then it blanked out(obviously it was defective), called samsung and they were of no help, they told me i had to buy a screen replacement which was half the price of the phone. i felt very disappointed, sent it back to amazon and thank God, got a refund. Because of the customer service i received from samsung am switching to apple and buying an iphone. i have aways been a samsung user but after that experience i am making the switch.

"538","the best phone I ever had.
            "
"539","I love it.  It's a decent step up from my previous Galaxy (S6 Edge Plus).  The placement of the fingerprint scanner is my only gripe (next to the camera lens... really?) but the awesome retina scanner makes up for it.  I've read some say the retina scanner ""takes too long"", but mine unlocks consistently in under a second.This is a deceptively tough phone, but you'll want a case as it's pretty darn sleek.
            "
"540","Very satisfied about this phone

"541","For some reason even after I do the initial setup on this phone, webpages will default to Chinese for a moment and websites that use location won't be able to verify my location. All of my settings are set to the US, GPS is always on and I still have these issues. I feel since Amazon lets a lot of knockoffs in their store that this could be one of them. Still preforms decent, aside from that, but very skeptical.

"552","Wow, I was quite disappointed with this much anticipated phone.  I don't like the aspect ratio. Would prefer to have a wider screen. Phone is very long. Plus, the Samsung user interface is much changed from previous generations. Don't like it as well. Back side if very slick and shiny. Really shows the finger prints.
            "
"553","This is my first ever written review, I was so dissatisfied I was compelled to write. I feel completely scammed and mislead by mention of the Warranty. I went to register my S8+ product with Samsung and was rejected. I attempted to register  using the S/N then IMEI. REJECTED BOTH. I would have been much more satisfied with a Chinese phone for a much cheaper price with ZERO Warranty. I purchased this phone ONLY for the promise of some form of warranty. WRONG. NOTHING. Where does one go now?
            "
"554","Screen is very nice, and it is fast. The message app is bad, Bixby is bad. why is it that after you type your screen un lock code you must press ok. I had to take it to a Samsung service center to completely flash the software so my conversations would not magically go into mute mode.
            "
"555","All in all, the phone was as described, brand new and works like a dream. I bought it for my sister (who is insufferably picky about any little hiccup) but no complaints from her as yet so I'll take it as a good sign. All in all, was quite pleased with the experience.

"557","At first this phone was great! But over time the Mic started failing. At first I fix it with cleaning out the mic but it failed again and again. The basic function of a phone is to make calls. So why Samsung is my phone not making calls. That why i wanted a phone in the first place. Also google ""Samsung galaxy s8+ ok google cant hear me"" and u will see tons of people in the same problem.... this is so stupid

"563","I bought it to be sent abroad through a relative who was visiting. Phone charged but was losing battery charge in less than one day with NO activity whatsoever!!!! Adjusted some setting, such as turning off the clock when not in use and brightness, but it did not help much. It was still losing power and needed to be recharged at the end of the day without being used at all. I did not have time to send back and request a new one (or maybe just a refund). I am not sure who to blame, but if I could, I would have returned the item and gone to a local store after the experience. A new item should not be functioning like that. I have talked to people who owns the same phone and they said it was strange it was losing power that fast!
            "
"564","This is really a great phone, there's not 1 thing I don't like!
            "
"565","To be honest, I purchased this phone June 5th and have had nothing but problems with it since I bought it. The biggest problem, the battery and charging problems. Every time I let the phone get to 40% or less battery life, and plug it in, it automatically just shuts down completely. Not sleep, not screen off, SHUT DOWN. It has been crazy annoying but i dealt with it since it is the ""best phone out there"".Next, the always on screen. Sometimes it is literally ALWAYS ON. screen is on, at the main home screen, not the lock screen. Anyone can get into the phone, browse away and make calls if I a not watching. Also, in this state, if it isn't charging and I put it in my pocket, it actually heats my leg uncomfortably. The only solution is to hit the power button to put it to the lock screen. Very frustrating but I dealt with it because it is ""the best phone out there"".Now this morning i awoke to find the phone powered off. I assume the battery had dies so I plugged it in. Normally, as soon as it is plugged in you would see a circle with a lightning bolt inside that appears, letting you know it is at zero percent but it is charging. The LED light would also blink at the top....nothing. No LED light, no circle with lightning bolt, nothing. I then proceeded to spend 3 hours looking on the internet, calling Samsung, everything to try and rectify the issue. It just will not turn on.So now I get on the phone with Samsung and they have me go through 20 minutes of attempts to resolve the issue, the same things I just spent 3 hours trying. Still nothing. I also read in their warranty for cell phones (see attached screenshot) that ""During the applicable warranty period, provided the Product is returned in accordance with the terms of this Standard Limited Warranty, Samsung will repair or replace the Product, at Samsung¡¯s sole option, without charge."" So i figured they would just ask the woman to overnight a replacement of this 5 month old phone and I would ship this broken one back, done....nope. The woman on the phone refused to even acknowledge replacing was an option even though I read her word for word what the warranty stated. The only option was to send it to them, wait for them to fix it, and then send it back. All of which will take 2 weeks! I replacement can be shipped in 2 days!. I asked her nicely again to replace it as I cannot be without a phone for 2 weeks, no; she wouldn't even consider it since she didn't believe it was in the warranty in the first place. After a 3rd try to get her to understand she simply got quiet as she refused to even discuss it with me any longer. Very disrespectful and lack of understanding of my situation or their warranty apparently  but also very disrespectful to a customer who has spent a fortune on Samsung products.So now I am sending the phone back to Samsung to let them spend 2 weeks to repair and send it back. In the interim I plan to buy another phone THAT WILL NOT BE SAMSUNG. I have been a Samsung fan for 4 years now and have spent close to $20,000 on phones, TVs, all new kitchen appliances. To be so mistreated after all of this loyalty is unbelievable. After tolerating all of nuisances with this phone and then to be told they cannot replace it but it must be sent in for repair for 2 weeks is just unacceptable. This is the reason why Samsung has peaked for me and will now be going downhill. As far I am concerned there will never be another Samsung product in my home and I will actively tell whoever will listen to stay away from this company who does not respect their customers loyalty.Unless this company makes this right I will get the phone back ,sell it and never even consider another Samsung product, period. The aggravation alone is worth 10 of these phones that cost Samsung less than 300 dollars to manufacturer. Losing a 20k customer is going to hurt. Further I plan to post this review anywhere I can so that as many people considering Samsung products understand the company and lack of customer focus.

"569","At my house Version is the only carrier I had any luck with signal strength. A must have so you don't drop calls or text. I never had any problems with my Samsung  S4. When I got this new S8+  I really liked this phone . I hated paying that much for a phone but I keep them a long time . The huge problem I'm having with the S8+is the reception sucks. One to two bars if I'm lucky and it constantly drops calls and fails to send text. I really like this phone so bit the bullet and purchased a cell phone extender antenna for version . Another $130 added and a real pain to install. After all this it's not better if anything it's worse.  IS THIS PHONE WORTH IT ? Srue .....That is if you don't mind running out in the middle of the street when it's snowingjust to make a call. Yes I'm being sarcastic and yes this phone is a joke!

"573","Everything works properly so far! I literally just got it in my hands about and hour ago. The only reason why I got this version was because, ""International Versions"" run Samsung's homemade chipset the ""Exynos 8895, which is definitely better than Qualcoms ""Snapdragon 835"" chipset. Another reason why this lead me into getting this version, is because I work at Best Buy Mobile and I seem to see a fare amount customers come in with problems with their S8's which are the US versions.

"574","When you spend almost $700. for a phone  you should be able to expect to get what you ordered.  Phone was not received unlocked.

Next time I'll go to the AT&T store and pay more but I'll get what I pay for.  As soon as I return this phone that's where I'm going and get me a phone.  What a waste of time.

"641","the phone itself is perfectly designed, works incredibly well. the only problem is it need you to have a total amount of calling time using an American simcard before you could use the simcard from your own country. this can't be find easily from the description page for this ""international version"" ""unlocked"" phone. it will be really annoying if you don't travel to US a lot or have colleagues/friends from US.

"642","I have been using Samsung phones for 10 yrs.They have made advancements with the S8+, which I truly enjoy however there are too many draw backs for me.The bixby feature is awesome, it took a while to really get use out of bixby for me. You really have to use it in order for it to learn and be useful. I recommend setting it up and going through the prompts, play with it for an hour or two. Set up short cuts. I found that ""take me home"" phrase I used when asking the previous assistant Galaxy to navigate home, does not work on bixby unless you set up a short cut. I do not however like the button. I find myself accidentally hitting the button all the time which disrupts what I'm doing on my phone because then you must wait for the bixby home page to load before you may close out.Two major complaints:The battery. I was blown away by the battery life when I first got my S8+! I've read a lot about battery preservation so I do not charge my phone while I'm sleeping because leaving it on the charger when it's fully charged kills the battery longevity. So I charge a couple hours a day while I'm at work and that's it. I stream music in the car so I expected that to drain the battery quickly but it did not! After exactly 6 months of use, my phone now loses about 30/40% just sitting idle while I don't use it in just about 3 hours. When I noticed this draining battery issue I immediately took action. I deleted every app that I don't use on a weekly basis. I set up the power saving mode. I changed screen settings. It has helped a little bit but not enough to really make a difference. I now have to charge my phone constantly.Because of the very iPhone-esk style they took begining with the S7, the phone now has a glass back that is not removable. Making the purchase of a new battery to fix said problem impossible. I've always liked samsungs products..but this was a poor decision for their consumers.The screen. While the screen is beautiful and ""unboxed""...it is 10x more fragile than any other Samsung or Galaxy I have owned. I cracked my screen within two weeks of ourchase. I was and still am, unable to find a tempered glass screen protector with a fully adhesive screen (because of the new design with the edge). I have sworn by tempered glass screen protectors in the past, they have saved me so many times. I was also unable to find one for the S7 as well. I did purchase one that only adhered on the edges, which did exactly what I thought it would.  It slid off the couch onto carpet and the screen popped right off the phone. Which for the record does nothing to absorb shock and prevent damage. I have the OtterBox symmetry case on my phone and it still cracked when dropped. Right on the stupid edge of the screen where it curves. Then a few months later, it slides off a shelf in the restroom and lands on tile flooring. Shatters again. I have shattered 3 out of the 4 corners on my screen all while in a case. I'd hate to see what happens when it's not in a case.Overall I am disappointed with this new screen, while it is beautiful and excellent for my photography hobby...it just isn't durable or practical. While the new technology advancements Android has made are excellent, I absolutely hate the quality of the phone. It's literally an $800 glass box around a computer.

"646","Don't get me wrong, the functionality of this phone is incredible. However, the phone might as well come with a broken screen. This is the first phone that I have ever broken. And within 3 months of owning it, I have broken the screen twice. Both times were low impact falls from heights of about 2 feet while sitting. Furthermore, it breaks through a case, which is even more baffling.The phone is absolutely beautiful out of the box but once it inevitably breaks, you're left with an item that you just paid $400 - $800 feeling like you're trying to wait out a contract until your next upgrade is available. It would be nice to just fix the screen that Samsung should honestly feel ashamed about but that costs $150 - $200 unless you do it yourself. And then you are right back at square one with a new fragile screen not suitable for a device that is considered ""mobile.""I plan on coughing up the deductible to file an insurance claim on the phone. Mostly because the second break occurred in a way that a shard of glass is now impressing the screen preventing me from escaping a black screen while on a phone call. It otherwise works but I cannot look at texts/internet or even hang-up while taking a call.I would strongly advise against buying this phone. Even though I enjoyed my 3 months of use, I wish I had not bought it. Its pretty disappointing that Samsung is not remedying the fagility of this phone in mass. It's comical that a purchaser needs to constantly worry about a $200 bill while using this phone in a fairly standard way. The iPhone X is also a frightening phone since it looks like the same design. I would be exceedingly hesitant to buy anything that even remotely resembles this design in the future.

"653","The features are alright, but nothing amazing. The Bixby button is just in the way and almost wholly useless. No screen protectors will stay on the damn thing and my screen was broken within 3 weeks because my kid leaned on the sofa and it slid onto my floor. My carpeted floor. This was a phone in an Otterbox case with a screen protector on (I believe it was the 3rd I'd purchased in just as many weeks since they don't stay on.). I took it in since I paid for insurance and they wanted to charge me my firstborn to give me a refurb phone. I decided to call around and it's about $500 for a replacement screen.I'm not particularly hard on phones and always keep them in a case and with a protector because I don't like having to replace overpriced gadgets. The only time I've had a cracked screen in all my years of phone ownership was when the entire strap broke on my bag and my Note 4 wound up with a cracked corner from like 3 tons of books falling on it on a subway platform. If I had any idea that the entire screen would be spider veined from sliding off the front of my sofa onto carpet, there's NO way I'd have bought this. I'm not a fan of the curved edges at all and wish they had a flat version because I really do like Samsung products for the most part. This one, however, is just a dud. It's way too fragile (and repairs WAY too expensive) to be useful to everyday folks. I've gone back to my old phone for now because I can't afford to pay to have it fixed in a repair shop and even the $200 deductible on the insurance policy just isn't worth it for a device that will likely break again if falling 2 ft onto carpet is enough to send it to the ER.

"664","Are you on ios and wondering how difficult jumping ship to the android flagship phones would be?  Well, that is exactly what I did and here is my experience.I'm starting with my Conclusion because this is long: I love the hardware aspect of the Galaxy S8+ with very few exceptions. It's a beautiful phone. After a couple of weeks I have my phone useable with fairly similar apps and functions I used on iPhone. I like quite a bit of the additional functionality and customization offered. However, using the phone is like having every developer trying to turn the phone into a personal billboard trying to sell me something unless I'm willing to shell out $2 to $3 per app in most cases. To gain some of the higher end customization without ads can cost $5 or more in many cases.  It is quite a bit less efficient in every day use due to lack of streamlined integration between apps and additional ads.ABOUT MEI have pretty much used ios for all my smartphone and tablet needs for about 8 years (or whenever iPhone 3gs came out - I'm 99% sure it was before 2010).  I tested an android tablet for about 5 years ago and I was not impressed with the weight of the device nor the android apps so I stayed with ios.  I'm pretty sure after that experience is when I purchased my first iPad.  About a month ago I had a water incident with my iphone 6 plus and had to decide what phone to upgrade to.My motivation is because there are so many exciting phones in the near future, the Samsung reviews are extremely positive, and the Samsung S8+ is so much cheaper than the iphone 7+ after just months of being on the market (and I don't think this trend will change anytime soon). I jumped ship from ios so I could make a better decision about the next iPhone before its release (iPhone 8+ or whatever they name it).  I've used the Samsung Galaxy Plus phone exclusively for about 3 weeks. Here is what I struggled with, my suggestions for non-android users, what I've learned about android ecosystem, the pros and cons post switching, and what I will likely choose next.PHONE DESIGNBig Pro - This phone design makes people drool. It looks great and it feel great in the hand - especially when you compare the plus size versions.  I could have gone with the plain size of this phone and been absolutely happy. My eyesight isn't that great so the larger screen is great.Pro - The size of the phone is great in the hand.  The smaller one is even better. It feels better than iPhone Plus in the pocket, however the height is about the same so short pockets still cause issues.Pro - Build quality seems top of the line. Buttons work great, etc.Pro - I like the color options better than other phones out there.Meh - Expected to be a fingerprint magnet - and it is. LOLCon - The hard to reach finger scanner on back - I type the unlock code OFTEN due to placement.Con - Dedicated Bixby button - this button is just in the way; its placement causes accidental Bixby engagement all the time and Samsung has locked users out of reassigning the button.PERFORMANCE/BATTERYPro/Meh - In terms of speed the OS (Android Nougat I believe) on this device has come quite a long way. Overall I found the OS response almost on par with ios.  I understand the difference between open architecture and Apple's closed architecture, so this is a great achievement but it doesn't outperform ios in my use so I can't mark it as a clear Pro. It felt capable in every way. It didn't glitch in a way that I didn't find acceptable but ios still wins here.Pro - The ability to change performance modes is nice for increasing battery life or performance. I don't play any high performance games, but the gaming folder options to set the phone as a priority for gaming (no interruptions and high performance) may be the reason for some users to choose this over iPhone.Pro - Quick charging and wireless charging are nice to have available (although I dont have those set up in my house).Meh - With the customization of this phone, it is easy to affect battery life without realizing it. In real day to day useage, I don't have all my charging stations set up for this phones usb c connector - I have iPhone chargers set up in many rooms of my house out of necessity. With most of the usb chargers I have, I dont feel this phone charges much faster than my iPhone. In my experience so far the phone underestimates how long it will take to get to a full charge by quite a bit maybe 20 or 30 percent. The good part is that I don't think it will be any worse than using my iPhone - but I'm not charging this thing any less either.DURABILITYBig Pro - Waterproof. Since my last phone died due water and I was always putting my phone in a ziplock bag to run when weather was questionable or out at the lake, this is something I am glad to have.Meh - Screen glass is marketed to be pretty scratchproof. I've ordered a screen protector and I tried to keep the film on the glass while waiting for it to arrive, but the film didnt stay adhered but 4 days or so.  I've been careful and only carry the phone in my pocket by itself and I have a scratch. I've never scratched a phones screen this quickly but there are so many factors that I won't list it as a con.Meh - I cant speak to back durability personally since I was able to find protector quickly and have not dropped the phone. But videos online show that the back can crack if dropped on concrete from only 3 feet which is about waist height. Although other drop tests show it surviving drops from 5 feet, most crack the backglass at this height. Drop tests online seem to indicate decent front durability often surviving a 5 foot drop. From what I've researched, the front seems as durable as (if not a bit more than) an iPhone and the back really dictates a cover.SCREENPro - The screen resolution is great. I do like the screen, but in use at mid arms length away I can't tell much difference with the resolution at max or the mid setting. I appreciate the ability to run mine at the mid setting to save battery life.Big Pro - I stream movies on my phone often and getting a larger video with a more narrow phone is a GREAT experience.Pro - The curved glass is just sexy on electronics. The screens edge does a great job of ignoring touches when holding the phone. That edge is visible when the phone is face down so it can be set for notifications and I've seen the ability to run a stock ticker down it.Pro - Always on display with very little battery impact. I didn't realize how often I turn on my phone just to see the time or even date. Once this is set to disply the things you are 'just checking,' you will save some battery life.Con - The screen seems VERY dim in comparison to iPhone. It is capable of a comfortable brightness, but when maxed out I feel like I'm using a reduced setting from my iPhone.CAMERAPro - That damn camera bump is gone!!! This phone will sit flat on the table - nuff said if you are using an iPhone.Pro - The cameras (hardware) on this phone are best in class.  I give this phone the edge because in low light, it captures more light than any Apple phone.  In bright light, it's a draw unless you truly have need of the 2 cameras on the iphone.  In my use, my cropped images come out great so a 2nd lens doesn't add the same value as low light performance.  My video needs are the same - I need more low light performance than ability to use a different lens.MEH - I'm not labeling this a con on purpose.  I know there is a phone out there with 2 backfacing lenses. 2 lenses do not make me want that bump on the back of my phone.STORAGEPro - You get a respectable 64 Gig onboard and can add a card (whenever you need it) to increase it at a reasonable price using standard 3rd party memory cards.  None of that bulls**t Apple gouging.PORTS/BLUETOOTHPro - Its accessories are all generic. It is so nice to buy an extra cable for $2. I know I can buy 3rd party apple cables but some fit well and some are so tight you may damage the phone. I LOVE not having to deal with that - although switching all my phone docks and cables did cost a few bucks. If the next iPhone switches its port, I wouldn't be able to use them anyway.Pro - The earphone jack. I am no audiophile and have gone wireless for audio in most ways. But by design, my car connects phones to the radio with an audio cable. This phone requires nothing new to use that. Its an added plus when I forget to charge my wireless headphones.Con - The usb c connection just doesn't feel as tight to me.  When I connect the cable it doesnt align straight as easily as the lightning connector - even with using the cables provided with phone. Also, I get errors from different chargers that the phone is not connected completely. I think the error is because the phone is expecting a fast charger, but it has me a little concerned about reliability in the back of my mind.AUTHENTICATION/SECURITYPro - Eyescanner is great for unlocking phone. I've had better restults than many reviews. Mine will usually scan me correctly from a reading position if I pull the phone up toward my face about 2 feet. Even in dim light it usually reads which greatly reduces this next con.Con - I am sooo used to the fingerscanner, it is an unatural action to unlock ANYTHING on this phone. The placement is not where I can reach it naturally so I have to shift the phone to scan and it has gotten to be a real pain in the ass when I unlock apps.Con - Eyescanner either does not work to unlock apps (like paypal, etc) or it isn't coded in a way to easily connect it. It seem to only unlock phone.Con - Did I mention logging into apps is a pain in the ass on this phone? Dashlane is an app that makes this a bit more bearable but once you know how easy it is on Apple it is hardly comparable replacment. If you use financial apps, you will dedicate some time to trying to get around this. I think on the standard phone the fingerprint scanner felt more accessible so this may be an issue specific to the plus model.Meh - Facescanner is available but a photo can unlock the phone. As easily hacked as this is, I don't see the point of using this. Maybe if I wanted to lock a younger child out of my phone. Anyone over the age of 8 that wants to get into your phone will get past this lock.Meh - I generally don't feel as secure with my data in the apps, OS, and features of this phone and the android infrastructure. Many find this a pro since you can choose all these different apps to help. It is the same feeling when I use my windows computer, security is all on my shoulders and I better address it someway. And all the free solutions have ads. Apple has a great track record with securing data, privacy, etc. Everything I read about setting up android points you to security features to enable. Am I protected? I've installed some suggested apps, but who the hell knows.CUSTOMIZATIONPro - Out of the box, this phone is one of the most highly customizable phones available to change your experience to how you want the phone to look and behave. You can add and remove features of the OS (like the app drawer which iphone users do not have), edit how app icon looks, rename or remove app names, etc. Some customizations are pretty sweet - like backgrounds can move with movement of the phone and the camera can be used to sync the background with whatever colors the camera is capturing.Pro - The keyboard can be reduced in size and offset to the side of your prominent hand so that the keys are easy to reach with one hand. If the Big Con for word prediction didnt exist, this might be a reason to change phones when using plus size.Meh - Speech of OS. It is good but Apple does relistic speech better.Con (if new to android) - It is overwhelming to use this phone out of the box without some grounding first. It may be licensing or userbase expectation, but there are dual applications for many functions. It is preinstalled with Samsungs version of chat, email, and browser apps as well as the Android standard equivilent. As you set these up and start using them, they'll be prompting back and forth to change defaults. Some are similarly named and the functions between each have nothing dictating where the app settings will be located, how to engage the settings, etc. The OS does not have any wizard guiding you through steps in an order that makes sense. Apple sort of walks you through step by step of creating your Apple account first, then security choices, etc. You get none of that here. You keep tinkering with creating accounts and settings until something works, then you move onto the next thing you want to work. It may take a week to get this phone to replace an iPhone completely if you use many apps at all.Big Con - Using the keyboard drives me close to insanity because of how often the wrong word appears. It is functional (I've defaulted to using Gboard after some comparing of 3rd party) but it takes about twice the effort as iPhone. If I hadn't used iPhone I likely wouldn't notice but I have used one and I notice this fault - every time I have to type an email or text message.Con - I have some loss in trust in settings to take and work as expected. I've had this phone ring at work when I thought I had do not disturb set. I do not know why the setting changed and it was easy enough to address, but you must click and look for check marks, okays, enable, save buttons that iPhone never requires you to click.  There is no standard across the platform so unless you exit and go back into a setting, I never know it took.Big Con (for my use) - Enabling handicap features can be painful. On iPhone, I can set my phone up to triple tap to enable text to speech so the OS will read aloud to me. I use this very often to have kindle books read to me without having to rely on audible or paying for whispersync books. Enabling this on android is very difficult and it will not continue to read past a paragraph max. If someone has figured this out, please respond with comment.Big Big Big Con - Ads, ads, everywhere. Do you like having your phone boot into a screen with a big ad displayed in the middle of it? Well android provides that functionality - in fact every developer over uses it in a way iPhone users do not experience. Once you customize and get some crazy ad resulting, you'll need an app to find what is causing it. In fact, I almost returned this phone on day 2 because of an ad. And I got some good advice I'm passing along to you if you keep reading.FUNCTIONSPro - Best 3d experience available on a phone. For under $10 you can get a 3d headset for your phone and be immersed in some pretty awsome videos. Yes, iPhone does this too, but Samsung does it better. What I did not know is that the experience is 360 degrees. You'll need to stand up to turn around and see what is behind you, but when you are flying in that jet, you can see the pilot if you turn around. I watched a cartoon with aliens in front of me and rabbit hiding behind me and I missed half of the action because I kept trying to check what the rabbit was doing. This is not something I need to have in anyway, but it is fun and costs very little to get set up. Be forewarned, you will be seasick after your first use and riding a rollercoaster standing up in 3d can make you fall down.Pro - Audio over wireless just sounds better to me compared to iPhone 6. I don't know about other versions but with same headsets I get more bass, etc.Meh - Phone calls are okay but I'm not impressed with the app. It is harder to use and integration between apps is not all that great. Here are some of the items harder than iPhone - answering a call, finding and calling a contact, setting up a 3way call, adding a new call into a current call (still haven't gotten it to happen), selecting a phone number in another app and having phone app open and call.Meh - Bixby is Samsungs response to Siri (and Google Assistant which is on this phone also).  In concept Bixby should develop into something more useful than Siri for chaining commands together (set this setting and opne this app, or open this app and do this), but it is not fully realized yet. Having to hold the button for the duration of the command comes difficult to me and it feels unnecessary and I just don't like it. And I don't like that button anyway. Engaging google assistant is the same as Siri and I like that way of turning it on better. I've used Siri more so I know what to expect and I know what it does. I have less favorable results with both of these but Bixby was only recently enabled. I think it may develop into something pretty nice to use if Samsung will rethink that button and the requirement to hold it for the duration of the command. And honestly about half the time I've clicked on the Bixby button, I was trying to hold my phone or adjust my volume - bad placment.Con - One better like clicking okay and yes to use these apps. Android suffers from the same thing Windows does. You have to click an extra time or 2 to get a function to set. Even when logging in right now, I may have to push the home button, then swipe up, enter a code, and then click an ok to proceed. On my iphone, I pushed the home button and let my finger rest there and I was in. The majority of system settings and apps have similar unneccessary extra selections and swipes.Con - Speech to text in voice assistants, text message or email is truly unpredictable. I did not truly appreciate how well Apple does this until I stopped using it on this phone. It is really that bad in most real life situations that I want to use it.Big Con - There is an emergency call button (it will dial 911 if you click it) that is badly placed on the unlock screen. I conciously have to avoid hitting that stupid thing 20 to 40 times a day. It's these things that seriously puts iPhone ahead of Samsung in actual usage.  I don't have issue with it there, but I need option to move it up on screen where I won't accidentally hit it. I CANNOT BE THE ONLY PERSON THAT HATES THIS.Big Con - Audio volume is ok for music apps but it has an annoying warning about excessive volumes damaging hearing that I want to disable forever and it won't let me. I wouldn't mind seeing the warning and have it go away in a couple of seconds, but you must interact with the warning manually. It is especially irritating because of this next big con.Con - Audio in apps are extremely low when using cabled headsets and at least some on wireless. One example is podcast apps. I have to max out the phone volume and increase my car stereo volume to hear them at the same volume of songs. I use a jabra headset when driving in my car - it's what I used to use with my iPhone and the same issue is present with it. I don't know how many apps are affected, and it may be setting related, but it is an issue out of the box.Con - Videos do not go full screen by flipping screen sideways. In almost every instance iPhone does this by default. It is not the case here - ofen it takes a click or 2 to get that to take.APPSPro - Multiple app stores to download products.Pro - Because android allows more access to hardware and OS, there are apps for a whole different use than what Apple apps provide. There are many apps to add functionality to the phone. The phone can go into silent mode or reduce its volume anytime you arrive at work for example. You can change your icons from developer default to marbles with the app name listed on them.Meh - Apps are mostly as functional as what IOS equivilent provides, but they aren't streamlined for ease of use. I miss my iPhone apps quite a bit.Con - Most underground app stores likely have viruses in part of their offered apps.Con - Most free apps have ads.Big Con - Unless you are willing to download apps from 'risky' locations, apps without ads are double or triple the price on Apple. I rarely see any paid for app include an ad but I see many paid for apps include apps after purchase.UNTESTEDNA - Provided headphones. They are marketed to be $100 street value but I use wireless audio and haven't had the need to test yet.And here are my suggestions for those not used to Android:Don't do as I did. As soon as I got basics down (before I sorted out what I needed to work), I hit the store and got lost in downloading free apps. Before I knew it I had a bunch of apps I didn't remember the function for and I included a launcher that sounded soooo great.  And then I figured out what came with those downloads - apps. I was UNHAPPY for a day with an app on my home screen. It was from the launcher by the way. The launcher made me about half crazy trying to work against it. So, if you are stuck in this mode, uninstall, uninstall, uninstall. Airpush Detector is an app that can help identify sources of ads.Stay with Samsung's default touchwiz launcher at first.  A launcher gives you a look and feel to the device and determines what functions you can add and remove from the settings.  When new to android, touchwiz gives plenty to play with and see what is available and you don't get embedded ads up front.Put the settings app somewhere you can find it easily.By default, the touchwiz launcher gives you a main landing screen that has a google search field and the primary row of phone related apps you see on every screen and one seconadary row of icons that belongs to this landing screen only. When you scroll to the right, the primary row will go with the view and the secondary will go offscreen with the rest of that landing screen. The idea is that the apps on the secondary row are your most frequently used apps along with the main phone apps on the primary row. When you scroll to the screen to the right, that screen is similar to what iPhone screens look like - a grid for placing apps over a chosen background. Each time you scroll to the right you can add one of these grid screens as iPhone does. Something not found on iPhone is an app drawer. It is available from each screen, if you swipe upward on the primary row - there is an up arrow on the primary row indicating the app drawer and you can choose to keep or remove a dedicated button that opens it as well. That drawer has a default copy of every app installed on the phone. If you want one on any of the main screens, press and hold an app inside the app drawer and it will let you pull it upward out of the drawer and it will drop to whatever location you release it at. The copy will remain in the drawer unless you explicitely delete or hide it from there.If you already know you don't like the app drawer concept, you can remove it and the upward screen swipe function will go away and all installed apps will drop onto the those grid screens - just like how iPhone behaves. If you are getting lost looking for apps, go ahead and remove the app drawer now to get closer to the iPhone default setup: Settings app icon > Display > Home screen > Home screen layout.  I suggest adding it back at a later date to see if you like it later; once there isn't so much to get used to at once.You likely are used to having a set of apps on the main row of your homescreen from whatever smart phone you come from. Change the row of apps on the primary row to match what you currently use and set those apps up for use.The timeout to black out the screen is way too fast when one is trying to figure out how to configure the phone. Go to settings and change setting not to lock if looking at screen.  Bixby can help find - just hold the button and ask to change that setting. If you have no Samsung account, you get to set up your account now.The phone is likely completely unlocked to anyone - you should set up security at some point - I suggest setting the passcode, the fingerprint scanner & the iris scanner. You'll be unlocking the phone once you do this, so decide if you want to do this now or later.The phone comes with 2 app stores installed, they are Samsung Market and Google Playstore.  I do not group my apps by developer. I group them by what they do. I suggest you pull the apps out of any folders they are in and put the near each other.  I usually look in the Samsung Marker first to see if there is a version of an app developed specifically for this phone and if not, I look in Google Playstore which will be developed for android phones in general.Next get some sort of security on the phone. Most carriers will have some sort of security app pre-installed. Launch it and make sure it is set up. I also installed Avast from one of the app store due to its popularity across android forums.If you are like me, you now have lots of apps running in the background. Press the dedicated recent softkey next to the home button. It is indicated by 2 arrows making a box. You can close them all.Initially, I was getting confused by apps provided to do same thing. Select an app for each function and remove the other app.Messaging clients: I hid Messages (it wont uninstall) & stayed with message+ until I could navigate the OS easily.Browsers: This is a difficult choice. Samsung Internet(purple globe) is designed to be integrated with this phones hardware and shows to be most similar to iPhone's browser for efficiency.  In my usage, it blocked sites that Chrome didn't and that I didn't feel were unsafe.  If you have no preference and gmail isn't your default form of communicating, I'd disable Chrome (no uninstall available) unless you have same issue I had. If you are tied to gmail, I'd use Chrome and hide/uninstall Internet if it'll let you.If you were using an iPhone before, Samsung has provided an app called Smart Switch to hook to your iPhone with provided hardware in the box (the one with the usb hookup adapter) and it will scan your iPhone and set up your contacts, move your photos if you have room, and find matching apps from the stores.  I'd run that at this time.Now go find a free background or theme you like in one of the stores.Select what displays on your always on display.Set up your apps and you should be set to use the phone for a bit.Once you are comfortable using all that you have set up - maybe a day or 2, set up the edge app. You'll have a better idea by that time what might be nice to have on that shortcut.Other Suggestions:Set do not disturb on a schedule (in the settings app) if you get woken up by text messages and such at night.Block blue light with sunset (in the settings app) - supposedly reduces affects of phone screen on your sleep.Set finger scanner to swipe down to pull notifications open - honestly I dont use it, but go ahead - it's kind of cool.Note:You cannot delete apps that are sitting on the primary apps bar - you must relocate it to the grid. Depending on app, it may not allow uninstall, but you may be able to disable and/or hide.  Worst case, make a folder and hide all unused apps in it.After a few days, research what a widget is and set one up on one of your screens - Maybe a calendar or a clock.After a few more days, research what ""edge"" apps are available to you.Some apps that I'm using:Ad source finder- air push detector (suggested by coworker)Downloaded & changed keyboard to GBoard (suggested by forums and tested well against others I tried)Ad blocker - Crystal Ad blocker (can't remember why I chose this)Pw manager - Dashlane shows up top in many reviews (you have to engage the app to set up the pw)Browser - Puffin pro (free has ads) for speed of use - but it has a drawback of memory consumption compared to other browsersChat client - Textra (mainly testing from high reviews)Widget - I'm using a widget called Month to put a calendar on one of my grid screens.

"666","The phone we received was a counterfeit. If you have doubts if it is a fake, do some research. When I researched, I found things to try and confirm if it is a true Samsung phone or a knockoff. I did some things like, tap on the back a see if it is plastic or glass and look at the size of the bevel of the phone. Buyer beware!

"672","Overall the Galaxy S8 is an excellent smartphone that competes and often one ups other current flagship phones (Google Pixel, iPhone).  Ultimately a few odd design decisions keep this from achieving a full 5 star review from me.PROS-The best looking screen on any mass market phone ever produced-Excellent camera performance-Lighter version of Touchwiz (Samsung OS) including the ability to disable and uninstall bloatware-Not too big to hold (a bit long though)-Solid battery performanceCONS-Odd positioning of a dedicated button for ""Bixby"" Samsung's assistant software.  This button is far too close to the volume down button and I hit it constantly by accident.  Worse yet, it can't be disabled without downloading a third party app.  Even worse, Bixby itself is not anywhere near as useful as Google assistant.  Samsung...PLEASE stop messing with software.  Leave Google alone, this is their core business competency and your incessant layering on of useless features (now coming with a dedicated button) is obscene.  This design flaw will ultimately drive me to a Google Pixel upon their next release (most likely Fall 2017).-Odd positioning of the fingerprint sensor.  Way too far up on the phone which makes it hard to reach, right next to the camera lens.  Bad design.-Fragile glass.  I dropped it from between knee and waist height one time and the glass cracked.  If you buy, you must invest in a screen protector.Ultimately if you can deal with the annoyances listed above you should have no reservations buying this phone.  The screen itself is worth the investment.  Every time I show someone a photo on my camera they comment on how good it looks.  Here's to hoping Samsung scratches the Bixby button, embeds the finger print reader in the screen, and offers a pure Android version.  That to me would be the perfect phone.

"673","Package arrived today with the s8+ BOX and all (charger etc) BUT NO PHONE. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. Payed this much for just a box! THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING OR END UP HAVING A BAD TIME. Hoping for a replacement or at least a refund because I purchased a phone NOT JUST A BOX.
            "
"674","BUY A CASE!!! If you read the bad reviews they all hate the phone because they said it is slippery and fragile!! My only advise is to buy a $20 case and the protection plan! Totally worth it! I bought mine a month ago and it is the best piece of technology I have ever owned. I am a HUGE Samsung fan and this is by far my favorite and has not disappointed me yet. This phone is amazing. It definitely beats out its Apple competitors and if you do not believe me then do your research because this phone is unprecedented. I LOVE it and it is worth every last penny! It will last for years to come and it is built to resist shatters and drops and it is even water resistant for up to 30 minutes under 5 feet of water!!! It is smooth to the touch and is extremely fast!! The memory usage is fantastic and the features it comes with are great. I recommend this to anyone buying a new phone...it is everything seen in the commercials and more. It has Bixby on it and she can do ANYTHING... I often use her feature to remind me where I parked or turn the lights off!!! Amazing technology and great phone!!!
            "
"675","This looks like a great phone at first. After only a few weeks, I realized that I made a huge mistake to give Samsung a third chance (after owning a washer/dryer that died after only 4 years and a TV that came apart and had to be exchanged for a Sony TV after less than a week).First, Samsung's bloatware really ruins the experience. However, with sweat, blood, and tears you can remove most of it. You can even disable Bixby and turn your Galaxy S8+ into the first phone with a non-functional hardware button. However, you cannot have hands-free Google Assistant, even though Samsung advertises this feature.Second, the hardware is fragile. I had my phone in a Samsung case since day one and it still managed to get a deep long scratch on the back. I didn't drop it. It was never outside the case. It was not a third-party case. I'm not a savage. For example, I've never scratched any of my previous iPhones in the span of nearly a decade.Third, don't bother paying for or seeking support. You'll first talk to support that turns out to be volunteers, yet it is made to look like official Samsung support. Then you're given a phone number to call support and ten minutes into the call they mention Premium Support. You then respond with... ""Wait, your not Premium Support"" and they give you yet another number to call. So, you call Premium Support, which costs $288 for 2 years by the way, and are told that you have to pay the $99 deductible even in this case. I then learn that I'm actually talking to someone from Assurant who has zero flexibility. They tell me that they can connect me with Premium Support though. After several minutes I learn that there actually is no other Premium Support entity and that you're really just dealing with an inflexible insurance and that Samsung doesn't stand behind their products.I understand that there are a deductible and fine print but Samsung should also understand that I only do business with companies that stand behind the quality of their products. I didn't drop the phone or use it without a case. I used it with a Samsung case that ended up causing a scratch on the supposedly ultrastrong glass back. If it weren't for Apple's lackluster iPhone releases in the past 3 years I would've never given them a third chance. There will absolutely not be a fourth chance.You'll see this phone on Craigslist very soon and I'll be returning all my Samsung accessories over the weekend.
            "
"676","Actually loved the phone but ""hate"" Samsung customer support.Before you buy, do a quick search for ""Samsung Galaxy 8 USB Port Moisture Detected"".  You'll find hundreds of listings.The closest my Samsung had ever been to water was sitting in the kitchen (and beyond that, supposedly the phone is water resistant).The USB Port Moisture Detected warning pops up continuously and prevents the phone from being charged via the USB port UNLESS you turn it off, turn it back on, insert the plug when then Samsung name comes on.  Samsung referred me to an authorized center who told me that it's a known problem with the software and that it'll be fixed in an upcoming release.  So for the past month, I've been dealing with the constant issue.Enough .......... got rid of it through the Amazon trade in plan and ""upgraded"" to a new Nokia 6.1.Never another Samsung product .for me ...... ever.

"677","Didn't work for me. I took this phone to too different Metro PCS locations and they both said the same thing, no signal and activation won't go through.

"678","If you like the typical intuitive operation of Samsung, you'll get that with the s8+. However, this has so much built-in flexibility, that it might take a while of use to tweak the setup to how you like it. (IFound Bixby invasive and disabled it.)While I bought a battery case for use with it, I have since replaced it with a clear, flexible case and glass screen protector to better appreciate the lighter, thinner features of the s8+ design. And the battery life is great so far (8 months)! For motorcycle road trips, an auxiliary car cord or battery pack work just fine.After having the Samsung 4 (with two batteries and auxillary charger) and s6Edge with a Mophie battery pack, I was looking forward to the s8+.Unfortunately, I started that experience with XFINITY Mobile. But now after switching back to Verizon, it works delightfully!Do NOT use XFINITY MOBILE (my experience)! This review is for the same phone, switched back to Verizon, and that's another horror story!!!

"679","Long time iPhone user that was moved to try the Galaxy S8+ due to its large screen, beautiful design, and deep price discounts. Unfortunately, I had to return the S8+ after just a week and a half because it was unable to maintain a band 12 T-Mobile LTE connection. T-Mobile blamed Samsung, Samsung blamed T-Mobile, so I just returned the thing. I went back to my iPhone 7+ ready to put the whole S8+ experience down as a failed experiment. I originally ordered the S8+ from Samsung's website. The user experience of the purchase and return, compared to Apple, was crude and confusing. I had to call Samsung order support and tech support multiple times, every interaction with Samsung was awful. Everything I was told by support was wrong and they never followed through with anything they said they would do.But here's the thing, as I went back to using my iPhone 7+, iOS just felt so... boring. And the iPhone 7+ design, which I had previously liked, looked so... dated.Now let's face it, Android is a mess. Duplicated functionality, inconsistent UX, and the Android upgrade and update situation is pathetic. But Android felt exciting! And boy do I miss that S8 screen and overall phone design.Then there is this year's Apple contenders. Sure, Apple hasn¡¯t announced anything yet, but with all the leaks we pretty much know that two of the iPhones will continue the tired 3-year old iPhone 6 design, and the new AMOLED iPhone with that ugly notch?Have you seen the leaks of the Galaxy Note 8? What a stunner!I'll wait for Apple to officially announce, but if the leaks and rumors end up being true - call me a glutton for punishment - I¡¯m all over that Galaxy Note 8!Update: 9/19/17 - now that the iPhone X has been announced and the Note 8 is available, I bought another S8+, and this one is functioning just fine. I don't like the iPhone X's look (the notch), the price, and many of its new features aren¡¯t things I would ever use. I didn' see enough bang for the additional bucks to choose the Note 8 over the S8+.  With the Galaxy S8+, I think I have the best looking phone on the market today at a reasonable price (got it on sale), even if I have to put up with Android's goofiness.
            "
"680","The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is stunning from every angle. It¡¯s easily the  best Android phone I have ever held.The best display on the market currently.Great software experience.The camera works in every light and takes the best pictures.Reliable hardware and wonderful design, very fast.It feels great in the hand.Setup takes about few minutes then you get a software update, mine is unlocked and works great with Verizon.Bixby works OK as an assistant but you can always use Google assistant and it works great.It is an engineering masterpiece, outstanding performance and the finest big smartphone that you can buy currently.it comes with high end headphones.
            "
"681","I bought this S8 phone directly from Samsung as they were having a big sale just before Thanksgiving, plus they were giving $400 rebates on my old phone (a Samsung S7 I purchased from Verizon).  My old S7 was in great condition, but ... it was locked into Verizon, and despite what their offices will tell you, it's difficult to buy a SIM chip overseas to purchase service in order to avoid Verizon's high cost international plans.  When the phone arrived, I put in a new 64mb memory chip, enabled Wifi, logged into my Gmail account, and almost immediately Google started sending my apps to the new phone.  I spent an hour or two recreating my pages, and then the dreaded moment arrived - time to move the Verizon SIM from the old to the new, and either go online or call Verizon to associate the new S8 with my old SIM/phone number.  But ... amazingly, within 30 seconds of installing the SIM, the S8 became fully operational and was using my phone number!  Easy, peasy.  No logging into Verizon, wading thru their Customer Svc dept - nada.  It just worked!  So, how do I like the new S8?  Well, I could do without the curved glass, and don't like doing without the home button and the quick unlocking of the phone, but ... the battery life seems to be longer, although it's still a bit early.  Am finding that if I'm going to be away from electrical power it's best to disable the biggest battery hog of all time - Facebook.  It doesn't hurt to disable it, as it comes roaring back when you open it, but while in disabled mode it's not constantly polling the Mother Ship and drawing the battery down.  Oh, and the camera seems to be a wash versus the S7.  At some point, and maybe we've reached it - smartphones will have a level of perfection which - for all practical purposes - can't be exceeded.  Sorta like PC's.  About the only thing Samsung and Apple can do, IMHO, is to compete on the basis of price.  Tis inevitable.  Look at what's happened to the cost of laptops and desktops.

"682","Phone is heavy and too large, but if this is what you want then here it is. Is is very fast and so far seems like good quality (no battery issues yet). I am not sure it is worth anywhere near the price. I also have an Honor phone that was $500 less and it seems just as good
            "
"683","I got this phone from Verizon. It has lots of good features, but it can't be used with a Mophie juice pack because it keeps turning the screen on when it's charging. According to online discussion groups, it's a design flaw in the phone. I changed all the settings to keep the phone turned off. I called Samsung, and the tech took over my phone and verified that all the settings were where they should be for the phone not to keep turning itself on. No use -- it still turns itself on every few seconds, sometimes with a pop-up saying that the phone would charge faster with a charging cord from Samsung. The tech told me to do a factory reset, which is what they say when they have no idea what's wrong. That didn't work either, as other posters on online discussion groups said it wouldn't. The tech couldn't suggest anything else except sending the phone in for repair, but that seems pointless when it's not this particular unit that's at fault; it's a known flaw in the design. It's not as bad as catching on fire, as the Note 7 did, but you'd think that a company the size of Samsung could find engineers capable of designing a phone that doesn't keep turning the screen on over and over and over. It's especially annoying at night, when you turn off the screen, and seconds later it turns back on. You turn it off. It turns back on. You turn it off. It turns back on. If you plug it in with a Samsung cord, it'll stop for a while; but as soon as it's fully charged, here comes that bright screen again.
            "
"684","I found the opportunity to test the Galaxy S8+ fully expecting to have mediocre reactions to it. After a few weeks, I can confidently say this phone is pretty damn good.The biggest issue I had with samsung phones is the cumbersome overlay and bloatware that seemed to bring the phone to a grinding halt. My previous experience with the Note 4 wasn't lost on me. It worked well at first but lag made it a chore to use. It's only been a few weeks but I've noticed no lag. Apps open zippily; the camera is quick to use. No longer does it seem like there are a million useless apps to clog things up. The new Touchwiz interface seems much more sleek and the Samsung software actually useful. Whichever apps you don't like, you can simply disable. In fact, I find notifications that the phone has disabled unused apps running in the background very reassuring.The display is beautiful. Stunning image quality. I love watching videos on it. Yes, samsung tends to oversaturate images but you can choose to turn this down. Blue light display helps at night to reduce strain on my eyes. Edge-to-edge infinity screen with minimal bezels makes this a beauty to look at, and I receive many compliments on it.Picture quality is great on the camera. Low-light is OK, but day-and-night over my previous iPhone 6. I miss the dual-lens available on the Note 8, but for a single lens, this is great.Battery life is excellent. I use it pretty heavily for music, chat and web browsing through the day and I never run low. If I need a charge, fast-charge gives me a lot of juice with just 10-15 minutes plugged in.Cons:Bixby isn't great. It doesn't seem to wake up half the time with voice commands. While it's not necessarily bad, it offers no real advantages in my daily use to Google Assistant, which conveniently is also available on this device.Fingerprint scanner. Takes getting used to but with a case, is much more easy to find. Not a deal-breaker by any means.Speaker is terrible. There's a single speaker at the bottom of the phone which is easy to accidentally cover up. I use headphones most of the time, however, and as this is now one of the few phones that still has a headphone jack, is no problem.This is by far the best phone I've had, and I'm glad I went with this over the iPhone X which is going for nearly double the price.
            "
"685","I am extremely impressed by the speed, fingerprint, audio, and phone function.  It is a very expensive phone, but it changes everything.  You will get voicemail notification instantly.  Everything is so fast.  I test the download speed with 4G lte, 20, and upload speed 15.  The software is so sleek, I did not experience any difficulty when set up printing with canon application.  This is my first time for real print from a phone to my canon printer.  All my apps runs better on this platform except videos.  The phone should be wider so that the video would run bigger on the screen.Over all, it is beautiful upgrade that is very expensive.  I am happy with this decision.

"687","This phone is a great device so filled with bloat wear it's practically useless.  It's the most aggravating device I've ever used.  I'll never buy a Samsung phone again and I wish I bought another Google phone - pure Android, no junk apps.Bixby, Samsung's answer to OK Google, Alexa or Siri is the worst AI.  It's constantly prompting you and can never respond to your simple requests.  ""I'm sorry but I cannot do that"" is its response to most every routine request.  The auto-correct is obnoxious and changes words without warning.  The phone is also constantly trying to teach you how to use it by popping up tutorials you cannot close without completing.  Sorry but I've used a camera before I don't need forced tutorials.  And you cannot turn any of this off.  Bixby is there to sell you things so enjoy paying $750 for high pressure sales.  I could go on and on but I think you get the point.I really regret this purchase.Update 7/1/18 - The phone will no longer turn on. Adding final insult to injury, I will need to purchase a new battery just to see if that will work.  Never again, Samsung.  Never again.

"689","Just after 1 year both front and rear camera failed. Hardware failure, and guess what! the cameras are integrated into the M.B. which makes this a cost prohibitive repair. This fine flagship of a phone has also decided to randomly die with a totally drained battery in less than 8hrs. without any open apps or even using the phone. This was my first experience with a Samsung flagship phone. (I was an iphone user previously, owned every new Apple flagship phone up to the iPhone 7 without a single issue.) This will be my last as well. The feeling I get from Samsung is: Tough luck you should have bought an extended warranty! Nice.

"690","Had the S7 Edge and loved it. S8 plus? home button. Or should I say lack of a home button. Now it's on the screen and way to easy to touch.  Once again in an attempt to make something great even better they screwed part of it up. The screen chips extremely easy, even with protector. Got my S8 Plus at Best Buy, they recomended the screen protector, installed it and said its bullet proof now. 1 drop from about 18 inches. Screen protector shattered and fell off plus chipped the screen. Best buys response. Not our problem.  Would be an excellent phone if not for the home button and extremely brittle screen.

"691","I bought at AT&T store at a much higher price; that's a whole 'nuther story!  Pros:  Good camera, fast processor, sufficient memory, sharp display, that's it.  Cons.  It should be said I prematurely retired my perfectly good Samsung Mega (pre-Notes).  So this screen is way to small, small buttons, small type, small icons, small.  The wrap-around edge thing is bogus, just makes it hard to hold without a fat case.  Speaking, tiny thin flimsy and fragile.  The aftermarket is rich with contact screen stick-on guards and robust cases just so you can hold it without accidentally calling Russia, by accident.  Don't buy this stuff in AT&T store either. It'll cost 5x!  Strange charging cord, all my old ones are obsolete.  New Note isn't any better in size either; I liked my old phablet and they just can't be had any more.  You can still get the I-6S+ which comes close.  Really miss my old phone.

"692","This is the best phone out there and why would you carry an $800 phone in your pocket?? Especially without a glass screen protector?? That's a bad call and there are products out there that strengthen the glass. Why people choose to put them in there pocket is beyond me and I want to protect my big investment. I have an otter box case and screen protector on mine. I work construction and have had no problems with it. So quit complaining and protect your 800 buck phone. Duhhh
            "
"693","Operating System:  If you¡¯re a Samsung user, or even if you¡¯ve never owned a Samsung in the past, I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S8+.  This phone is by far the fastest operating phone that Samsung has ever made. This is the perfect phone for someone that spends a high amount of time on their phone and wants the speed of the phone to be able to keep up.  This phones operating system will not slow down for you, it will be able to handle anything you throw at it.User Interface:  This phone also has very friendly user interface.  You can make it as easy as you want, and on the other hand you can make it very customization with very complex setting that many people enjoy to toy around with.Battery Life:  The battery life on this phones seems to be incredible compared to the other Samsung¡¯s in the past.  Even with being on social media, snapchat, and the browsing the internet for several hours a day, you will usually end the day with above 50% battery life.  There are many settings that you can toy around with to make the battery better.  One thing you are able to shut off to improve your battery life is the ¡°always on display¡±, this is a feature that always shows what time it is, which uses unnecessary battery life.Water Resistant:  This is a great feature to have on a phone.  You never phone when you will accidentally drop your phone in the toilet, river, or other wet places.  You will enjoy the water resistant feature of your phone when you are able to fetch it out before there is water damage done to your phone.Fast Charging:  You will want to get this phone with the fast charger if possible.  Everyone hates waiting for their phone to charge, when you really need to use.  With this charger your phone will be charged in no time.Bixby:  The Bixby button on this phone is a feature where you tell it commands and it¡¯s supposed to perform whatever task you tell it to do within the phone.  This is a nice feature for when you would be driving or really anything that needs to be hand free.  The one negative thing about this is that the button for it is directly below the volume buttons, so it often gets bumped on accident and goes off.
            "
"694","Screen quality is great. Battery life is nearly impossible to kill in a 8 hour shift with heavy use. Curved screen is unnecessary and sometimes while holding the phone to watch a video you may mess with the screen accidentally on the edges. Speaker is in a terrible spot speaking of holding the phone sideways to watch videos your finger will cover the speaker. Dropped it once and the corner shattered, really disappointing. I think the one thing that has really bothered me the most was the keyboard/word prediction. It seems to not know English very well and corrects you with odd words or is somewhat difficult to customize properly. I had to download a different keyboard that is probably equally as annoying any way. Best thing is the secure folder with fingerprint or Iris lock capabilities I believe, fingerprint for sure. Secret web browsing mode as well. Hide certain apps/images/folders you name it pretty much. Don't know if I would actually recommend. Maybe buy used or if you get a really good deal with a gift card or something.

"695","The phone is great to use, but way to fragile for something to carry around with you everyday, making it impracticable.  I've only owned it for 3 months and the phone has been in a case with screen protector since day one, but already the screen has somehow cracked with no impacts that I can recall.  After some googling, turns out this is a very common occurrence for owners and that this is the most fragile screen square trade has ever tested.  I have been a big fan of Samsung over the years, but releasing a phone for close to $1000 with such a fragile screen is a really poor showing.  For those who's phones have not cracked yet, your day is coming...

"696","Very fast and feature-filled phone. Hardware delivers as promised and easily outshines iPhone. However, my phone screen cracked while I was in an airplane. The phone was not dropped or struck; it just started cracking from the bottom right corner while I was playing a game. The crack spread across the screen and was quite unsightly, but the phone was functional.I contacted Samsung who offered for me to mail in the phone (for free) and they would examine the phone and see if there was any fault in the manufacturing. For $225 they would replace the screen if the cause was not found to be due to an underlying defect.Well they just charged me and fixed the phone. I never heard anything or was given any sort of report in regards to whether or not this was a known manufacturing issue. I find that strange given their recent history with abnormal functioning phones.The phone was shipped to me as promise by UPS but Samsung did not insure the package nor did they require a signature on delivery for this 850 dollar product. Alas, the package was swiped from my doorstep. I followed Samsung's instructions and filed with UPS and Samsung about the incident. One week later UPS concluded the package was delivered accurately (duh, I knew that). So Samsung REFILED with UPS stating it was stolen. I was reassured that this was the normal sequence of events (Odd?). Anyways, I'm now on week three without a phone that I didn't exactly consent to being repaired and definitely did not consent to be shipped uninsured and without signature on delivery. Everyone at Samsung has stayed on script and has been perfectly cordial, but their policies are not helpful in minimizing the inconvenience their defective product has cost me (time off from work, inability to perform work functions without a smart phone, etc...).To conclude, an okay product without the company support to make it as awesome as it could be. Oh yeah, and a company with a track record of failing devices who still fails to perform thorough root-cause analyses on their products. At least with my n of 1.Note: 2 stars because, prior to the phone randomly breaking, it was a solid product.

"697","I have been a loyal Samsung customer for many years. However, that has come to a screeching halt. My Galaxy S8+ stopped working one night. I did not damage it in any way. Went to bed and it was fine, got up the next morning and could not connect to any network. Went to AT&T for help, they worked the problem for a bit , it was finally decided it had to be sent in to Samsung. They received my phone on Aug 8. They did not even open the box until Aug 13. I received emails from them that day that said this would be repaired in warranty at no cost to me and that the phone would be fixed in 5 business days. That was the last I heard from them. I, however, have reached out to them countless times now. I keep getting shuffled between repair support, customer support and executive customer support ( which by the way means nothing). I have spent over 7 hours total time on the phone with them, been hung up on, lied to about different department availability, spoken rudely to, put on hold for outrageous amounts of time. Finally today find out that my phone has been ""repaired"" twice now since sent in and has failed both of its quality control tests. Now it is being repaired a 3rd time and will have to go through ""quality control"" again. There is NO timeframe given for how long this might take. I have been told repeatedly that NO ONE there can make a decision to replace or refund a phone. I run a small business and I depend on this phone every day. It has been over 3 weeks since I've had it.....and there is NO care whatsoever from Samsung. Be assured, I will let everyone know that I possibly can about this horrible and unfair customer service. SHAME ON YOU SAMSUNG....this family will NEVER purchase another product from this company.

"699","Absolutely the worse phone I have ever owned. Battery life is sub standard. Purchased a screen cover, but the phone has a mind of its own, and the rounded edges make it next to useless to type or navigate, even when the screen is super clean. The phone looks large, but keyboards and apps appear small, and hard to use, due to the curvature of the screen, and the Bixby program that cannot be removed? is the most irritating application known to mankind. I will not be fooled again, never another Samsung product.
            "
"700","Theoretically speaking, overall this phone is dreadful. Pros are the variety of security features (face recognition, iris scanner and fingerprint scanner) and the option to choose themes. However, the cons definitely outweighed the pros. The cons that were definitely obvious to me were the lack of battery life, the poor picture quality (an iPhone 6s has a better camera than this phone) and constant updates. I have had this phone since September of 2018 and I am not happy with it. Just a heads up if you are looking into purchasing this phone.

"701","Wife recently purchased thru ATT authorized store. She loved the look and feel of the 8+ and at first, it worked great. However, within a few days it stopped working, displaying no network available error code on screen. Problem is, we were at home and my phone, an older Samsung S4 Active, also with ATT was working so there definitely was ATT network service available. Turned the phone on and off a few times, still no signal. Finally, using my phone, called ATT customer service. Forty five mins later with numerous instructions from ATT Agt, using my phone, finally managed to get her phone up and running with Agt stating he had found an error on the part of the store sales clerks initial registration process. Ok, fine. Fast forward 3-4 days later, same problem + phone was shutting itself off for no reason. Back to customer service using her phone this time. It would not allow her to make any outside phone calls or text messages, giving same no network available error code, yet it would allow her to dial customer service using 611, however. Another long conversation with ATT phone rep again who, this time suggested taking phone back to store and have the sim card replaced. Phone was now 16 days old since purchase. Did exactly that and store clerk changed out sim card. Still didn't work. Tried 2nd sim card on same visit and it didn't work either.  Store clerk then erased electronic serial number in their system, re-typed same ser # back in, reinserted 2nd sim card, rebooted phone and it finally worked but only for about 4 days before same problem occurred again. Problem is, she had to go out of town to a funeral and needed a dependable phone. She was so frustrated by now, she had ATT store switch sim card back over to her old iphone 5, which at least had always been dependable, if not very exciting. Thus she was safe on the trip, at least as far as having a phone she could count on again. When she returned home from funeral a few days later, she immediately called ATT customer service, once again explaining her problem. Another 30 min conversation and they now wanted to send her a refurbished phone replacement for a phone she was paying a new phone charge for, not a refurb price. She refused the refurb and the ATT rep finally told her he was making note in file, recommending the selling ATT store take it back. She also called Samsung directly and their rep told her to take it back to store and have them do a factory reset before sending it in to Samsung for warranty repair. Samsung rep was sure that would more than likely fix the problem. So she took the S8+ phone back to ATT store where she bought it, demanding a new phone, since they couldn't seem to fix it. They refused and in stead, sent her sixty miles down the road to an Atlanta Corporate ATT store, the Mgr of the selling store stating he was sure the Corporate store would replace it, what with the ATT phone rep recommending same. Corporate store mgr. was indignant, rude and emphatically refused, stating the selling store should replace it. By now, after several ATT dog and pony shows, failure on their part to do the right thing, my wife had had enough, drove sixty miles back to selling store, dumped the non working S8+ phone as well as the Samsung 8in Tablet they had also talked her into buying with the S8+, demanded a refund for all and a receipt for the returned equipment. ATT store clerk didn't have the authority to do an immediate credit, stating she would have to get the owner to do it over the next few days. Seven days go by with no credit on her acct so she now drives back to store, talks with the clerk again, who immediately credits her acct and credit card for all eqpt. Store clerk admits that this was 3rd Samsung S8+ returned within the last week for similar problems. Meanwhile, a few days later a Samsung factory rep comes by this ATT authorized store, poo poo's the apparent S8+'s problems, stating that it was just probably a bad batch of S8 phones, with no other explanation. Well, now my wife feels pretty much snake bit by Samsung and ATT over this uncalled for ordeal and is in all probability going to change to Verizon or some other carrier and I am sure, by now you have surmised she will not be purchasing a Samsung anything. She's too scared of them and what appears to be a lack of current quality control on Samsung's part compared to their good reputation in the past. Having been an ATT customer for more than ten yrs, she was very surprised and disappointed to learn of ATT's apathy and argumentative nature when failing to back up their phone with proper service after the sale. Additionally, I have been an ATT cell phone customer on my line since 1989(formerly BellSouth) and we are long time Direct TV customers. After seeing how she was treated I am also considering looking elsewhere for a different carrier and equipment, after continuously being their customer for over 28 yrs. Any company and any carrier can have problems. It's how they handle those problems that either insures brand loyalty or causes you to look elsewhere. All they had to do was to do the right thing to start with and give her a new phone that worked. Having refused to do that, what can we possibly expect from them in the future. We are currently paying almost $300.00 a month to ATT for our phone and Direct TV service. Even that did not motivate them to replace the phone, a phone which at the time was less than a month old. We sincerely hope your experience with both ATT and the Samsung S8+ phone is a better one than hers was. My phone is overdue for an upgrade but living thru her experience causes me great pause in considering any new Samsung product, inspite of fact that I have had my S4 Active for several yrs with no problems. I have never looked at another cell phone network provider in all my yrs of ATT service but I now feel compelled to at least see what they can provide.

"702","Weakest screen I've had on a phone. I had a Note7 and the screen was indestructible. When I brought it back to the store during the recall, after they refunded me they started throwing the phone to see how much force it could take before breaking. The store employees were tossing it high in the air and it would fall on their hardwood floor unscathed. They eventually got it to break after many, many throws but it withstood SO MUCH before finally shattering. I assumed the S8+ would have the same gorilla glass as the Note7. Nope! In fact, the S8+ has one of the most fragile screens out of any recently released phone. Look it up. Mine fell out of my pocket about 1.5 ft and shattered, also damaging the LCD itself. Additionally, I recently got an ""offer"" from Samsung as a Note7 owner to trade my phone in for a Note8-- they offered me ""up to $450"" for a phone that I paid significantly more for. This will probably be my last Samsung phone after my recent experiences with their products.

"703","I had a Nexus 6p, but it stopped working and I didn't want to fork out the money for a Pixel 2 so I decided to get the Sumsung S8 plus as part of Tmobiles buy one get one free deal. BOY WAS IT A MISTAKE. The Galaxy S8 is complete junk compare to my Nexus 6p. First of all the fingerprint reader is right NEXT to the camera!!! So it's very easy to mistake the Camera for the finger print reader when you are not looking and it usually takes me several tries to unlock the phone. Second the phone only have one speaker on the bottom compare to the stereo speaker in my 6p. And YES it does make a difference!! Third, the curve screen completely sucks, it warps videos and side of webpages and ebook. Lastly as of today, it still doesn't have support for the latest android software while my 6p already supported it. In all honesty if I had to choose all over again I would have chosen the LG V30 or Pixel 2 or IPhone X. Heck I would've chosen my old 6p over this phone. So yes please stay away from this phone, it's definitely not worth the price.

"706","The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is a smart choice for a smartphone. This phone serves all the purposes you would expect in a modern smartphone and does so tremendously well. With a 3500 mAh battery, it lasts all day displaying all your information, entertainment, and communication needs on a beautiful edge to edge screen with a 6.2¡¯¡¯ Quad HD+ Super AMOLED technology with a easy to use UI (user Interface).As someone, who has been on #teamiPhone for the last 5 years making the switch was not an easy choice but after analyzing the market and realizing that now in the Fall of 2017 is the perfect time to switch markets. I switched markets and I am enjoying the S8 + more than I ever did a new generation iPhone. After letting my mom (a baby boomer) play with this new phone, it became quite clear that she could operate it with about the same level of competency as her iPhone 6+ running the latest OS. Granted, there is a steeper learning curve for older generations with newer technologies¡¦I think it is safe to say that anyone at any age could operate the S8+ with ease and learn to enjoy life on the other side of the smartphone market. You should consider researching it further learning more about it¡¯s incredible durability, waterproofing, and hardware specs.

"710","BUYER BEWARE:The Galaxy S8 and S8+ has extremely fragile glass.  There have been many metric tests that have shown the glass to be very vulnerable to cracking, not good for a all-glass phone.  The SquareTrade testing resulted in the worst performing glass they have ever tested.My wife and I are big Galaxy fans, and pre-ordered the phones even with the Note7 issues.  We loved the phones until last weekend when both phones ended up with cracks on the edge screens.  There were no drops, or collisions, or any single event we could point to for how these cracks happened.  Our best guess is the cracks were from being in our pockets (also the cracks are from tensional forces, not impact), and we weren't playing basketball or wrestling, simple walking around town and at home.  It was the fact we were so gentle with these phones that has us dumbfounded.  It was after this when I researched and found they very poor performances in reliability testing on the S8 glass.My wife's phone crack originated from the interface between the edge screen glass and the Bixby button, her screen is unresponsive in an isolated area around that crack.  My phone's crack is originated from the bottom-right corner, and the entire screen now is unresponsive.  I cannot unlock the phone or even power the phone down.I contacted Samsung, and just like how they handled the Note7 batteries at first, they are not taking ownership of the issue and blaming the failures on the consumers.  Even though the Samsung warranty rep I spoke with slipped and stated that they were receiving a lot of reports of cracks that customers claim were not from any impact/drops.  Still they are taking the blanket stance that any screen cracks are user caused and voids the warranty, not taking into account all the real metrics showing the glass to be fragile and it's actually manufacturer defect.  I owned a S4, S5, S6, and S7 with no issues of screen cracks.Regardless, I'm sharing my experience and warning anyone thinking about buying the phone.  FYI, my wife had the Spigen Liquid Crystal Galaxy S8 Case and Zagg Tempered Glass, I had only the Zagg Tempered glass.  The cracks actually occurred under the Zagg glass, which the Zagg glass on both phones are crack-free.

"711","This is a great phone let down by one major flaw of a super scratchy screen. I have had an S3 and and S5 in the past and this was a step up. I love the display, the memory, the speed, and the color. If it was just for that I would have given this phone 5 stars. I have had this phone for only 3 days and there is already a bunch of scratches on the screen. And deep enough to pick up with your fingernail. I never had this problem with the previous Samsung phones. In fact I went caseless for the entire 2 year life of the S5 and only picked up one scratch when it fell to the floor of the truck once. I haven't treated this phone any different and have not dropped it or otherwise abused it but there are still noticeable scratches and marks. This alone makes the phone a ""DO NOT BUY"" in my book. Maybe if it was HALF THE PRICE but not at over $600. I seriously think that the screen isn't even glass but PLASTIC. A big step backward for Samsung.

The last repair technician said, that I should be very cautious about getting this phone wet as it has likely its not going to hold. I should have just cut my losses, payed a bit extra and just get the new iphone 8plus.Overall very disappointed in samsung phones...

However, when something goes wrong and you need to send the product in for service and repair, good luck!I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge earlier in the year after being a loyal iPhone user since the 3GS. When I made the switch I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked the phone. It worked flawlessly for about six months until a firmware update they release trashed the phone. Took it to a local Samsung rep. at Best Buy and he tried for a day and a half to replace the operating system with no luck. He said that it is still under warranty so send it in and they¡¯ll fix it. Sounded great, however.I called their customer service number and they stared a claim, she took my information down and told me it will take around eleven days to get it back, then issued me a UPS label. I sent the phone off to them and they send me an email on June 27th confirming that they received the phone and issued me a ticket number. So far so good right?Well after the first week when by I decided to check the status of my repair through the Repair Self Tracking portal they have and was surprised to see that there was nothing in their system about my repair claim. Though to myself, that¡¯s weird.On July 13th, after thirteen business days later of not hearing anything I called them again to check the status. They said that they were done with it but I gave them a P.O. Box address and that they can only delver to a physical address. Oh, ok I get it, a mistake. However, when the person who originally took my information shouldn¡¯t she have told me that they required a physical address? Still, not too upset. They told me that they would ship it immediately and I would have it in 1-4 business days. Great? Not so fast.Five business days later on July 20th I still had not received my phone so I called again. The Samsung rep I talked to this time said pretty much the same thing that the last rep told me and that it has not been shipped. Now I¡¯m irritated. I told him that they had the correct address now so what¡¯s the problem?  He put me on hold and checked with the repair shop and a Anne told him that they would overnight it today and I would receive it tomorrow. This is where it gets really shady. I asked this person to please send me an email stating our conversation and confirming that the phone was being shipped overnight. He told me that they do not have the capability to send emails. What? Samsung can¡¯t send emails? I was pissed off so I asked to speak to his supervisor. He put me on hold for a really long time and came back to tell me that his supervisor ¡°Graham¡± will not speak with me and that he doesn¡¯t have the capability to send an email either. Now I¡¯m furious. I¡¯m being lied to and this is getting really shady. I¡¯m not sure they even have my phone at this point. He put me on hold again and talked to Anne again who told him that when they sip it later today, I would receive an email stating that it shipped. I was not happy and expressed it vividly.I then went on the web trying to find another number to contact or call someone above them all with no luck. So what I found is that if these people want to screw you over, there¡¯s no one else to get involved or help. What a predicament.Later the same day (July 20th) I called again and talked to another representative name Angela. She checked the status and let me know that it shows on her end that my phone is scheduled to be shipped overnight and I should have tomorrow. I wasn¡¯t holding my breath at this point.We¡¯ll here I am now, today is July 26th and yes, still no phone. I am beyond upset and don¡¯t know if I will ever get my phone back. I¡¯m thinking I am going to have to get an attorney involved which will likely cost more than a new phone. I can tell you this, if this can happen to your phone, it can happen to all Samsung products. I will be switching back to an iPhone here shortly if I don¡¯t get my phone by this Friday. I caution you to ever think about buying another product from Samsung again.

"746","Look out for the guarantee when it is an international version because if something goes wrong you have to track down the manufacturer in whatever country it could be to see if he takes the repair. In my case I bought an international version in the US and Amazon would not take responsibility for the malfunction, nor the seller because it appeared a few weeks after the purchase, and nor Samsung USA because it was not manufactured in the USA. I has to track down myself the manufacturer who happened to be in East Asia. I had to shipped them my phone with no guarantee which I finally decidad not to do. I an stuck with a phone that does everything OK except the talking function in a phone call.Kind regards

First issue - the curved screen means that holding the phone by one hand and typing is difficult as your hand keeps touching the edge of the screen and screwing up typing.  Logged into Google, and begin porting over my contacts.Next problem - contacts show as synced, but several are missing.  As a test, I added a contact via google contact web interface (remember, the phone said it was already synced), and then kicked of another sync.  Again, contact no-show.  Mysteriously 2 hours later, contact showed up.Final problem (and when I returned it and bought an iPhone) - Voice mail never worked.  I didn't bother trying to figure out why, I just returned the phone and upgraded to an iPhone.

"779","I waited until recently to purchase the S8+ as my original intention was to get the Note 8 upon its release (after waiting a year after the aborted Note 7). However, all things considered it was difficult to justify the price of the new Note at almost $1,000 whereas the S8+ through Amazon was markedly cheaper.So, the decision was made and I am very happy with the phone as I was in desperate need of an upgrade from my S4 model. I got the S8+ as I was keen to have a larger screen and this screen does the job - large enough to watch videos etc but not so big that it feels awkward.  I haven't spent much time using the camera yet but it is certainly better than my old phone but not sure if it stacks up against my wife's iPhone.I am into the Android ecosystem and the phone worked seamlessly with my Gear watch out of the box.All told, I believe this phone is still state of the art and represents good value for money. I am not sure how much further mobile device manufacturers can go with new models at the $1,000 level but, IMHO, it makes sense to wait a while and purchase a slightly dated phone at a slightly discounted price as you still get lots of bang for your mobile buck!

"780","I'm reviewing the SM-G955FD unlocked model of the Galaxy 8+ sold by BuyeRush.I've bought quite a few unlocked international phones from Amazon and the results can be inconsistent. Twice I've received what appears to be proper full retail packaging with the manufacturer seal still in place. Another time I received was was clearly a knock off manual that was barely readable along with knock off packaging adding suspicion it was previously a floor model or refurbished. Another time the right basic phone but wrong model - an ATT branded version instead of an unlocked international version.Fortunately I received the right model from seller BuyeRush. Keep in mind the same listing may sometimes be supplied by multiple sellers with different standards in quality. The S8+ I received was in full retail packaging with the original seal still intact and included all the original accessories and additionally a plug converter since the ones included were for foreign plugs.The S8+ is a big phone. It feels like a slim, glossy, oddly weighted thing that wants to jump out of your hand at any moment. Definitely get a case with good grip on it.The screen is the best I've ever seen and works great in the Samsung Gear VR. App's run very good in VR too. To the point I forgot they are being powered by a phone.The particular model supplied by BuyeRush is also the cleanest ROM I've ever seen. That is to say there is not a ton of junk pre-installed on the phone. Particularly in the US you will end up with lots of carrier branded junk pre-installed on the phone eating up internal storage space that you cannot recover. The apps will also be un-installable though you can disable them after phone updates they have a tendency to still try to download updates themselves or otherwise just eat up battery life. All but 1 app that I wanted to remove has been fully uninstallable.The Bixby button is a little oddly placed but the main screen option is easily removed and the button can be fully disabled from within My Samsung also.Besides the size being a little akward for me personally, though some people might prefer it, the only thing real criticism I have is with a Samsung software update that appears to result in the built in gallery no longer asking what application to open video files with. Resetting default apps has no effect. Only reason I mention this is because the default app does not support codecs for videos recorded by multiple devices and in the past I could browse in gallery and then open in VLC.For ATT Users: Initially I could only get HSPA+ with my old SIM. Going into the APN settings I could not even connect to the NextGen selection. I ended up having to get a new SIM and also I was on the original true unlimited data plan from many years ago. This created some sort of conflict requiring me to switch  to the new ""unlimited"" (throttled at 22 GB) data plan. I now get up to 100 Mbs down and 20 Mbs upAlso keep in mind ATT is rolling out ""5G E"". This is not really 5G and if you have a non-branded phone it will likely still display it as 4G. If you have a branded phone it will show 5G E. Att did the same thing by forcing branded phones to display 4G for HSPA+This phone currently supports all but 2 of the band + frequency combinations for ATT USA.

"781","I was expecting something amazing after upgrading from my old Note 4, and this falls short of my expectations. Battery life is disappointing, even with most of the apps ""sleeping"". It's the one thing that needs to be addressed and fixed - a larger battery cell on a phone this big is probably something that most consumers would be OK with. I also don't really like the absence of a ""home"" button, and the Bixby button on the left side of the phone is RIDICULOUS. You think you're pressing the volume button, and instead you get the Bixby screen pop up. I've yet to use it - Google Assistant works like a charm on this phone and wakes up with ""OK Google"".On the plus side, this phone qualifies for Sprint's 1 year free unlimited bring your own phone plan.

"782","This camera has been reviewed about 18,000,000 times. If you're looking for some incredible insight or new understanding of how the Samsung SA plus works, there are lots of phone reviews that will give you the incredibly detailed evaluationI got this as a replacement phone for a significant other. That person has one basic need. To send messages, to make calls, and to get a camera that can take good pictures. I have the exact same phone but I have the note 8. I think the note 8 is the absolute best phone I've ever had. I use the pen for taking notes and making quick reminders. I also use the pen to edit the pictures and I have multiple photo editing programs. They require a fine touch and my fat fingers don't work.If you don't need the pen, this is the same phone and does everything but does not have this slightly added size and slightly diminished battery that the note 8 has. Apparently when they add the stylus they take a little bit away from the battery and add a little bit to the size and weight of the phone.Android on this phone works great. Yes it comes with tons of bloatware but it can be left alone or removed. Bixby is a absolute pain and the Bixby button is nothing but an annoyance. I downloaded an app that allowed it to be reprogrammed. Unfortunately, Samsung keeps updating the phone and seems to have an ulterior motive to remove the option of reprogramming the Bixby button. Fortunately, app developers are only one step behind and update the app the minute that Samsung seems to interfere with the app function.In the last year I've used this type of phone it has a great screen, great processor, incredible touch, and the O LED screen is awesome.I read a lot of reviews of people who broke their phone or commented that the touchscreen was diminished after they put a screen protector on. I've use this phone for a year without a screen protector. I understand the anger and hostility of people who broken their screen on a very expensive phone shortly after purchase. Unfortunately, accidents happen and any phone can have a screen that breaks due to either clumsiness or inadvertent shock.And, putting a glass screen protector on the phone will diminish the touchscreen capability. I have not used a screen protector any year, carry it in my pocket and have zero scratches. Take off your protector and enjoy the beauty of the phoneIn my experience, this phone is five stars. Great GPS, great Google voice recognition, great screen, processor works and seems to be able to handle everything you throw at it.

"783","I use my phones as tablets and teaching devices. The only unexpected good thing is I'm finding the audio, unlike some reviews indicate, to be good even for demonstrating videos for others.  The screen ratio is distorting, & not nearly as sharp nor brilliant as my old cheaper Samsung Galaxy J7. I've tried every combo for display etc. The up-lighting needed outdoors is still inconvenient to reach & not as good as the J7. The useful screen covers & phone cases haven't been created for those silly curved screens yet. (Hopefully they'll be gone shortly.) In the meantime if you want to collect finger prints for securely getting into the phone or for resurfacing that super glossy exterior then this is your phone! The reader does seem to be in the right place for me. Although it is a bit longer it appears so much smaller & distorted next to the J7 concept. Give me a J7 with lots more space:) I turned/took everything off that I could so  battery is better than my older 1 ever was, but considering I cut out the ""Always On"" & many others it isn't outstanding. I've seen reviews that put this ahead of the S10 so I'm glad I didn't sink the money into the latest!  I did for once get an good seller & checked before  ordering that mine would be USA Samsung warrantied & it is.

"784","Had it for 10months now, price has dropped by about 90 bucks since then.Supposedly made out of ""Gorilla Glass"" , sounds tough right? Well it didn't survive a drop from my hands onto a concrete floor, it's now cracked badly with chunks chipping off of the corners.  They should call it extra-brittle baby monkey glass and not give the material a tough name, because it isn't tough.The worst problem is that the phone has never been improperly exposed to moisture yet it now constantly refuses to charge and claims that it has ""detected moisture in the charging port"".  This is with OEM chargers and cords as well as aftermarket stuff.  I'm stuck trying to reboot the phone all the time to get it to stop complaining and refusing to charge.  Sometimes It will decide the phone is wet mid-charge and I go to pull it off the charger and it has fully discharged when I am expecting it to be full.It has been telling me software updates are available, hmm maybe there is a fix for the incorrect ""wet usb port"" message I have been getting.  Well I don't know because it will only allow me to download the update over WIFI, despite having an unlimited data connection that I use for 100% of my web use.  I took it with me to the gym and used their wifi to download the update and it installs.  Then it says there is another after I leave , so I use the grocery store wifi and it updates again.  Then it says there is ANOTHER so I go to a book store and it says it is fully up to date.  Then I leave and it renegs and says it needs to download another 1.5gig update...  Guess what, I don't have wifi because I use my phone to tether for web browsing.  And I'm tired of driving around bumming wifi, this is unacceptable when every other app can download or update with my 4G data connection.The specs are good and the screen gives a nice image.  I like that this phone still has an SD card port, I wish they still came with a removable battery like older models. However just like any other android phone I have had,  when I use it on roadtrips with a navigation app and pandora playing, one or both of the apps will eventually stop responding and the phone can get pretty warm while plugged in running that stuff for hours.  This isn't necessarily Samsung's fault, could be the apps. Anyway it often times requires a reboot to get everything running again which is very distracting and not appreciated while rolling down the highway.  Also can really hose you when the nav freezes up just before you need to navigate a complicated interchange.The screen / digitizer replacement is still VERY expensive, and I don't know if I want to wrap up any more money on this thing because it has a charging problem.  Would not buy again, which is pretty lame because I have had better luck with the non premium Galaxy phones in the past.

"785","I would recommend the international version of Samsung phones. They have better processors and longer battery life due to the patent issues with Apple.This phone is in mint condition and works perfectly.What to do firstbefore start using the phone connect it to WiFi and let it update itself for a while after you fully charge it afterwards it will be working really smoothly.Kudos to seller and Amazon for the great quality work. Amazon is reliable with expensive purchases.I tried this phone with many European cellular cards and also with at&t. All of them work perfectly.Long battery life and always on display is a delight to use.

"786","I purchased this phone as an upgrade for my HTC M9 that was getting long in the tooth and wasn¡¯t a good value as a trade in. I was going to go for a Hauwei Mate SE,  but research showed that it may not be a good match for my Samsung Gear S3 running Samsung Tizen software. Since I'm accustomed to the watch which played well with the M9, I spent the extra on the used S8 plus. Thankfully it arrived in near new condition and has worked flawlessly so far at a substantial discount for a larger size, high quality product with reasonable up to date specs, while I get to keep the full functionality of my watch. The Tizen thing kind of sucks since I did get a Mate SE for my wife and it¡¯s a great upgrade option to her M9 and she gets a brand new phone vs a used Samsung, Apple or other top tier phone, even if it¡¯s more of a midrange phone.
            "
"787","First off, I bought this phone with my own hard earned money and bought it through Amazon.  This is not a sponsored review.I've had Samsung Note phones because I like the big screens.  My old note 3 (which I loved) starting having problems with WiFi and GPS reception.  So I started looking for replacement phones and found this one.My carrier is Verizon. You have to go into the Verizon store with your old phones sim card so they can burn you a new sim card.  I was expecting to get a hard time from the store and was surprised at how nice the experience was!  They took my old sim, created a new sim in about 5 minutes with no charge!  Very nice.And now on to the phone.  So I was loving my old Note 3 and didn't really expect to have that much of a better experience.. wow was I wrong.So this is not a comprehensive review , just some of my observations and things that I really liked about this phone.  Also, bear in mind I've been using older Samsung Note phones for the past 5 years.  So all the tech upgrades are fun.- The screen:Almost as wide as the 5.7"" screen on my old Note 3 but is taller.  So text is almost as large but with more space for content.  Of course, resolution is amazing, colors pop and this thing gets really really bright.  The first time I used it in full sunlight I was amazed!  I could actually see text perfectly in FULL SUNLIGHT.  Wow... what an improvement over my old phone.  I was also worried about the curved sides of the screen distorting text and pictures and such.  No problem at all.  I still feel the curved edges are a bit of a gimmick but it does not detract from the usability of the phone.  And no I don't care about any of the edge menus and  stuff like that.- The CPU / SpeedI thought my old Note 3 was fast.  This thing is blazing fast.  I mean, everything you do is almost instantaneous.  Now I'm spoiled and expect everything to pop up instantly.- The CameraI've got it set up so that if you press the power button twice the camera comes up.  It comes up instantly.  You can take a photo immediately.  Then you can take at least 1 photo a second.  The photos look great.- The speakerIt's mono and on the bottom of the phone.  At least 50% louder than the speaker on my old Note 3, at that was loud.  I'm so happy with the speaker on this phone, I can listen to podcasts when I'm in the kitchen.  I just pop the phone on the granite counter and crank the volume and I don't need an external speaker like on my old phone.  Again, I'm pleased and surprised.  Phone calls on the speaker are loud and clear.- The fingerprint reader.Wow... It's instantaneous.  Seriously.  You place your finger on the sensor and it's on in less than a second.  So easy.- Weight and size.It's taller than my old Note 3 but lighter and slimmer.  Still fits in my back or front pocket fine.  I've got it in a case with a pop socket in the back.  Drilled a hole in the case so that the pop socket is attached to the back glass on the phone.  So the pop socket is secured to the phone, acts as a handle and a mini stand when I place it on a counter to watch a video.- Wireless charging.Picked up a $15 wireless charger from Amazon.  Very nice.  I just lay it on the charger when I go to sleep.  Super convenient.- SD card capable.Took my old 64 gig SD card from my note 3 and popped it into this one.  Nice, all my books and videos, photos and tunes came along for the ride.So anyway... I'm really glad I bought this phone.  no regrets at all.  I really don't have any cons.  I just dig it.Very nice upgrade from my Note 3.  Highly recommended.

"788","It is a nice phone with good features.But I have not been able to get good signal strength when compared to my old S4. I know that the ""bars"" don't necessarily equate to signal strength. But I am missing more calls now without it ringing or showing a missed call on my end than before. Sometimes I won't be able to make a call or one will be dropped, even when it shows 3 bars H+ (which is 3g I believe) So with the PHONE part of the phone, I am disappointed.If I purchased through my carrier I could have exchanged it with another one, or a different phone. But I tried to save a few bucks by buying on Amazon. Live and learn.

"789","I've had three different iPhones but I have been disappointed in the direction Apple has done with the hardware of the newer phones and price.  I really I'm glad I made the switch and Samsung Galaxy 8+ phone six months in is working great. My only complaint is the Bixby button is worthless and causes you issues at times when you meant to only change the volume.  Speaking of volume the external speaker is not all that great but I usually use head phones so no worries. Honestly I can do everything I did on the iPhone and more with the Samsung oh and I never have to worry about memory something Apple is pathetic in pricing as well.

"790","I just discovered that the Samsung Galaxy S8+ phone I bought in early October from Mercate is a dummy phone used for display.  I also received 3 iPhone chargers with this ""phone."" I paid $549 for an alleged phone that is empty inside. Why so long to discover I've been ripped off? I am the full-time caregiver for my 98 y/o mother with little time for myself. I went online & watched YouTube repeatedly trying to get the phone open. I purchased a charger. I couldn't believe I had been ripped off until yesterday when a technician opened the "" phone"" & I saw it was empty inside.  I am retired & not wealthy & sick to realize I might have given Mercate $549 for nothing.
            "
"791","My phone arrived yesterday afternoon. I was able to copy the data from my old phone to this one without any problems. I wasn't able to activate it for my provider - Metropcs. I had to go a store and the employee did that for me. All in all, the phone is working fine without any headaches that I was experiencing with my previous device. We won't mention the name of the company that sells this item.  The phone is much easier to work with, almost like an iPhone. I have had one in the past. This phone has lots of memory, so feel free to download all the apps you need! I may update this review if necessary. For now, I'm very satisfied with this phone.
            "
"792","I was thinking it would be smart to get the International version because of some travel plans however I was unable to get the Pay app to work and it apparently isn't programmed for 4G LTE, only 3G LTE, which made my signal strength only 2 bars or less (Hawaii). I took it to our local T-Mobile and they showed that the International version is missing a few other features so I returned it and got the US version of S8+ which works nicely. After answering a question by the seller I was granted easy postage-paid return.  BTW: The SIM card from my old Galaxy S6 works with the International and US versions of S8+
            "
"793","Box did NOT come with the Samsung factory seal, meaning it wasn't new.  I didn't even turned it on, just returned it.
            "
"794","The phone I received was model SM-G955FD which Samsung lists as Global edition. This did not work with T-Mobile Wifi calling  evern after upgrading Android.
            "
"795","My problem with buying a phone from a carrier has been after a few years, support for security updates were up to the provider. Problem is most smaller carriers do not maintain security updates. With this phone, you getting direct support from Samsung and getting the latest recommended patches.
            "
"796","This phone was not unlocked! Took it to Verizon and the tech could not get the SIM to activate. He tried 10 different cards so the problem was with the phone. I read other reviews that said the same thing.  HOWEVER...there is a workaround! He had to put the SIM in another new phone, activate it, and then switch it to my phone. So glad it worked because I really like this phone and it was a lot cheaper than buying a new S9.
            "
"797","This has to be the worst phone I have ever bought. I bought it in April of 2018.I have never had a Samsung phone before this one. I would rather use a flip phone than this.  Picture quality looks like a 1mp camera. Apps stay running after they are closed. Constantly restarting the phone because it won't pick up on wifi. After it restarts your good for a day or two. Everything looks good on paper but placing it in the real world is totally different.
            "
"798","Bought one that's used but overall a great device.Pros: fast, comfortable, great camera, awesome battery lifeCons: the placement of the Bixby button is awkward at times, a few bloatware apps, different USB type connector makes it a bit of a pain if you forget your charger.Essentially, if you're like me and buy a new phone once every few years and you have an s5 or older this one is definitely worth the upgrade.Edit(3/12): my only complaint with it is the random app crashes and the forcing of Bixby but with a remapping app it works wonders. If you need a new phone under $600 I highly recommend this phone.
            "
"799","What can I say. I love this phone. I works. Everything works. No glitches, responsive, beautiful screen. Every phone I have owned has had error outs setting up apps that I had on the previous phone. Not one error out on this one.

"800","The hardware is fantastic, superb looks and feels great in the hand.  The SOFTWARE is absolutely horrible.  It's so far removed from vanilla android it's like a completely different operating system, and you'll CONSTANTLY be annoyed with popups, nuisance reminders, and other annoyances.  It constantly feels like your fighting with what Samsung likes to call ""The Samsung User Experience"".  Samsung should give customers the ability and choice of running a vanilla port of Android and not this abomination of a UI,
            "
"801","No issues connecting to Verizon aside from a little difficulty fitting the SIM card from my old phone into the caddy that pops out of the bottom of the S8+--a tight fit!  Once inserted, the phone fired up immediately with no red Verizon screen on startup any more.  From there, no problems making calls and texting.  Would definitely buy again, though I wish someone would make a Verizon compatible phone with an even larger screen (7.0""+....anyone...anyone....?)
            "
"802","I worried about ordering 1 of these after reading the reviews over and over again.... I'm on prepaid straight talk.....omg ... all I did was take my SIM card out of my old galaxy s6 and placed in this one... well it works great.. the only problem I had was I have to put all of my contact's in... either from that please don't hesitate to  buy....my phone is brand new
            "
"803","I am very pleased with this phone.  Amazon shipped it promptly and it was delivered on time.  Moving from an S5 to an S8+ was so easy.  The screen on this phone is amazing.  You get that amazing screen without the phone feeling bulky.  It is so thin and feels great in your hand.  The battery life is incredible and the quick charge feature is great.  Getting a screen protector on the phone was a bit different with the infinity screen, but well worth the extra effort to protect the screen.  There are a variety of cases available.
            "
"804","I moved up from a Galaxy S5, so this was relatively easy for me to adapt to.  The speed is impressive, as is the image quality and sound.  I am most impressed with it's long battery life, which was easily twice as long as my S5.  I am enjoying my S8+ very much.  The only slightly negative experience was getting Verizon to activate the phone.  Two techs told me that it was not compatible with Verizon service.  I convinced them to take a SIM Card from a floor model an try it in my phone.  It worked, proving that it was compatible.  I still had to call a higher level tech to get it activated.

"808","This phone will get the job done. It's very well built. Slippery but it's a glass sandwich, get an otterbox immediately! You can map the finger print scanner in back to bri g down the top menu which is very useful. The sensor is in a weird spot but you can add a multiple fingerprints,  I use my two index and middle. Solves that issue. ""Facial recognition "" is quick but not too secure. Great processor for multitasking.  All around great phone.
            "
"809","I upgraded to this phone from a ZTE Zmax Pro.  This phone is incredible to any phone I have ever had.  It is very fast and reliable.  It's very well build and sturdy.  I had problems with other phones in my area with my carrier and with this phone, I have not experienced any issues with my signal.  Highly recommend.
            "
"810","Great phone, and good supplier. No problem working on US network (att). The model itself: don't like the curved screen edge (if you lay your phone flat the light from alerts can still wake you (or your wife) up). Also, really don't like Bixby (but I like my privacy and don't like listening devices on my phone and think people who buy Alexa or Google home are nuts, so there's that.)
            "
"811","If you love Samsung you will love this phone. Battery life is amazing for a large screen. Display is mediocre (hence the four stars). Easy set up and use. Phone works as expected. Only phone I have found that actually works with Android auto.

"813","Awesome phone!  Works great with no issues with Verizon Wireless.  I did have to go in and get a new SIM card however, since my old one was a micro-SIM, this phone uses the smaller nano-SIM card.

"814","Good phone. If you got the spare cash go for the s9 the dual speakers sound amazing.
            "
"815","I just upgraded from the Galaxy S5.  There's a little bit of a learning curve, but so far so good I love the phone.  I have verizon as my provider.  I went to the verizon store so they could help me active the phone, since I need a new SIM card.  The phone was activated with no problems.
            "
"816","Looks great (brand new actually), works great with my carrier which is actually AT&Ts Cricket Wireless. I was surprised with it being T mobile. But love how it turned out. And I love the phone in general.
            "
"817","The product came in great condition for a used device, no problems at all with operation. The only problem is the LCD has burn in on the screen and this WAS NOT mentioned in the description of the device. I emailed customer support 5 days ago and no one responded so I'm just going to assume they don't care. The burn in is slight but enough to be an annoyance, hence the three stars. Would return except I would be without a phone which I use in my work so I guess I'm stuck.
            "
"818","Undeniably Great! It took me a while to search through the unlocked international versions to find a high quality phone. I was skeptical about the purchase but decided to take the chance. It's perfect. I live in the British Virgin Islands and it works perfect with my two SIM cards. I was able to put the cards using following the instructions. That was new for me.  Great phone, great price .

"823","I wanted to use the phone for a couple of weeks before reviewing the S8+. I upgraded from a S6 and I am not disappointed. The transition went seamlessly except the S8+ will not let you transfer pictures from texts. This is a known issue with this phone and I knew about it BEFORE I bought it. There is a workaround this that requires a Gmail account and it is simple to do. Other than that minor issue this phone ROCKS!!!!!!!
            "
"824","I absolutely love this phone. I made the switch from apple to android with the latest phone updates and it was the best decision I could have made. There are so many more things you can customize with the phone and it's settings it really makes it personal.

"825","It definitely felt high quality and worth the price,  I only suggest that you check if your phone service provider support this phone, unfortunately for me, my provider doesn't so it's a glorified paperweight. Still love it though.

I choose this phone over the S9+ because it is the same size phone, has the same size battery but costs about $300 less than the S9+.  Only difference is the S9 has the 2 lens camera on back and the S8 has the 1 lens camera. Besides that, everything else seems the same. Picture quality on this phone is still excellent.

"845","Love the phone. Chose this over the Snapdragon version because I always get comments about bootloader being locked with the US version so I went with the international and I'm loving it.

I cannot register it and most importantly I cannot get any updates for so""smart switch"" smartly I could find a work around for this.  However I have been told by a Samsung rep to my face that it is likely that I will always have problems with this phone and quite possible that I do not have enough technical expertise to get the first major software update via smartswitch.  I spent the return window trying to get things to work correctly and did not get to a Samsung rep in person.  All of this is my fault.  I have made an expensive mistake and do not know what my options are.  I have been too trusting of Amazon.  I know they don't really screen the products they list but I used to trust them more than say  EBay.  My advice is don't trust anyone.

"905","I have read a lot on this phone  and the reviews do not give it justice, on an unlock phone I had no problem going through Verizon to get a SIM's card  (my Galaxy Note 4 had a larger card. They did have to go to the 800 service to acknowledge the phone but it was up and running in no time. I do recommend a LifeProof case (Fre) it makes it water proof for those who do not want to scratch the screen it's warranty is great. This phone is fast and I was able to transfer all of my apps with Samsung smart switch app easy as pie. If any cons show up I will update this review.

I did not know until they sent me the phone with a piece of paper stating so, but nowhere online did it say that!!

I have to decide to use Samsung or Google software for everything!  I wish I had known Samsung decided on this version to become more of a software company and push more than the last few phones to dominate over Google.  The phone itself is beautiful.

"1007","i had not realized phones had progressed this far.  this phone is much more configurable than any i had in the past.  i was reading a review of the next new iphone, and this phone already has all the features that were mentioned.  why pay over $1000 for a phone that women carry in their back pocket and sit on? i love that the fingerprint feature can unlock the phone, and some apps that require a login.  my boss was looking at the phone, and was gaga over the camera.  he discovered the zoom feature, and loved it.  i asked t-mobile about the cost of a card, and paid $26.  was told that yes, i could move to other network providers without having to purchase a new phone every time i moved.  purchased a metal case, worrying that the quick charge feature would not work, but it does.  the battery is extraordinary.  holds 8 hours without significant decay, and with the quick charger, will go to full charge in 15 minutes or so.  i purchased the quick charger at the phone store, and found it very convenient.  just lay the phone on it, and done.
            "
"1008","The phone malfunctions so much. All sensors goes on and off. Very frustrating, am in Nigeria, returning the phone to get a replacement is so cumbersome. Wont be buying a phone online anytime soon. Also, wanted a dual sim version, was so disappointed to see it is a single sim version.

"1014","Just received it and the home button does not work. The pressure sensitive button works maybe 1 out of 10 times. It's also a different model than what Amazon says it is.

"1030","Screen broke after a few months of use. First time I've ever had that happen on a ""flagship"" device. Back to the aging Nexus 6P I guess.Oh and when I called Samsung about it they wanted $300 to replace it.Then when I said it was the international version they said they couldn't help me. I had to call the Samsung office in the country it came from. I don't get why that matters. It's going to be a call center run by a bunch of hard to understand Indian morons anyways.Thankfully Amazon gave me a refund.
            "
"1031","phone looks nice and works with most features.  I am on AT&T and can not use many of the features due to communication of AT&T and Samsung.  Waiting on a patch to make wifi calling and HD calling and voice calling work.  I would have been happy to know this before I purchased.  Spoke to samsung and AT&T for hours.  Neither were any help.
            "
"1032","I have many Samsung products, and am happy with all of them, but I am not happy that this phone requires not just one, but two proprietary pieces in order to charge it properly, or one just to hook it up to another device. It does not have a Micro USB connection, it has an adapter that you need to use just to hook it up to a Micro USB cord. If you plug the USB end into any normal charger, or even a USB port on a computer, the phone takes FOREVER to charge (25% charge over 8 hours). You need to plug the cord into Samsung's ""adaptive fast charger"" in order for it to charge in a reasonable amount of time. The whole reason I buy Android instead of iPhone is because I don't want to have proprietary software, hardware or peripherals, I want to buy things that work across multiple devices. I have Micro USB cords everywhere, at home, in my car, at work, one stashed in my luggage in case I forget to pack one on vacation... now, they are all useless to charge this phone unless I happen to have not one, but both of the proprietary parts needed to charge the thing. Unless, of course, I pay them just to have extras so that I can conveniently charge my phone anywhere that I am. It really seems like Samsung is trying to separate themselves from all other Android products by having their own charging devices, and they even have their own Apps and a Browser. All of this I can avoid if I choose, except the charger part.I, like others, have most everything set up through Google, but Samsung wants to force you to use their Apps and software, like Bixby, their version of a personal assistant. And there is no way to replace Bixby, you can turn it off, but the home key is forever tied to this app. I don't want thing that only work with Samsung, I want things that work with Android.The phone does not have a way to double tap a notification to open it; you need to unlock the phone, then open your notification. I've researched this online, and others have the same complaint and no way to turn on that functionality.
            "

"1036","I'm very disappointed. I ordered a international phone and it said on the box to use only a American SIM card. Needless to say, I had to return the phone. What's the point of ordering a INTERNATIONAL phone if that's the case.

"1037","I liked it but some apps are came with Korean version, i hope the device also fro korean but seems to samsung pay is not working. Apart from that delivery and other things are good.

"1040","very nice Toy and functional
            "
"1041","I know 5 people worth the S8 plus... Between the 5 of us we've had 6 (mine twice now) broken screens.  I'm very disappointed with how fragile this phone is.  Unless you get a cast that fully encases the phone and takes away the edge functionality, the phone will remain very susceptible to breakage.  Other than the screen breaking twice in two months... I love it!
            "
"1042","This phone is great except for the fact that the screen scratches incredibly easily.  Just going in and out of my pocket the phone shows a multitude of scratch marks running up both edges of the face and randomly across the front.  All I can say is that gorilla glass 5 is definitely not where it's at.  If the screen didn't scratch so easily I would definitely recommend this phone but because of it I would definitely wait for something else.

            "
"1054","If Customer Service is important, STAY AWAY. The phone is great but if it needs service, don't count on Samsung to do what they promise. My phone arrived with a scratch in the Gorilla Glass. I talked to a Samsung rep who said they would for sure repair that and we arranged to have my phone sent in. They ask you to send in the charger and cable too, so I did. After a week, I received a $300 quote for the repair I was told would be no charge. By the end of the call, they agreed to fix the scratched glass. Another week went by and I received my phone completely unrepaired and missing my charger and cable. I called back and the rep I spoke to said the repair was approved but somehow it was never authorized so they just sent my phone back to me. After further discussion, they PROMISED to take care of the screen and asked me to send in my phone. I trusted their promise and sent in my phone. After two weeks, I received my phone back, again unrepaired. Another call to customer service later and they couldn't tell me whether they were simply inept or if they had just lied to me. The experience has left me sour for not only Samsung phones but for all other Samsung products as well. As far as I'm concerned, if it's a Samsung, it's not going into my house.
            "
"1055","I read the reviews on this phone it was supposed to be compatible with Sprint services could not connect through Sprint they said I had to go to AT&T can't believe that  Sprint was trying to drive me away from them had to return the phone because they could not put in a SIM card . I was very disappointed I was looking forward to having a new phone.

"1056","I LOVE SAMSUNG GALAXY S8+ .
            "
"1057","My wife and I have had the Samsung S8+ for a little over a week now. I am an avid Samsung Galaxy user, and have been using them since the 4th generation. Here are the pros and cons as I see them to this device.Pros:- Android Nougat is a very smooth OS. It's a definite upgrade from the previous versions. Just keeps getting better.- The cameras on this phone are both amazing. Makes great photos!- Very slick design on phone, aesthetically speaking. It looks very nice.- Comes with a nice variety of accessories, including adapters for charging in case you want to use a micro-USB charger or want to hook up a USB cable accessory for any reason.- Extremely good graphics on this device. Resolution is phenomenal.- Wide range of settings for customizing your user experience and security. (Even more than the usual for an Android/Samsung device)- Continued to allow for external storage, unlike the S6, which made me very happy.- I haven't put the water resistance to the test, but I'm assuming it's as good as the last model. Glad it's there.- The full screen layout is very nice for movies and gaming. I adjusted to the homescreen button being part of the screen almost instantly.Cons:- This is an EXTREMELY fragile design, especially the back of the phone, which is also coated in the Gorilla Glass, from what I can tell. My wife dropped hers from about 10 inches, with a case on, on the 5th day of ownership. The back of the phone cracked, chipped, and spider-webed all over within just a few hours. The phone was insured through our carrier, but the cheapest solution was to send it in to Samsung for a $75 repair job (plus shipping and handling). I would strongly recommend using a reputable case and screen protector at all costs. And be sure you insure this device. Lots of the durability tests that I have seen on YouTube have exposed this design flaw as well.- The headphones that come with the phone aren't that great. In previous editions, they provided Samsung-brand headphones that sounded great. It looks like they've started using another company to produce their headphones. There is very little bass or mid-range in the sound, so if you use your headphones for music, gaming, or videos, be prepared to get a better brand.- The new Bixby application via Samsung... I'm still trying to adjust to it. It's Samsung's version of Google Assistant/Siri. It's not that it's not a useful concept, but you don't get much of a choice but to use it. There's a dedicated button on the left of the phone that can not be deactivated from what I can tell. It's right below the volume button and is easy to press unknowingly and can get annoying quickly. I hope Bixby grows on me.- The voice command features for both Google and Bixby is weak in this edition. I have had to reprogram my voice recognition settings about 5 times already, and it still only picks up the commands about 30% of the time. Oddly enough, it works much better for the Bixby service than the Google Assistant service. (That struck me as a bit suspicious)- The speech-to-text application in general took a step backwards with this edition. My S7 and S6 both did a wonderful job for the most part of translating my speech. This phone, however, has massive errors in its translation. It hyphenates words that don't need to be and substitutes words incorrectly, and often. I have to speak EXTREMELY slowly and phonetically in order to get it to work. The fact that I have a Southern accent doesn't help whatsoever. This was one of the worst drawbacks for me, personally, because I use the speech-to-text feature often with my work.Overall: It's a gorgeous phone with some definite upgrades but concerning drawbacks. If I were Samsung, I would put a lot of emphasis on making a more durable design on the future editions. Worth buying - just keep it well protected.

"1058","this Samsung terrible sound speaker don't have a good sound, in the max hear distortion, the camera is awfull with low lights or in the night.is a little bit slow considering that have a big processor and enough ram.I try the camera phot and video don't have a good quality.the face recognition don't work with low lights.a big error is putted the volume keys in the left side, is practical in the right side.the battery is low, lost the charge very fast..I did a mistake to buy this expensive cellphone...

"1059","Just fantastic. This phone out performs the competition on every level. I've heard a lot of complaints about where the finger print scanner is, but these reviwers must not have actually held this device. Once you hold it in your hand your index finger goes exactly where the finger print scanner is! So just use your index instead of thumb, it is incredibly natural and I actually find it faster to use than my previous s6 with its scanner in the front.The phone is faster than fast and handles everything with ease. Most impressive is its long battery life, my previous phones used to die halfway thro the day, this thing still has 30-40% juice left at the end if a very long day.Screen is great, the software is optimized. I love every aspect of this. A real professional's work. You will be more productive with this tool.

"1061","Screen is EXTREMELY fragile.  Featuewise and style, this phone has everything.  But the screen cracks from simple drops.  In my case it went from my lap, bounced off my foot and flat on the floor.  Picked up and had multiple fractures throughout the screen.  The local repair shop wanted $400 just to repair it!  Sorry Samsung. Build a beautiful full featured phone that can take at least a little drop!  I would not recommend this unless you are willing to shell out extra for a good extended warranty.  From what I've learned, its not ""IF"" the screen will crack its a matter of ""WHEN"".

"1062","I recently traded in my galaxy S6 for this galaxy S8+. I am just going to say the 6 was way better!! The talk-to-text feature is horrible, the preemptive text is a joke - on the rare occasion it actually gets the words right AND spelled correctly, it capitalizes all the words it is trying to correct or thinking you may want to say next - even if it is the middle of a sentence!! Then there is Bixby, which, well, just no. It is all bad. Then there is the cutting edge camera in this phone which is really just ok unless you want to zoom in and, no matter, the lightin, you may as well forget it. I definitely miss all the things about my Galaxy S6. Buying this S8+ was a huge mistake. The only good feature on this phone is the size of the screen. I love the Galaxy phones, but this particular model is just a huge fail! I would definitely recommend skipping this model for an earlier one or hopefully the next one that cpmes out will but a lot better. Veey unhappy with this phone.

"1063","I recently offered my Galaxy s8 plus to a loved one for a bargain price, intending to buy a Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL. A day later, I sheepishly reneged on my offer. Reason: neither the Pixel 2 nor the Note 8 nor any other Android contender could best this bad boy. Speed, size, display, camera, overall experience <U+2014> No other phone can touch the s8 plus with the possible exception of iPhone X, and, as an owner of both who loves his iPhone X, I can¡¯t see any reason for an Android user to switch platforms. My biz phone is iPhone, home phone is s8 Plus, and the 0nly tiebreaker is my Apple Watch 3 LTE. THAT is unrivaled, but if you¡¯re wed to Android, the Samsung Gear 3 is pretty darned good. As regards phone design, Apple has caught up to Samsung with the X, but not convincingly passed it. I love both phones and couodnt part with my s8 plus even though I had promised it to a loved one and always (except when pardoned by a generous loved one) honor said promises!
            "
"1064","The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is one of the largest phones in the market yet it is hard to believe how slim it is. The Infinity Display makes for a huge beautiful screen, which is great for multi-tasking, watching videos and editing pictures, without the distraction of buttons. The size can be a drawback as it is hard to use only one hand unless you activate the one-handed mode. The increased battery size gets me through the day, better than previous models. Having used the fingerprint authentication on my phone for several years, I was a bit disappointed in the placement of the S8¡¯s scanner. It is hard to reach, requires me to pick up my phone and I keep smudging my camera. However, I switched over to the iris scanner and it is amazingly fast. I wear glasses and it has worked with them in various lighting conditions with only an occasional adjustment. Some additional features are included with the camera, such as masks and stickers, similar to other social photo apps, and one unique feature is using Bixby search. Though it is not 100% accurate, it does a decent job of finding similar objects just by the picture. It is actually kind of humorous to see what other things it comes up with, like my buddies dog was identified as a Labrador retriever, horse and cattle. He does seem as big as a horse or cow though. Bixby is an interesting feature that is Samsung¡¯s attempt at competing with Apple¡¯s Siri and improving on their own S-Voice. With the dedicated button you can avoid the usual opening commands of ¡°Hey ¡¦¡± or ¡°OK ¡¦¡± and go straight into what you need. You can still use the voice command of ¡°Hi Bixby¡± to get things done if you choose to, but I prefer to just hold the button and start dictating. Bixby does all of the usual commands to help you easily send messages, place calls, set timers and reminders. You can also get Samsung Reward points by using Bixby and gaining experience points. This includes just playing around with Bixby and asking some ridiculous questions like ¡°rap for me.¡± In return your earned points can get you gift cards or chances to win prizes. Bixby will also read off the time, weather and news highlights aloud for your alarms, a nice touch when waking up in the morning.
            "
"1065","Bixby fail. before you purchase this phone do your research on Bixby. You are unable to turn it off or remap it. If you're not going to use this feature be prepared to constantly turn it off because Samsung deceitfully placed the launch button right under the volume button so your hands/fingers constantly hit it launching this under developed feature. Trust it will be come very frustrating every time you sleep your phone, put it in your pocket, take it out of your pocket or in general touch your phone. Terrible trickery. You've been warned.

"1066","-Bottom line, this phone is a piece of junk for the price.-I can't delete pictures anymore... I've tried to delete the same picture 6 times now and it keeps showing up when I go back to my gallery.-Everyday I have at least one update of a new glitch, flaw, or problem with this phone.... this is my most updated review because of how terrible this phone is.-New text message notifications do not go away. I've opened the message twice and closed it and it's still telling me the message is new...-Received a notification today that I've never seen before. The app ""SYSTEM"" was causing problems and needed to be closed... don't I need the system app?-Power button does not function, it takes at least 2-3 presses to get it to recognize the press.-Screen was heavily tinted red right out of the box, I needed to adjust the color settings to turn the red completely off.-""Person is typing..."" text box is right on top of the most recent text so you cannot read it.-FINALLY, they gave an option to disable the Bixby button, now I just have a completely useless button on my phone. Maybe it could be remapped to be a fully functional power button since my phone doesn't have one?-Pictures sent via text message take 5+ minutes to send, fail, and then resend in a minute.-Battery life is getting worse with every update, I used to be able to use my phone over a 48 hour period without charging. Now I have to charge it every 24 hours or less.-Automatic brightness that adjusts to your patterns is a nice feature. However, in sunlight it defaults to max brightness and you cannot change it. Compared to the S7 this phone is nowhere near as bright. I frequently have problems seeing the screen at max brightness, blacks blend together and any dark movies are unwatchable.-Audio is acceptable, you can't expect much from a single speaker on the bottom right of the phone... Volume levels are poor. Any background noise beyond a fan will make it difficult if not impossible to hear dialogue in a movie at max volume.-Auto rotate works when it wants to, never when you want it to.-Word prediction and swyping on this phone is as bad if not worse than previous Galaxy models. I think it is worse because I'm getting strings of letters that are not even English. I never lift my finger off, and swipe very common words, and end up with gibberish. Some examples: planning changes to pls no do, sending changes to section, doing changes to don, what changes to Wyatt, checking to cur king, stay to starry, anything to abutting, constantly to com subtly, maybe to mary be, keep to Leo, on to oob, something to sobering, today to fist, someone to sombrero get...

"1067","Phone works great but extremely disappointed in the design.  In this case front glass replacement.  Doesn't matter if you have insurance or not it's gonna cost you 150 to 300 dollars.  I consider this a design flaw but Samsung is pleading otherwise.I dropped my phone only six to eight inches off the ground and cracked the front screen.  I've had other phones like the note 3 and 5 and were dropped from higher places and screen fine.  I'm just fortunate enough to have my touch screen still working for now.I'd rate this phone better if it was designed to easily replace the screen.

I see some reviews complain on here about features that can be easily disabled.... which makes no sense... one if you dont like a feature it can be disabled ( bixby, always on display)  but why pay $500+ for a phone to not get the most out of it.Pros:1. Battery life is amazing, i can have this game playing a game for hours with brightness and graphics all the way up and then look at my battery life, and it still be 50%2. charge time is better, with the provided charger, and pugin  it takes less than 2 hours to charge 0-75%.3. Bixby... although many dislike her, this is the best attempted AI ever provided.  It learns what apps i use and what times i sleep. always watching but a Great mobile AI... want to say the first I believe. (yeah siri isn't AI, it doesn't learn based on past inputs as bixby does.)

"1070","Samsung has created a wonderful upgrade to the S7. First of all, the 8+ has an increased screen size with superior clarity. The resolution is by far the best that I've seen on a smartphone. Also, the camera is very easy to maneuver with great quality pictures. There are many options to use to get creative. Next, the internal storage is quite adequate and double the S7's. My favorite feature is the battery life. Prior phones seemed to need charging constantly. The 8+ holds a charge very well and requires minimal charging. Since I am often ""on the go"", this feature is invaluable! Finally, the processor is far superior. I immediately noticed a difference when using the S8+. However, I would be remiss not to mention a couple of points that have been difficult to become accustomed to with this phone. The S8+ does not have a physical Home button - which I miss because I am a creature of habit. Also, I am constantly hitting the Bixby button when I am attempting to reach the volume buttons. The positioning of the buttons has been a bit challenging. With all of the positive upgrades, I would definitely recommend this smartphone.
            "
"1071","Pros:* Battery life is great.  I got a full day off of one charge with regular use.* Screen is bright and vibrant* Camera is greatCons:* Curved edges to the phone make it slippery and slightly distort the image.  They make the phone pretty to look at it when it's off but that's no that point.* Fingerprint sensor on the back is hard to reach. Plus, it's right next to the camera lens so you smudge up the lens trying to read your finger.* Comes bundled with Samung's Bixby AI assistant that you can't uninstall.  It's triggered off of a button on the side that is only used for Bixby.Moved to this from a Note 4 and I miss my old Note.  It was easier to hold and non-rounded edges gave it more usable screen space.

"1072","The most amazing phone I have ever owned, hands down. Also the best phone money can buy. Everything about it is amazing.Let's talk about the screen. It's taller so it fits in your hand better, and also had a higher resolution. The OLED panel on this phone is amazing and Samsung is known for it. The best in the market. Also, the almost border less design is great. No problems at all with accidental touches or anything. Works amazing.Next is the camera, best in the business really. Beautiful and highly customizable. Even has all kinds of filters and Snapchat like add ons. 12MP is still great.The battery is good as well. While battery tech is still paltry in any phone, the s8+ does surprisingly well with its massive screen. I get about a days worth (8 hours screen on time) with one charge. Pretty decent. And let's talk about the fast charge, 2nd fastest behind OnePlus only taking just under 90 minutes from 0 to 100. It's fast.As a phone, this thing can do and okay anything. Any task is doable with this phone. It has the latest Snapdragon 835 processor, for the best performance and battery life. Every game, video, or app works on this, easily.Experience is just amazing overall. Android is getting better day by day, the hardware is amazing, the software is fluid. This is by far the best phone out there. Bar none.

"1073","Overall very durable except many small problems.Pros, takes amazing pictures, 4k video. Screen hd quality is great.Cons, Screen burned in after just 4 months. Battery life is terrible about 20% by 3pm, bixby is useless and keeps re enabling itself after every update, lack of free Samsung app store apps, moisture detection port false alerts therefore cannot charge with power off, the sound from the speakers is very weak.It's been an ok phone over the last year or so but I will not buy another Samsung device.

The camera is so nice and it shoots great video. It works well with my S3 tablet too. The only other thing I really do not like id Bixby. I wish it would just go away.

"1076","I was trying to decide between the Iphone X or the Samsung 8 Plus.

Also transfering data from your old phone was very simple with Samsung connect.Last but not least..price..you would have to pay $300 more for the X !I had the S8 for one day and is a great phone!

"1077","BIXBY IS TERRIBLE! Every time I pull my phone out she says ""there are two ways you can find me."" There is no way to turn Bixby off, only silence her. This has driven me insane.

"1078","My wife upgraded from a fairly old phone (the Nexus 5), so this was a huge leap to the next generation for sure! The photos it takes completely rivals any other phone I've seen (including my S7!) and not to mention it even seems sharper than my friends' iPhone pics. The phone, albeit on the large side, has an absolutely GORGEOUS screen and makes browsing and interacting an absolute pleasure every time it is fired up. Only drawback is that it's very difficult for one handed operations, but I'm not going to ding the number of stars for that because my wife knew what she was getting herself signed up for when purchasing such a large phone.
            "
"1079","Most of the time when I upgrade a phone it really doesn't seem like it was worth the upgrade. This time I went from the S7 to the S8+ and wow this phone is really a step above. At first I didn't think I would like the fingerprint scanner but after using it a few days I really like the location. Easy to use one hand to unlock and resize screen if needed. Only negative thing I have to say right now is BIXBY! It is annoying.
            "
"1080","If the device gives you the periodic urge to smash it into a solid object, you should not continue to own that device.The problem comes from the overly sensative moisture detection firmware. If you live in a humid climate, you are bound to get the ""moisture detected in the chargin port"" warning; even if the device has not been in direct contact with liquid.Despite much effort to clean and dry the charging port, followed by clearing the cache memory and even doing a factory reset; the issue will sometimes persist.The otherwise excellent device is too expensive to be unreliable.

"1081","Nothing but problems concerning the SD Card. I went to Best Buy and got assistance from a Samsung tech, I even sent it down to Texas for repair at a Samsung facility. They returned it and said they fixed it but I still had all the same issues. I'm done. For the amount of money you pay for it, it should work correctly out of the box. Returning this shortly and looking into an LG. Very, very disappointed.

"1082","I fully expected this device to be bloatware free. It's not. Even when you ""disable"" the app there are services from that app still running in the background.

"1083","I purchased this phone on a Monday, by Thursday the back was cracked. I never dropped it, I never bumped it, I never even put it in my pocket with anything else. When I contacted Samsung they said that I could send it back and be without a phone for a week, and then they would determine if it was a manufacturing defect (and fix it) or decide that it was user abuse (and they would charge me to fix it or return it broken). Since this interaction, it is clear to me that Samsung does not stand behind their products, and that they do not care about customer satisfaction.
            "
"1084","The glass on my phone broke while it was in a case in my pocket. You can't find repairs at a reasonable price anywhere making the phone effectively a paper weight. I will not purchase another device from Samsung again.

"1085","I like the quality and the features. My old phone was purchased with AT&T and the Sim card would not fit the S-8,  but I took it to an AT&T store and they gave me one that would fit in less than 15 minutes. The tansfer of old files to the new phone was smooth and without a hitch.

"1086","Purchased from my network provider not Amazon. SD Card slot doesn't work.  This is well documented, if you search google you will find it's a common complaint.

Not only does the phone's screen break easily (see many of the other 2 & 1 star reviews) but it costs about $350.00 to replace.  I guess I'm going to have to go back to Apple after being a Samsung customer for the last 3 years (my Galaxy S5 Active without case was dropped at least 3 times without any damage).Samsung has lost another customer.I bought this phone on pre-sale from Best Buy so you will not see a verified purchase note on this review.

"1098","Ok, so they ""say"" it's refurbished, but I truly think this one I bought for my hubby was brand new (still on Japan time) from Samsung & nothing in the box was generic, it was all Samsung.! Great purchase, & it came the Same Day I bought it.!!!
            "
"1099","I bought mine through Verison. It is $35 a month with their unlimited plan. I added a 200GB Samsung brand SD card, and I put a Clayco protective case on the phone.So far, the battery is great. It will last days on power saver mode, and several hours in high performance mode.It plays Super Smash Bros Melee with the Dolphin Emulator with relative ease.I use a Blue Tooth game controller for that, and it's great!

"1100","I hate Bixby. Samsung please disable Bixby. The phone is a piece of glass. Buy the case before you buy the phone. Otherwise it's a great phone.
            "
"1101","I use this phone since it's in the market- it run speed and smooth- good camera- awesome screen - a lot of choices to unlock the screen the only one down sides is- place of the finger print
            "
"1102","phone is ok, relatively fast but bixby should be disabled
            "
"1103","It's not that great of a phone. It doesn't come in white. It's curved on the edges so finding a screen protector that doesn't collect lint on the edges under the protector. I can't wait to trade it in later it sucks.
            "
"1104","Great phone with a stunning edge to edge display that allows users to immerse themselves in video and gaming content. Although being an iOS user it was difficult to have apps from android not match the extent of options I am used to. The only other issue is if you have hands that can not reach the finger print sensor. But, all in all a great phone if you are able to move to the android ecosystem. Probably the best android phones out there!

"1105","previously used or refurbished.  this is not a brand new phone
            "
"1106","I have not even used the phone.  It was taken out the box to install.  It was dropped on the floor during the process.  It is shattered on all corners and cracks all the way across the front and back of the phone.
            "
"1107","I am completely happy with my purchase and recommend this Amazon Supplier!  I would purchase from this company again!Thanks so much!Mike
            "
"1108","Highly recommend! Prompt delivery and everything is within our expectation!
            "
"1109","The Bixby button is a hassle.  It can't be changed to another function.  What a waste.
            "
"1110","I love this phone. Although it is fragile and expensive, but it is worth the price, design and style. I would recommend this to anyone.
            "
"1111","It's great, gotta get usr yo having no home button but it's great
            "
"1112","I got this phone through Verizon and for the most part it's not bad but the bixby BS is so annoying. I'm constantly pushing the button pulling it out of my pocket and launching an app that I have no use for.
            "
"1113","Worst phone i have ever owned. Either the battery went bad or the charging circuit/battery calibration failed right after the warranty expired. Terrible customer service and they would not stand behind their product. Over-priced junk! Remember, these phones are only as good as their battery and ALL batteries fail after a certain amount of charge cycles. Again, over-priced junk!

"1114","...DO NOT GET THIS PHONE UNTIL SAMSUNG FIXES THE RESTART PROBLEM...On my 2nd S8+ which has the same restart problem as the first one.  I am locked out of my phone now. ill go back to Sprint see what they want to do next.  SAMSUNG cannot afford to have this kind of problem after the Note 7 mess. still no word from Samsung about this problem. there are hundreds of people with this problem. I spend 4+ hours in there developer blog stuff and no one has a fix for this. it restarts with SD card in or out, have done hard boot. took out all apps I could. nothing works. been to Samsung's web site tried almost everything there nothing works. About every 30 minutes phone will restart...Update phone problem seems to have gone away. It took a lot of hours to do. Not sure what was cause but not AS card. Sprint store in Chubbuck, Idaho did everything and some but phone works great now..Low this phone but I will be getting Note 8 when it comes out. This thinner phone which has 18 by 9 screen size fits your hand great. Not thrilled with the finger print placement but I don't use it. Beautiful screen, fast charge 47 minutes from 4% to 99%. Extremely fast prossesor.  Games work perfect. Not real happy with the 1 speaker at bottom of phone, but it is loud enough. Need speakers like Motorola X series. Stereo front facing. Overall now happy with my phone. Will update next month. 6/21/17..will give 4.5 stars because USB C on this phone does not work with USB C headphones.

"1115","GREAT looking phone!
            "
"1116","I love to getting on YouTube and I would love to have this product
            "
"1117","My faith in Samsung is going down the drain. We've used Samsung forever. But when my hubby's s8 plus screen cracks when it falls in the couch, and my s8 plus screen cracked because the tip of my hairspray bottle barely landed on it, you gotta wonder.  Why such fragile phones.  And no warranty to cover such incidents. Not like we dropped them on the ground.
            "
"1118","Absolutely gorgeous phone and display. Gorilla glass screen being indestructible is a joke. It's the most fragile smartphone I've ever owned. Extremelt disappointed with all aspects of Samsung customer servive.
            "
"1119","Forced Bixby app always pops up and is hardwired to button.  UnAmerican, unethical, and uncivilized to force consumer decisions and behaviors.  Removal apps by third parties force disabling security features so that is not an option.  My only real decision I still have is to return it for a non-Samsung device.  No more Samsung.
            "
"1120","Before you buy this phone, read reviews on the durability of the screen. There is no question whether or not you will break your screen. It WILL break. My screen broke after 2 weeks with both a screen protector and case on the phone. The S8 has the most fragile screen of any smartphone EVER. Don't believe me? Google it. Do not purchase this phone. Samsung tried to make up for their last failure and just made something equally terrible. There is no way that this screen is made of Gorilla Glass. My LG screen never broke, and I dropped it off of a 10 foot ladder onto concrete. Samsung is a joke. Stay away.
