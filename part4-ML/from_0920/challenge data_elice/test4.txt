50002,Argentina,"Norton Reserva is one of Argentina's best Cabernetss for the money. This vintage offers a mineral aroma along with rose petal, baked plum and spiced cherry scents. It feels deep, generous and balanced, with cassis, blackberry, earth and molasses flavors.",Reserva,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Michael Schachner,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Norton,,
50003,Spain,"With a nose of toffee, dried apricot, cocoa powder and rancio, this is classic off-dry amontillado. It feels fresh and active, then tastes rich and moderately sweet, with flavors of hazelnut, caramel, toasted banana, orange and spice. Nutty and smooth on the finish.",Amontillado,Andalucia,Jerez,,Michael Schachner,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.,,
50004,Italy,"A bit funky, the nose shows notes that suggest animal, farmyard and leather along with aromas of overripe black berries. The fruit has already dried up on the palate however, leaving green coffee bean sensations and astringent tannins that generate a drying, bitter finish. The second bottle was exactly the same.",,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Kerin O?�?Keefe,Sangiovese,Valdicava,,

50009,US,"Plum, dark chocolate, blackberry jam and licorice flavors star in this ambitious Cabernet. It's soft and appealing, but a little too one-dimensional, and it's hard to see it aging.",Saunders Vineyard Reserve,California,Carmel Valley,Central Coast,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bo??t??,,
50010,US,"High alcohol gives the wine heat, especially in the finish. It's also overripe, with the blackberries veering into port-like raisins and prunes.

50015,US,"A lightly aromatic wine with notes of peach, melon, and toasted grapenuts. It drinks off dry, but lacks the stitching to hold it all together.",,Idaho,,,Sean P. Sullivan,Viognier,Colter's Creek,,
50016,Spain,"Despite having mildly cheesy, oily aromas, this ranks as a perfectly quaffable everyday white, with modest acidity and a round, easygoing attitude. Flavors of peach and melon finish a touch mealy.",Edicion Limitada,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Michael Schachner,Viura,Maximo,,
50017,US,"A pretty coppery color reminiscent of the ros??s of southern France, this unusual blend of Mourv??dre, Syrah, Malbec and Viognier is done via the saign??e (bleeding the tanks) method.

50021,Italy,"This single-vineyard offering opens with aromas of very mature?�?nearly overripe?�?black fruit and tilled soil.

50022,US,"Crimson is half Merlot, one-third Cab Franc, the rest a mix of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon.

The midpalate drops out.",Crimson,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Paul Gregutt,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Merry Cellars,,
50023,Spain,"Scratchy red-berry aromas are herbal but not fully green. This has a lively, raw, choppy mouthfeel and flavors of herbal red berry and thyme.
