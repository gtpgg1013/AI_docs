"1","The US Warranty listed is not valid.  When I received my phone, I tried to register it on the Samsung website and received the error message: ""Possible reasons for the error include serial/IMEI number is not valid, product is older than 3 years, product was purchased outside the U.S.""Contacted Amazon, and a replacement phone was sent out.  When I attempted to register it, I had the same problem.  After spending an hour with Samsung customer service per the number in the warranty listing, the phone does NOT have a US Warranty available.

"2","I bought this in September of 2017 and absolutely loved it. Then they pushed an update for Oreo about 6 months ago which caused the phone to no longer allow Bluetooth control of streaming services through my vehicles head unit. I waited for a fix. I looked online, and tried everything from factory resets to changing developer mode settings, updating the firmware on the head unit, contacting Pandora's tech support. Samsung's solution is for me to send it (my only active phone) in, and wait a week or two with no phone so they can send me a refurbished one... with no guarantee that it will fix the issue. Yep, I send them a phone that was purchased new, go without a phone for two weeks, and then they'll send me back a 'refurbished' phone potentially with a scratched up screen and poor battery, that will likely not fix the issue since it is clearly a software problem. I used to swear by Samsung, but I can no longer recommend Samsung to anyone based on my S8 not working properly for 2/3 of the time I've owned it. I currently own the following Samsung devices, Galaxy S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, Gear, Gear S Nano, Samsung Refrigerator, and a Curved 4k TV. I say this so you know how much I have enjoyed Samsung in the past. If they release an update that breaks something, their expectation is that you'll just go buy a new one - I've given them 6 months to fix what they broke in the Oreo update and they haven't done it... they haven't had any trouble though pushing their new phone. No thanks. Now as items stop working I will make sure to avoid Samsung.

"3","The Samsung Galaxy S8 I was shipped had model number SM-G950F, which is the international version of the phone, not the US version as specified in this item.I recently got lines of dead pixels in my S8 and Samsung refuses to pay for it because the international version of the phone does not have a warranty coverage as promised in this item.

"4","I was skeptical about buying this phone off Amazon instead of Verizon because the reviews were half good, half bad as far as activating it on the Verizon network.  My advice is dont go to the store and activate yourself on their website.  It takes just 5-10 minutes.  Just make sure to have a Verizon nano SIM card, I was able to use the one from my iphone 6.  Transfer your contacts, music etc on their app as well, it's very easy.  Other than that the actual phone is great.  Very sleek looking phone.  This phone is $756 at Verizon and they try to sell their payment plan to you but I would much rather pay the cheaper Amazon price and keep my phone bill lower.  If you're on the fence like I was I hope this review can help you out.

"5","This review is coming from a long time Apple user. After years of drink the koolaid I decided to make a change.Upgrading from the Apple ecosystem isn't easy as it is a big change but this phone is incredible. It may not be a 2018 flagship but it is still great.CAMERA: the 12 megapixel camera is clear and bright. It does not take the best low light pictures but as good if not better than other flagship of 2017. In daylight this camera shines and is excellent.SCREEN: Samsung has a always had the best quality smartphone screens. The infinity display is something to get used to but the super sampled display is no different. The colors are bright and vibrant. When the display is set to 1440p (factory defaults the display to 1080p) is crystal clear and watching videos or photos it will blow your mind if you compare it to comparable smartphones.DESIGN: The infinity display and glad back are a very elegant design, while allowing for great features and one not so great.FEATURES: This phone most of the features of 2018 flagships. Fingerprint scanner, face unlock and iris scanner. The only thing is the placement of the fingerprint scanner is in less than a desirable location. Being right next to the camera lens it is very easy to smudge it when reaching for it, but the face unlock is very reliable and extremely fast so you have options.Due to the glass back the s8 has wireless charging alongside Samsung's fast charging system allows for easy and fast charging anywhere.HARDWARE: The snapdragon 835 with gigs of ram may not be the latest and greatest but for multitasking and everyday tasks are seemless. Gaming is also fast and smooth. It's no razor phone or note 9 but it is more than capable.All in all this is  great smartphone and is defintly worth your consideration if you can't stomach 1000$ for a phone.
            "
"6","Just after my support ended, my screen seems to have begun having a hardware issue. Horizontal lines have begun appearing, and it looks to be a hardware issue. Pretty disappointed that the Amazon support does not last longer considering I've seen multiple posts online about this being an issue. I haven't had any drops or water issues with the phone, so it looks like the AMOLED screens become defective after a certain time potentially.  Note that if you contact Samsung about this, they will require you to send your phone back, which can be a problem if you do not have another phone to use during that time. Buyer beware!
            "
"7","I am honestly astounded by how beautiful and advance this phone is. Coming from an iPhone 6s, this is truly an upgrade worth getting for the price.Firstly, the screen is absolutely the best you can get on the market on any phone right now. It has a beautiful 5.8"" Quad HD+ Super AMOLED (2960x1440 resolution). This makes the colors, contrast, and blacks more vivid and pure.  The pure black is pixels turned off when they aren't needed. This gives an amazing black color and helps a bit with the battery not needing to display extra pixels. The screen also employs Samsung's ""Infinity Display"". This creates a nearly bezel-less design on the front screen which gives can provide more information on the screen. They have removed their physical buttons, but it's really noticeable after a few minutes. A feature that I have come to use quite a bit (with widgets and fast opening of certain apps) is the Edge. I am very glad they've introduced the Edge screen onto the regular S series. If you don't prefer it, you can also turn it off. Samsung has also added an Always On Display. This shows the date and time along with notifications you receive. This doesn't consume hardly any battery life (with only losing around 1% an hour)Software: Out of the box, it runs Android 7.0 (Nougat). It also does come with Samsung's 'controversial' TouchWiz skin. However, they've greatly improved the experience and fluidity of the software. I have not noticed any lag with using it for some time now. It's responsive and I personally enjoy the look of it. You can always download different launchers to your liking. S8 users should be able to get Andriod 8.0 (Oreo) within early next month.Hardware: this phone sports 64gb (along with MicroSD slot of up to 256gb of expandable storage) and 4gb of RAM. I am really happy with the amount of RAM and space that's offered. With my iPhone, I've always had to load up the pages I was on again due to the low RAM, along with the very disappointing 16gb of Space (12gb in usable). This limited to using my old phone for daily news and chat apps, while hardly being able to play many games. This is definitely not an issue with the S8! I've downloaded many things that I previously couldn't and I still have a beast amount of storage left. It's also IP68 certified dust and water resistant.Charging: I love the Adaptive Fast Charge that Samsung offers for their products. It charges my phone quickly without it getting hot. The battery capacity is 3000mAh and fast for hours. I can go around 4-6 hours of Screen On Time while going around 12 hours in general. I am very happy with this as regular charging seems quite dated to have it on any (premium) phone.Camera: This Camera is truly beautiful and very detailed. I am surprised by how much I am using it. The photos are clear and crisp all with just one snap. Selfies are also detailed and great to look at. 8MP AF for Front and Dual Pixel 12MP AF for the Rear.Security: The S8 employs two different biometrics for unlocking your phone (along with the regular number/line password). The one we've known for some time is the fingerprint scanner (to which they have moved it right next to the camera. This is not a preferable location as I do hit the Camera often) and the new Iris scanner. The Iris scanner has been quite convenient, though you do have to be a bit close (and in light) for it to work.Voice Command: Samsung has added a new 'Bixby' to their phone line that is to be used similarly to Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Google's Assistant. There is a dedicated button on the left side of the phone that allows for Bixby to hear your voice for your questions/command. This button will also open Bixby home, which shows some news, events, personal widgets, and Bixby 'levels'. That is right, you can increase the levels gained on Bixby by using it and helping it with feedback. This doesn't lock you behind any level requirements to use it to the full. This only allows customization unlocks. This has been a controversial feature so far (as many find it unnecessary), though I have been fairly enjoying it. I really use it for screenshots. If you don't prefer it, there are apps to redirect the Bixby button to use it for other apps.Overall, the experience is astounding and I wouldn't trade it for anything else really. This is a phone that will feel premium for years to come. If you're holding out, don't wait! It's an experience unlike any other.NOTE: I have covered the broad specs of the S8, however there are also smaller details that you can view on Samsung's homepage if you want all the specs and information.

"9","I did buy this phone NEW and FROM Amazon just FYINow I know the quality of the product has nothing to do with Amazon so this rating is obviously for the product specifically.I even noticed that someone had the same problem with the phone that I did.It completely died after owning it for about 3 months. I did not do anything to the phone other than add a micro SD card (which is allowed with this device) and it worked fine ever since I bought it.However Amazons warranty is not so great. Samsung does offer a 1 year manufacturers warranty on NEW items. The CSR (Customer Support Representative) was helpful and straight forward. You do have to ship the phone to them, but they will email you a paid for shipping label (Print 3 to place on 3 sides of the box). Excluding the shipping time, maintenance and processing will take 9-11 business days. Obviously no one should have to deal with this in the first place, but I just want a helpful review if someone has a bad situation happen to them like I did. Samsung's CSR is 866-371-9501. Follow the menu prompts and you will get the option to speak to a CSR (it can get annoying waiting through all the options but you'll get there)

"10","In less than 8 months, the call volume on this phone no longer works.  After numerous hours on the phone and at an authorized service center, it was determined that it is a manufacturers defect.  Customer support from Samsung was not helpful.  I have to send the phone back to Samsung to be repaired; and although the phone is under warranty Samsung support refused to provide a loaner and told me I have to wait 2 weeks for the phone to be repaired.
            "
"11","Read my review before make your decision!!!!!!!!!I have purchased the S8 from this seller for around 5 months only. I have never dropped the device, never done any physical damage to the device, never done anything to the operating system. Then when I was using the cellphone for fun, suddenly it shows an problem: Device Storage Corrupted.Therefore, considering this device is still under US one-year warranty, as the seller states in the product description, I contacted Samsung service and sent the S8 to repair. However, Samsung repair center told me that the motherboard of this device is replaced, therefore, it is out of warranty... I am not sure if the seller has an explanation on this?If not, I can only suspect that the seller has done something to the device. Then Do not buy anything from the seller! It will not be under the warranty if there is any problem!!! The Samsung would say it is not from official sellers, they won't be responsible for it!!!
            "
"12","The good: I'm really glad that I got this over spending more for a Verizon phone. There's less garbage on it from the carrier (and the few things that it tried to install when I inserted the SIM card were able to be uninstalled). The battery life is pretty crazy. Even without the power saver mode turned on, it lasts all day. Switch on power saver mode and it won't use hardly any power unless the screen is turned on. The curved screen doesn't cause issues with the touch screen while using it one-handed, and is positively gorgeous. People actually ask me what phone I have. The camera is super fast and takes amazing pictures.The bad: Bixby is not what it's cracked up to be in my opinion. Sure it can do some cool stuff, but 90% of the time it's not helpful. Additionally, there's a really quick, perceptible wait for the microphone to turn on when you hold the button down. I also tend to push the button (or it gets pushed as it's going into my pocket) on accident. For some reason when I type the microphone key on the keyboard to do voice dictation, it refuses to use the Google voice recognition engine. It's not really slick so it won't fall out of your hand, but when I put it screen down on my nightstand, there's some coating or something on the screen that will actually let the phone slowly slide around (because the table isn't 100% level).

"13","This is for the model SM-G950 and SOLD and FULFILLED by AMAZON.*I bought this phone from Amazon directly, so beware of other negative reviews from other shops*So far I love this phone. When it arrived it was clearly brand new in the box, never been touched. It also came with Samsung headphones inside the box, even though the option I selected was 'phone only'.  It is lightning fast and the camera is incredible!  It was an easy transition from my old Galaxy S5. I am with Tmobile and had to go get a micro-sim activated for this phone. Never had an issue in compatibility with T-Mobile and my overall service coverage actually improved. There is a minimal amount of pre-installed apps which is nice as it won't slow the phone down with unnecessary bloatware.  Completely satisfied with my purchase and will update if anything changes.
            "
"14","Great phone! Good touchscreen response. Great camera, ect, etc. Would have been perfect if they had packaged the right one. I don't live in freaking Europe. Samsung fail, not Amazon. The box listed the model as SM-G950U1 (USA version). Inside, factory sealed, was SM-G950F (international version). The IMEI number even matched. How could this error possibly happen?!? It cost me half a day dealing with Verizon trying to figure out what the problem was.Pissed
            "
"15","This phone was rated as ""good"" from warehouse deals. When it arrived it was in the factory box and looked like it had never been opened.  The plastic was still on the screen. I found no scratches or imperfections. My carrier is Sprint. It is truly unlocked for all carriers.They had me hooked up in about 15 minutes. The clerk asked me if i had bought the phone new from Samsung directly. He told me it was the unlocked version that would work internationally too.I have had the phone a couple of weeks and it has performed flawlessly. This was another great buy for me here on Amazon. If you are on the fence like I was about upgrading to the S8, go ahead and buy one here, its just an awesome phone. I had an S5 that was great but this S8 is so much better. Trust me on this. Go ahead and buy it. You will be amazed too!
            "
"16","It's a Samsung so I live it. I got this to replace my S7 that was terrible,and battery life as super low.I was thinking about getting the S9 with Sprint,but their prices are insane and the S9 has not much difference from the S8 other the finger print scanner button, new processor and new camera. It is not worth the price and the monthly payment to the carrier. I decided to get a unlocked S8 and not own them a penny what's great. It works with Sprint just fine, I highly recommend you to buy your own phone than deal with these carrier financing scam.

"17","I bought two cellphones, my wife cellphone is still working great. But my cellphone had a software problem since the beginning, everytime I tried to update the software it showed an error. Last week I installed Samsung Smart Switch on my PC to back up my files, it showed me the option that I could update the software through this app, but after a while it just took me to a blue screen, now my cellphone is useless, it doesnt accept the emergency software recovery or any other option. I will try to get the warranty.
            "
"18","I love the look and functionality of this phone. It's got plenty of internal storage and a slot for my memory chip. I'm not thrilled with the charging port, all my micro USB chargers are now useless, and the battery life is not amazing. My old phone, a cheap Samsung J3, had a 12 hour battery life. Usually, far longer. Even so, I love this phone and it did come with an attachment to convert one of my micro USB car chargers into a compatible charger, so... Ultimately, a great purchase. I'll just have to charge it on long work days.
            "
"19","Was supposed to be unlocked and compatible with cellular/data programs offered by, among other major providers, Verizon.  Well, it wasn't.  Finally took it to a Verizon store and was told that the phone was simply not compatible with Verizon. So Frustrating! It's so obvious the answer is the best course of action is to go to a provider brick and mortar store (in this case Verizon), and buy the phone there.  Whatever the difference in price is, if any, is more than offset by the time and hassle saved. Ugh!

"20","Ive loved all my samsung phones EXCEPT THIS ONE.  It freezes up (software issue) and gets super hot.  SO EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TO REPLACE GLASS.. its becaus they can charge alot.  iphone was $80.. my s8 over $300!!

"21","Im very disappointed with my purchase, i purchase this phone in August and the phone no longer turns on as of November 27 this year.
            "
"22","I read the reviews and I needed a waterproof phone.  I've only had this for a few days so far and still getting used to why it makes noises at different times.  It told me ""it appears you go to bed around 0030, do you want to enter in plans for tomorrow now?""  or something to that effect at 6pm today.  That is a little creepy to me.  These are supposed to be phones, communication devices not creeper tracking you.I truly believe the prices for these ""smartphones"" are between insane and stupid (over $500 for this one and IPHONES run close enough to $1000), but times are a changing and we all ""need"" to stay connected with these little devices.The camera works really well on this phone as it takes nice, sharp photos.  It was a bit of a challenge to transfer my contacts from a non Samsung phone to this one.  Just export your contacts to a micro SD card from your old phone and put in the new S8.  It only took a short time to bring all the info over to the new phone.
            "
"23","At first I was thinking ""Am I nuts for spending 600 bucks on a phone?"" Well sanity not withstanding, I am happy with my new phone.I use it with my Tracfone account. So it is cheap for me to maintain for the year. It's nice not having a phone that is locked to any specific carrier.And the functionality of the S8 is great. I like the biometric features. The DEX functionality is a bonus. I didn't even know about it at the time I bought it. The built in device maintenance means I don't have to run an app that bombards me with ads just to clean the phones OS.The bad.Samsung Bixby. I don't have a problem with everyone trying to come up with their own digital assistant software. But it should be optional not forced. In order to disable it on the phone, first you have to agree with the license. Not happy about having to agree to let someone in my house in order to be able to tell them to get out.Samsung Pay. No you cannot hold my wallet.Samsung Health. Stop shoving advertising in my face.But other than that, I love the phone.
            "
"24","There is a lot I love about this phone but a handful of things I'm not crazy about. Picture quality, sound quality, storage, all of those are great. The Bixby button sucks. The location of the button is TERRIBLE and I'm constantly hitting it on accident and having Bixby take over my screen. I dont use Bixby, I can't figure out how to turn the option off (of that's even possible). Another thing I dont care for is how easy it is to move apps and folders around on the screen. It seems like at least once a week I look at my phone and some apps/folders are in a different place I have no idea when it happened. Lastly, I switched to this phone from an iPhone 5, and it seems like my cell service (which didnt change) is WAY worse. Lots of calls going straight to voicemail without my phone ever ringing. I never had that issue on iPhone. Overall I'm very pleased. The battery life is amazing (kicks the iPhone's booty for sure), memory space is amazing (again, kicking booty). I wouldnt go back

"25","This phone is dope, it looks cool and it feels cool. Some people dont like where the finger print scanner is located but I dont really mind, I got used to it in a day but thats just me. This is one of the best phones I've had, its really fast and you can customize everything!One thing I would like to point out, wich I havent seen any other reviewer talk about, is that when I put my SIM card inside the S8 it dint activate my LTE service, so this is what I did, grab another phone that has a SIM card from your same carrier and copy that phones VPN setting to your S8, it worked for me.Id recomend buying a case if you are prone to droping phones like am, but I have a friend that has had her S8+ for 5 months without a case and has not droped it once, but i wouldnt take that chance.Edit: I added some pictures of what I did with the VPN, you just have to manually copy the information from another cell phone to your S8, hope this helps.Ps.My friend dropped her phone a few days ago lol, buy a case.

"26","Great phone, first unlocked we've ever bought, and it was a great move.  It's great but not perfect.PROSExcellent performance with all apps, very snappyBeautiful screen (though very delicate)Light, great battery lifeCONS* Phone is slippery wherever you touch/grab it.  Hard to hold onto, unless you get a case, which you probably should.* Bixby assistant is very obtrusive and even has its own dedicated hard button on the left, which you will be mistakenly hitting often (you can sign into Samsung and set the button to do nothing, but you can't seem to reassign the button to be useful, or completely get rid of Bixby).* Edge screen design is a novelty and more difficult to use than a standard screen.  I find myself having to try multiple times to get the right thing selected with my finger, because of the wrapping edges of the screen* Doesn't seem to have a widget for flashlight built in, like my S5 had

"27","phone won't call or text even though it says it is connected. Try over and over then in an hour or so it will work.the window for returns is way to short for something that costs $500.

            "
"28","I really like this phone, upgraded from a comparatively ancient Note 2 and got it last week. The battery life lasts me a bit under two days using it normally with the ""always on"" screen feature, but there are some fancy-looking power saving modes that reduce some of the phone's functionality for significantly longer battery life. I haven't tested them yet though because it hasn't been necessary. I'm sad to see the S Pen go, it wasn't worth spending another $350 for the Note 8, but I'm impressed by how much smoother the screen looks and feels. The camera is also pretty reasonable. Low-light situations are pretty questionable, but for a phone it seems to do a decent job. The camera fares much better in bright indoor lights and outside.The S8 feels pretty light and a bit slick due to how much glass is used in its construction. It's a nice-looking phone, but after having dropped my old one and living with a cracked screen for two years, I took zero chances and put it in an Otterbox Defender case almost immediately.The software is also quite nice. There's no carrier bloatware on it so you don't have to spend half an hour trying to uninstall and disable apps that you'll never use, but it still comes with most of the basic apps you'll need. Samsung clearly put in a lot of effort on the overall aesthetics of the interface too. Overall no complaints.My carrier is Verizon and it was relatively painless to get the phone set up with them. I just went to one of their locations (not a third-party retailer) and they gave me a SIM card for free. I was alone during this so they texted a code to my parents and I called them via a landline phone at the store so they could read it me, and after punching that into the terminal the Verizon employee took care of the rest. I recommend using Google or Verizon's cloud backup or some other software (like Samsung Kies) to get your contacts BEFORE getting the new phone. I forgot to do that so I walked around for two days getting texts from disembodied numbers until I worked it out on my own. Set up backups NOW, my old phone's screen was completely broken (hence the new phone) and the only reason I was able to get my contacts off of it was because the S Pen digitizer was still functioning (but nothing else) so I could blindly punch in my PIN to unlock the phone.

"29","I was a Apple User for the longest time and i decided to try a Samsung product. I loved the phone, I thought the phone functioned a lot better then any IPhone i had. After about a month of no issues at all, the phone just stopped working. I never dropped the phone or anything, just out of the blue it stopped working. I went and bought 4 different charges (about $100 in chargers) to find out none of the chargers worked to turn the phone on. Luckily, Samsung was very upfront about solving the issue with my phone. Since i bought the phone only a month ago, the phone does have a warranty. I haven't received my new phone yet so still to be determined how they handle the warranty. Assuming they send another one and everything is smooth then ill be a customer again in the future.Overall good phone, just make sure to take care of it assuming it breaks on you. Just to make sure they honor the warranty.

"30","I purchased my phone mid 2017 . Had fast shipping and product looked to be legit . No issues for the 6-8 months , Until the keyboard  started to burn into the screen.

Well this is why not.BUY FROM AN AUTHORIZED DEALER!!!

"31","An all around good phone, with a fast, clean, and well thought out user interface.  A literal life saver, as it ""secret serviced"" a .45 hollow point meant for my femur...I'll elaborate.While I was at the shooting range there was a negligent discharge and the round impacted my left thigh.  Fortunately, I kept my Galaxy S8 in my front left pocket, and it took the round for me.  The bullet went trough the case smashed the back of the phone dented and deformed some metal plate in the phone and then deflected out of the back of the case and came to rest in the bottom of my pants pocket.I'd post pictures but, well, the S8 didn't make it.  I've been using Samsung phones for a few years now with no issues, and now that one has saved my life (probably) I am likely to keep using them.

"32","Bought this to use as part of my Verizon account.  Obtained a sim card from the Verizon store and they activated it successfully.  This is an AT&T Phone and comes with an AT&T sim card.  It does work on the Verizon network but the AT&T logo is all over it including the built-in AT&T apps.  The built-in apps can be disabled but not deleted.  The time did not want to sync but that may change with updates.  I gave it 4 stars because they could be more up-front that it is AT&T.  The Galaxy S8 is a great phone.  So far, it is worth the $400 savings over getting it from Verizon.  Only time will tell.
            "
"33","Phone works great on Verizon even though the box etc had the AT&T logo all over it.  Strange thing was that I ordered an S8 a couple months ago from the same amazon web link and got a Verizon phone which is what I wanted.  So my wife liked my phone and I simply used the link from my previous amazon order and low and behold I get this AT&T one.  Took this new S8 to the Verizon store and they did their magic and loaded all my wifes contacts/apps/etc from her old phone to this AT&T one and everything works fine.  Strange thing is that both phones were ordered from the same Amazon link but were fulfilled by different suppliers.  The Verizon phone came from JTS Wireless and the AT&T phone came from Levy Commerce.  I should also say that both phones were definitely NEW phones, not rebuilt, even though the Amazon website did not explicitly say NEW.  I did post a question and was answered that I was purchasing a NEW phone.

"34","Phone is nice but doesnt support WIFI calling which is an extremly important feature for me. I assumed it would since it was backed by Samsung and such a newer phone but it does not. I didnt realize this until I argued with my carrier about poor service for a few months and discovered it waa the phone not being able to use WIFI calling in the areas i had less coverage, by that time i was told it was to late for any refunds or exchanges and they made the suggestion i try to sell the phone to someone who doesnt need WIFI calling...

"35","I went from a bootloop ridden LG-g4 to a cheap $50~ phone with a cracked screen/bad mic/speaker for almost 2 years, it didn't really bother me much until I started working and going to college, that's when I started getting lots of calls. So my cheap ass finally decided to get a new phone. After some research, the s8 was the only thing in the 450-500 price range that was was this amazing so I bought it as soon as it was in stock. And I do not regret it for a single moment of the day. This phone has mostly everything I didn't have on my old phone, an amazing screen, water resistant, faster processor, great software, and a good camera. Most of the apps Samsung has are actually useful or at least decent, too bad my cell company forced me to install a bunch of bad apps. The only con I have for this phone is that it doesn't have a ridiculously long battery life compared to my cheap phone, but the tradeoff is the screen/process power of course. Anyways, great phone for the price I guarantee you won't regret it.

"36","Oh yeah! Few things I have emotional response to when pleased, but this phone, I love him! The wrap around edge beautiful. Hi def screen. Options in depth.I'm getting to like Bixby too. It's helping open controller I can't find, look up things on the web, dial, message, calculate, set timer, define. Still exploring that feature.Fingerprint unlocks quickly. The complaints about location next to camera, I guess I got used to it faster than the average monkey! Since I use the phone in a holder in the car, I added a 3rd print, for when I reach over the phone in the holder, right index finger upside down.Iris recognition, cumbersome.  But when fingers are wet or in gloves, print reader fails. So iris scanner helps.Using for music and internet radio at the gym with belt holder and Bluetooth earphones. Nice custom sound setting for the headset, rich!Way way better than my S5.Like the feature that if stolen and they reset the phone, it will not work without my unlock info! So don't even Try to steal it!

"37","I bought this phone supposedly new from Amazon. When it arrived, everything worked okay except for two major issues:The phone refused to perform software updates over mobile data, despite having proper settingsThe phone microphone does not work at all. Phone calls and other tasks which require the microphone render the unit useless unless a headset is connected. Amazon support was unhelpful, and Samsung support is also useless. This is the second phone I have purchased from them. The first was sent back because the screen stopped responding to touch input. I would not buy a another ""new"" phone from them.
            "
"38","OK, I'm a mediocre tech, so this phone will do a million things I'll never ask of it, I'm sure. I'll leave the reviews of the actual S8 to those who can do it justice. I will keep my comments to the method of purchase, since if you're like me, you worry that the price here is so much less than at ATT. So, let me just say that the phone arrived in what appeared to be pristinely new packaging. Because my previous phone was an S5 I had to go to ATT for a new SIM card (nano vs micro). Anyway, they didn't charge me for the SIM. I haven't gotten a bill, so I don't know whether I'll have an activation charge, but that would be the case no matter where you purchase. After charging up the phone I started all the opening, transferring, updating. That took an hour or so I think. After that I could text and connect with ease. But, incoming phone calls were so horrible I was just sure I'd screwed up. Online research led me to rebooting the phone and that immediately cleared everything up. All of the startup had apparently set something off. So, I'm VERY pleased with my purchase. I saved over $250 by buying it through the Amazon link as opposed to the ATT plan!!!.
            "
"39","Hardware is top notch. The phone is impressively powerful and the beautiful screen makes using it a joy. Music fans will love the SD card support and 3.5mm jack. (Yes, it's still able to store your old massive collection of MP3s AND you can enjoy it with your expensive wired headphones!)Battery lasts the day (unless you're in a cell deadspot) and will get you through the night if you do a rapid top up around noon.The unit is mostly waterproof and will survive in the rain or shower (both tested) but it won't be much use under water and probably won't survive anything much deeper than a bathtub.Software might not be to everyone's liking but it's the usual Android system underneath so you can change it however you like.Only real downside is that it's so pleasant to use I don't use my expensive PC much anymore.
            "
"40","I read the good, the bad, the ugly reviews and took my chances. 2-day shipping, little scratches on the box but at least the phone was in there. I activated the new T-Mobile sim card with my existing account and all my data from my old galaxy phone got transferred smoothly. The phone has a great sleek modern look and feel, no problems with it.

"41","The phone I received from this Amazon seller is an unlocked Verizon phone.  It may or may not have been ""unlocked by Samsung"", but that claim is certainly misleading as it leads you to believe that you are receiving a generic universal phone.  Verizon is CDMA, the other more common carriers are GSM and they are not compatible, though some phones offer some of the frequencies of both types.  When I put my AT&T sim card in it, it seemed to work, but the display came up with a Verizon welcome page and there was an annoying ""not a Verizon sim card"" error message in the notification tray.  You could force the error to go away, but it always came back when you powered up the phone.  I did not trust that I would get true GSM performance out of a Verizon phone and might experience slow or degraded performance due to a shortage of available frequencies so I returned the phone and ordered a true unlocked generic phone directly from Samsung.  It cost more but the peace of mind is worth it.  For over $700 including tax you shouldn't have to put up with nuisance messages in your new phone, potentially degraded performance or deceptive advertising.1/11/2018 -  Received my new phone that I ordered from directly from Samsung today.  It is a true generic phone without any carrier software installed and very streamlined.  Now that I have seen what a new phone should look like I can also add to my original review that the phone I received from ""Electronic Deals"" via Amazon was NOT a new phone, or had at least been previously opened because it was missing a few of the accessories were included with the phone I received today and it also had fingerprints all over it. I recommend paying the extra $75 and getting a truly new phone that is universal directly from the Samsung store.

"42","SO I ordered the Samsung galaxy s8 unlocked 64GB-US model  G950U midnight black US warranty. Used in good conditions retailed for $519.00 plus tax . It shipped Amazon prime and it arrived via Fedex. Presentation and packaging was nice I expected a crappy box but it came in a nicely detailed android smartphone device box.  So when I turned on the phone I was worried because it had a Verizon smart up menu and when we inserted our metro pcs sim card it read "" not a verizon sim card"" anyways so I went to Metro pcs decided to get a new sim card because mines was old anyways and then they asked if the galaxy s8 phone was unlocked I said yes, the guy was kinda rude and said some features are not going to work properly it seems like no carrier wants to activate unlocked phones these days anyways he set it up. I got home and checked my main features I use like, casting to tv, wifi, browser & youtube sharing, messaging, messaging sharing, bluetooth, wireless charging, sharing, phone calls, google chrome, google home everything worked perfectly so maybe its just the feautures offered from the Verizon network.
            "
"43","The S8 is a great phone. I got this for my girlfriend for her birthday and I was worried it would be annoying to get activated on her Verizon account. I was completely wrong: she took her sim card out of her iphone 6, put it in her new S8, let the phone finish its initial setup, and that was literally it. She didn't have to even log into her Verizon account and register anything, it just worked immediately (i.e. she could send texts and calls and use her 4g network when wifi was turned off). Very impressive.Pros:- instant setup without any hassle or contacting Verizon. Didn't need to contact or even login to Verizon (already had a sim card from another Verizon phone)- Fast, great screen, Android, great camera, expandable disk space, slim, gorgeous- Powerful enough to emulate ps1 games- Still has a dedicated headphone jackCons:- dedicated Bixby (virtual assistant that I don't care to learn) button that can only be disabled not reprogrammed- inserting sim and sd card works via a flimsy insert that pops out the top. Fortunately you only likely have to do this once or twice

"44","I've had a Samsungs since high school. It is just easier to use and I know how they work. I like the slickness, the volume, and the picture quality. I am a simple person and I don't generally find out everything that my new technology does but the Samsung has prompted me to do just about everything it could possibly do. Also, it being unlocked worked out. I thought it was going to be a hassle but I walked right into AT&T and they had my new phone and new service up and running within 30 minutes. Great buy in my opinion. Being a prime member was worth it in the end also because it arrived on Sunday as promised. The only thing the US post office service dropped this VERY expensive device at the door without knocking to let anyone know it was there! As opposed to UPs or FEDEX they don't bother to get you to sign. I would advice using one of the Amazon mailbox stations at the QT gas station or where ever they are closest to your location. Much safer.

"45","I'm typing the review on the phone right now so it would be rather difficult to take a picture of the product, but that being said. I'm very happy with the phone and only have minor complaints about it.The Good:Great and quality displayThe speakers are better than most phones from this particular generationI'm yet to have the phone crash or have any major problemsGreat INITIAL battery life (will come back to this)Camera quality is astounding even on lower settingsThe bad:The bixby button is a satan spawn and never should have been made into an actual button. ""Okay Google"" is far superior in basically every way.The battery life I've found has steadily declined in only a few months. It used to I could go almost a full day and a hald without charging. I purchased the phone I think in June and it's now December 31st, 2018 at the time of my review, and I have to charge 2-3 times a day usually with the same amount of use.Also did I mention the bixby button?Conclusion:All in all a great phone with a great interface and very user friendly as well as good durability with very few complaints about it
            "
"46","I bought the phone on November 2017.1. Two weeks of use and I started noticing a green line appears on the screen. When I searched, found that it is a common issue. I raised a request with Amazon and got the phone replaced.2. I always use a phone cover. Close to one year of usage, I removed the phone cover to clean the phone. Noticed that the phone back cover has cracks. I have never dropped the phone. Not sure how the cracks came. Again when I searched about it, looks like many people have the same issue.3. Now after 1 year and 2 months of use, the phone has completely stopped working. Keeps restarting and displays ""RAM dump by hard reset"". I can't get into boot mode or download mode to reset the phone. When I took to the Samsung customer care, they said it is out of warranty now and cannot be fixed. It seems that is a motherboard issue and they can't fix it.Total waste of 600$..
            "
"47","My phone arrived in great condition. I started it up, was happy with everything, until I took it in to have my SIM card put in.The phone is missing settings.The workers at the store literally couldn't figure out what was wrong with this phone. It's missing some vital network settings needed for them to transfer info. In addition to that, it got stuck in a SIM-card update cycle. So I couldn't transfer any info, and more importantly, I literally couldn't get it to work as an actual phone. The page claims to be AT&T compatible but that seems to be untrue - or the phone itself was just a dud. I can't seem to get a refund either way.Absolutely terrible experience, would give 0/5 stars if possible.
            "
"48","Arrived quickly, took to ATT for activation with absolutely no problem. I was in and out in less than 30 minutes including adding changes to my account. Phone is a nice size, display very clear. My only con is that the font sizes are not great and don't allow too much adjustment. With a bigger screen, this is harder to read texts on than my Galaxy 5. I will play with the screen zoom and fonts, may see if I can download one that works better for me. Overall it's very nice, and a definite upgrade. Glad I stayed with Galaxy.
            "
"49","Why didn't anyone tell me about the Samsung galaxy life! I....cuss word....LOVE this phone. Love love love! It is so sleek and beautiful  and smooth. The texting ease. The apps. I hardly know what to do with myself, I am overwhelmed by awesomeness. Listen to me. If you're like me and keep things in your cart for days and weeks at a time because of indeciveness, please believe me....this will be the one thing that is worth the fast click purchase. I'm so sorry I didn't get it sooner but I will never look back. #Samsung fer life!
            "
"50","This is a very fast and attractive phone. It is narrow enough to hold comfortably in your hand but still has a large screen. The camera takes sharp pictures and is quickly accessed from your lock screen. I like the edge menu and customized it to give me quicker access to apps I use most. Audio in all forms gets great playback quality. The speakerphone is loud and clear for video or voicemail playback and there is customization in the sound menu to tailor headphone audio to your hearing spectrum. Battery life is good, generally lasting anywhere from a day to a day and a half, and power saving mode is easily enabled if you're low. I effortlessly enrolled it in Samsung Premium Care, but I purchased directly from Amazon, a Samsung authorized retailer. The phone is not perfect. I don't find Bixby useful and am disappointed about the inability to reassign its dedicated button. The phone has a quality feel, but the all glass exterior made me wary to use it unprotected and I wrapped it in a case and screen protector immediately. The curvature on the screen edges also makes it difficult to find and install suitable screen protection. Overall, this phone does everything I want, it¡¯s unlocked so I don't have to root to cut carrier bloat (although there is some Samsung bloatware) and none of my complaints outweigh the things it does well.
            "
"51","The title of this phone states that it is an unlocked phone by Samsung and works on all networks and is a ""U.S."" version.  These are all lies.  The IMEI number was BLACKLISTED and even after calling Samsung they informed us it was NOT a ""U.S."" version but rather an international version which would not work....a complete waste of time and ruined what was going to be a Christmas present for a family member.
            "
"52","I will simply add to the ""I love it"" category but I do want to add something that might not be known. Samsung is a bit deceptive in their advertising of this phone. The infinity display is NOT really infinity. Notice they overexpose the edges on the image shown for this product. This is to hide the fact that the display does not really go from edge to edge. It goes over the curve slightly but there is a noticeable edge around the display. It is not technically an Infinity display. That's a bit of a letdown, but not a game changer for me in saying I still love the phone. Mostly because the camera is great and the battery is sick, that is awesome.
            "
"53","Had this phone for a couple months now and I thoroughly enjoy all the features especially the camera. The quality of the camera (which is important to me because I take a lot of pictures) is great and I like the sleek design. Be careful of the always on display. It can burn your screen.
            "
"54","I absolutely hate this phone. I have had this phone for 5 months now so i have had time to make an honest opinion. To start the convex screen does not make the image seem larger and is just cumbersome. I cant find a reasonably priced screen protector that works so I'm just chancing it without one. The touch sensitivity is set too high and is not at all friendly to anyone with large hands (like myself) and is not adjustable. It constantly is electing things in my fingers pathway when I'm trying to swipe the screen. The screen on/off button is placed directly opposite the Bixby button so I have to delicately use both hands to turn it off instead of calling the persistently useless Bixby. I cannot under any conditions manage to get Bixby to understand a single thing I say and I cannot disable Bixby. I absolutely hate Bixby more than anything else about this phone. It also has an annoying habit of losing the wifi signal while all my other devices work just fine. The only good thin about this phone is that it charges ridiculously fast and stays charged all day. That is the only reason I'm not giving it 1 star.
            "
"55","The phone came in it's original box. At first glance it looked like everything was in order but upon further inspection the booklet was nowhere to be found. The headphones included weren't the usual Samsung brand ones but AKG ones. I found the sound quality of said ear pieces to be subpar to the Samsung ones, not to mention that one of the covers that held the logo of the brand AKG came loose after 3 days of use. Next on the list are the charger and the USB-C cable, we own another S8 so we compared the USB-C ends of both. The cable that came with the new device had a slightly longer end that didn't fit either device properly, not to mention that the inside was a different colour and looked sligthIy damaged. No matter what cable was being used or what device was being charged the charger would emit a loud and annoying buzzing until whatever was being charged had full batteries.The phone is performing well although it's important to note that upon first startup the phone didn't go through it's first setup process but instead went straight to the home screen. All other accessories were present in the box. tried contacting the seller regarding the issues I found to no avail. The phone is excellent, however I would not recommend the seller.
            "
"56","Let me begin by saying that due to the poor reviews and questions regarding whether the phone has a manufacturer warranty or comments that the phone was not new, received without included accessories, or stopped working shortly after being purchased, I went direct to Samsung to purchase an S8 as my S6 suddenly stopped working.I had no problem paying a slight premium to know that I'd be getting a warranty and a new phone, however after placing my order on Samsung.com, I was informed the S8 was backordered for two weeks. Since I was without a phone and AT&T wanted over $900 to purchase up front, I didn't have much of a choice and decided to try purchasing this one from Amazon.I placed my order on Friday, purchased the supplemental warranty from SquareTrade, and my phone was delivered just as I got home that evening. Even with the SquareTrade warranty, the total price was still less than what Samsung wanted just for the S8.The phone was in the original Samsung packaging and contained all of the standard accessories including the wall charger, cord, adapters for a USB to Micro USB and Micro USB to USB-C, headphones, pamphlets, and the protective plastic on the phone. It was clearly brand new.I logged into my Samsung account after setting the phone up and entered the IMEI number. The phone came right up and stated a valid Samsung warranty. I confirmed this with Samsung customer service as well. The warranty is for 12 months and covers everything aside from water and physical damage, so the SquareTrade warranty should cover the physical damage portion.As for the phone itself the picture and sound quality is fantastic, the camera is great, and it is overall super user friendly. Battery life is OK as it will run a full day with heavy use, but my S6 was nearly dead by early afternoon so I can¡¯t complain.Overall I¡¯m very happy with this purchase. Received the phone hours after ordering and it was in perfect condition with everything I expected. I have AT&T and I just inserted my SIM card and was good to go. I understand the negative reviewers may have had bad experiences so I cannot comment on the consistency of the phones but mine was great all around.
            "
"57","Learning experienceI¡¯ve been out of the phone market for a long time. Our Samsung S3 & S4 were excellent for many years. They started crashing, so it was time to buy new. I did not want to spend a grand on new phones, so started with Motorola G6 from Costco, on sale for $189. Before I get into the details, while speaking with my carrier tech support, I was directed to Amazon and the S8 on sale for $449.00. That is a grand for two phones. I sat down with the Motorola and Samsung side by side.My old phones had visual voice mail (no data required) and I could send photos via text through wi-fi to save on data. Neither the Motorola or Samsung will do that, and after speaking with a bunch of folks apparently no new phones will do that without third party apps. Data must be turned on to use visual voice mail or send photos. What a rip-off. You would thing since the consumer spends a significant amount of money on Samsung products or whatever brand you prefer, they would be vastly superior to the old phones-not so. Buy a carrier-based phone and they have an app for visual voice mail, but not so for unlocked phones. Using the phones side by side for a few days, I did not see the value of over double the price of the Samsung vs. the G6, so the new S8¡¯s go back to Amazon. I¡¯ve always been a Samsung fan, but am disappointed that the industry has gone this route. Wish my old S4 still worked, I¡¯d keep it.
            "
"58","Relative to what I would have paid if I'd gone full price, I'm happy with the phone overall.I did a side by side comparison of the used device and the brand new device I ordered on my own and with enmployees at the ATT store and none of us could find any imperfections so A+ in that regard.However, after less than two months the speaker is terrible. It sounds like I'm playing whatever I'm listening to (mostly music and podcasts) from the inside of a box. I thought the muffled noise issue might have something to do with water exposure after being near the shower (I know, I know, water resistant does not mean waterproof), so I took some precautionary measures as soon as I noticed the distortion, turned it off, and tossed it in a bag with silica gel overnight. For a phone that's advertised as being resistant to spills, it's kind of a joke that sitting on a shelf outside a shower could spell disaster for its audio output.Additionally, the phone is a lot less durable than one would expect. I still expected the glass screen to be more resistant to scratches.
            "
"59","After reading the reviews, I was a little skeptical about purchasing this  phone, from this seller.  But I had no problem with having Verizon activate this phone. I am on a prepaid plan with Verizon kamma and all they did was walk in to the Verizon store ,and he put the SIM card in, he got on the phone ,asked me a few questions and it was activated.  When I told him what I read online , about some Verizon reps saying the phone wasn't compatible, he agreed that there may have been a ploy to get them to return that phone, and buy it through the Verizon store.  Considering I live in the northeast, and we have had several snowstorms ,  The seller kept me updated as to when my prime Amazon delivery would get to me. It was due to be delivered on a Thursday, but was ultimately delivered on Saturday. Absolutely great experience all the way around
            "
"60","Very happy to find the Samsung S8 unlocked version on an Amazon Warehouse deal. I saved tons of money, and the phone came brand new in the box with plastic protectors still on and everything intact. One CAUTION about buying an unlocked phone is some features that your carrier offers may not work. For instance, I have AT&T, and I don't have Visual Voicemail on this phone. You should research online before you buy an unlocked phone for your particular carrier and see what may not work on the unlocked version. But other than the minor nuisance, I love the freedom of being able to take the phone to whatever Network I may want to use.  In terms of the phone itself, I personally don't like the curved screen aspect at all. But it works very similarly to my Samsung S6 (RIP),  and you pretty much have to keep upgrading (unfortunately) to keep a fast, functional, supported phone.
            "
"61","First and foremost, the Samsung Galaxy S8 has been one of my favorite Android smartphones of all time. The camera quality, for amateur photographers like myself, is pretty darn good. Furthermore, the processor is super fast and responsive, which compared to the Galaxy S5 that I had, is a huge upgrade. Also, the battery life is amazing. For me, with excessive use of listening to music, scrolling through social media, and other nonsense stuff, the charge lasted from 5-6am to around 10pm or 11pm. Overall, I was very impressed with the phone.Some things that I personally did not like: - the side button that kept triggering the assistant was super annoying. Even after disabling the assistant, hitting the button would still bring up the interface for it - audio quality wasn't the greatest; however, what phone has perfect audio - the screen size was also larger than the standard screen size at the time. So videos and images taken with other devices didn't fit perfectly on the screen, which was slightly annoyingOverall, I was satisfied with my purchase of a certified refurbished phone from Warehouse Deals, Inc UNTIL my phone wouldn't turn on one day while I was studying abroad in Costa Rica. I tried both hard resetting and soft resetting the phone to try to get it turned on, but nothing worked. Eventually, once I returned to the US, I sent the phone into Samsung, mistakenly thinking my phone was still under warranty, and it turns out that whoever declared the product that I received as ""certified refurbished"" was clearly mistaken as there was a huge problem with the circuit board with my phone that was more than likely caused by this ""refurbishing"" process or by the previous customer who had sold the phone to Warehouse Deals, Inc. Furthermore, since Amazon does not supply the IMEI number on the receipt, Samsung could not fulfill the request to fix the phone per the warranty, and I would have had to pay over $600 to repair it. Moral of the story, I recommend buying a warranty, either through Samsung or Amazon, with the purchase of a certified refurbished phone to avoid the hassle that I went through, unless you want to waste $500 on a phone that only lasts 3 months due to a hardware malfunction.
            "
"62","I wanted to write a review about the product because other reviews helped me when deciding on whether or not to get this phone. AllI can say is get this phone. The phone itself is beautiful. It's sleek and fits nicely in your hand. The processor is fast, it's very responsive, and all around a great phone for this price. I've always been an Android user and this phone doesn't disappoint. Most of these reviews are about Bixby and how annoying she is, how the battery isn't as good as other Samsung phones, and the list can go on and on. Regardless of those things, I think it's still an all around great phone, because nothing is perfect. For this price, I would recommend getting this phone! Just remember to keep it protected no matter what! Hope this review helped other skeptical buyers! :)
            "
"63","I love it.  It works like a charm.  I just wish they kept the LED notice lights where I could program the different apps and callers with as with the older versions.  You should download the Google keyboard, I kept hitting the period button instead of the space bar with the key board that it came with.
            "
"64","I know I shouldn't be surprised how much nicer the Galaxy S8 is than my S4, but good golly!  It's not difficult to make the transition; the way it works is very similar.  But it's got like an intuitive little brain inside it that knows exactly what I want to do next!  I love it.  And they say old dogs can't learn new tricks.  I feel so technologically capable and advanced!
            "
"65","Okay. There are lots of negative reviews about this phone but honestly I absolutely LOVE this phone. I used to have an s5 until it got old. I switched to LG for 6 months and I missed my galaxy phone. So I decided to splurge and get myself an s8! That being said... this phone NEEDS A GOOD CASE. I work around concrete floors so I made certain to buy a solid, shock resistant case with protection around the edges. I also got a glass screen protector just out of paranoia. The phone works incredibly well and performs my level of work I need it to do with no problems. :)
            "
"66","This product was a scam.  I could not get rid of viral malware, so brought it to a Samsung repair center.  The IMEI does not match the phone.  They opened it and found unauthorized hardware inside.
            "
"67","That was a great price. Took the nano sim straight from our One Plus 2, inserted and booted up and worked 100% (tmobil). Painless switchover! Battery is better than my S6, not twice the life of when the Sy was new, but significantly longer between charges. My S6¡¯s camera is still hard to beat, but for processing, graphics speed and display, and the extensible storage make this a clear winner!
            "
"68","It is as satisfactory as my Droid but the screen broke very easily, light impact.  Two weeks old.  So bummed as it was my first phone which I purchased outright.  Get your screen covers immediately or a case with a cover.Bixby button is where you hold the phone.  If you don't use Bixby you spend frequent and frustrating moments accidentally turning it on and the of course off.  Nuisance.  Good photo quality.If you use Page Plus, there is no Wifi Calling option provided for on their SIM card making good connection unreliable.  Odd as it is the same Verizon network but what do I know?
            "
"69","The phone was delivered ahead of schedule which is always a plus and was exactly as advertised. Had no problem smart switching info from previous S4 and carrier activation (Sprint to AT&T) was seamless. BTW, Something not advertised, I did find that the S8 will not allow custom sounds to be tagged to individual contacts when messaging. Ring tones sure, but no messaging notifications. So now no matter who messages you, they all sound the same something to keep in mind if that's important to you. I'm told there are work arounds and Apps you can download, but..........Will modify review later if anything changes.
            "
"70","Samsung is on a roll right now when it comes to making flagship devices. The S8 bundles in good looks, an amazing screen and some great software features.I was a bit hesistant buying a samsung phone due to their infamous software lag and heavy skins on top of android. But this UI is much better than previous samsung releases.The only cons are the late software updates and possiblity of the phone slowing down in a couple of months. But for now everything works great.
            "
"71","I had this phone for about 2 months before it overheated. The phone become so hot I couldn't hold it and my case remained hot 5 minutes after removing. All apps stopped working and the phone shut off and wouldn't power on. The only reason I'm giving this a 3 star rating is because Amazon and the seller made it a hassle free return.

"72","Had a blackberry PRIV with Android that cost me gazzilion and died on me in about a year.As soon as I turned this phone on, immediately noticed incredible difference as to the speed: opening apps, installing, uninstalling, opening and browsing the internet - bam! everything happens just about immediately with this phone, no delays, no ""thinking"" no crashing (so far).One thing that annoys me a bit is really how sophisticated the phone is, like if you put it on a table screen down it will do certain things, face up others, tons of options for how the screen will behave what light what notifications even the movement of the phone itself makes it behave differently, basically I'd have to spend many hours figuring it out that's the only thing but I guess there are bigger problems out there..
            "
"73","If you want a gorgeous device with a great camera and amazing specs look no further. When I got the S8 I was a little worried about it being used. To my surprise it was absolutely perfect. I had a couple concerns and after emailing the seller and they went above and beyond to help. I'm completely satisfied with my purchase.
            "
"74","I ordered this on Black Friday and after waiting a few weeks it arrived. I didn't expect to actually enjoy an Android based phone, but I was pleasantly surprised. My carrier fully supports this phone and I consistently get maximum speeds in my city (150/20). At home I get gigabit wifi. It was a little weird to look at the curved sides, but I got used to it after about 2 days. I highly recommend the OtterBox Defender case because this phone, like many others, is a bit too thin for large hands.
            "
"75","Phone is cool, can definitly do a lot with it. For once I actually found some of the pre-installed apps to be usefull. Disapointed in the battery life, not nearly as good as all the hype.
            "
"76","The best phone ever! !The specs of this phone don't speak out much, but this phone is filled with tons of features, just name the feature. It is thin, perfect looking, brilliant camera. Looks great in our hands. BATTERY My old phone used to consume around 80% of the battery life during the day but this phone has only consumed 35%. Amazing perforce. The new Bixby feature is a great move by Samsung. Google assistant makes the phone even better. The new screen off feature is too good. The edge feature is very usefull at times. Has fingerprint scanner face scanner and iris scanner. The iris scanner, my favorite,  is super fast much better than the iPhone X. The finger print sensor is awkward in position but its super fast too. The screen is mind blowing. Dont hesitate to buy this... Worst every penny
            "
"77","I wa using the device until battery goes to 0% and turned off. I tried to charge it, but phone no powered up neither by wire charger or wirless charger.After return the phone for warranty, Samsung found a PBA damage. But  due to some scratches in LCD screen, they denied doing the repair under warranty, and demanded a repair fee of U$637.Obviously, is cheaper buy a new one. But it is a better business for me to buy an Iphone.
            "
"78","Bought this phone for my wife. We have Verizon as our carrier so we were just a tad nervous if it would work or not. Received the item with no scratches or ding marks. Screen was perfect. Put in her SIM card from her S7 Edge and the phone immediately picked up Verizon. No issues. All of the apps on her old phone transferred perfectly to the new phone. Battery seems to be in great shape. It holds a charge very well. So far no issues what so ever. Keeping fingers crossed that it stays this way. We are Prime members so we knew we would be ok for the first couple of weeks if we had any problems with the product, but so far, all is good! Very happy.
            "
"79","The phone is amazing and everything I expected. This review is to confirm other reviews and share what I had to go through to get this phone activated through Verizon.I took the phone to Verizon to get a new SIM card (old Note 4 has Micro sim, this phone has Nano sim) and the Verizon employees said it was not Verizon compatible (error messages came up when they scanned the box) and I had to contact customer service to see if the phone could be added to the Verizon database. The customer service employee was very helpful and reassured me that the phone was Verizon compatible and everything looked good with the phone in their system when she looked up the phone's ID number. They mailed me a new sim card and walked me through over the phone on switching the new sim card. Everything worked well and my phone works fine on our Verizon plan. I saw other reviews of people in similar situations and wanted to confirm that Verizon's customer service was helpful and this unlocked phone worked for me on our Verizon plan by going through these steps. The Verizon store employees either do not have the power in store to recognize the phone or they tell you it is not compatible to try and get you to sign a contract through them and spend more money. Going through customer service was the way to go and within 4 days of getting the phone from Amazon, I got the new sim card from Verizon and my new phone is working great!
            "
"80","YES!!! It works on Verizon wireless. I took out the sim chip out of my working s6 and plugged it into the s8 and it just worked!!! Nothing else needed, no activation needed.This is an early review.. Ill append as I fiddle around with the phone.Con:  NO IR blaster (so no controlling infrared devices like a TV or Cable box unless theyre ""smart"" devices on the same network) so you cant use it as a universal remote control like I did with the S5 and S6
            "
"81","I bought this phone when it was on sale for $625. Great deal, based on other prices. I purchased this after my Galaxy S5 died. Coming from the S5, this is a major upgrade. The phone is beautiful, but due to my tendency to drop phones, I have it in a case. I expected to be annoyed by Bixby (based on other reviews), but I actually like ""her"" so far. She's not Siri, but I think she is better than Google's personal assistant. I like that you can unlock the phone by telling Bixby a voice password and because she learns your voice, she won't respond to another voice. My husband tried to talk to her and she ignored him.Besides Bixby, there are a number of upgrades from the S5. Rather than several pages with apps (you can still do that), there is an edge ""tray"" that you can use to easily access your favorite apps. I strongly recommend watching a youtube video to get to know the phone because it can do a lot. Without it, I wouldn't have known about the edge tray, because it is well hidden. I've only had the phone for less than 24 hours, but I will update the review if my opinion changes.
            "
"82","For the most part this is worth the money.  There is a slight scratch on the screen that isn't noticeable unless you try to look at it. Other than a small scuff on the top edge of the phone (which you can't see with a case on) it is in great cosmetic condition.  Now the battery life is OK but not great.  Auccu Battery says that only 2,879/3,000mah is being used so my battery life isn't as what a new phone would be like. The battery also gets a little warm while playing video games such as PUBG on Recommened settings. But the thing about that is that the seller never told me that this phones battery was in the shape that it is in.
            "
"83","Nothing wrong with this unlocked phone itself but it was not totally compatble with Verizon. Advanced calling features such as wifi calling, hd etc are not available. Also no 4g or 3g only lte. I do not recommend purchasing if you have verizon. Had to return phone and buy a phone with Verizon software.
            "
"84","I should have spent more time looking into this phone. If you search - galaxy s8 searching for gps - you will find at the samsung support site entries dating from 5/11/2017 to today(2/6/2019) about its inability to function.  I have tried the vague solutions they offer without success.  Rare times after hitting start on google maps the directions work for about a minute or two, but never longer, and usually not at all. Messaging, email and gps directions are what I purchased this phone for. Avoid it if you need gps. Understand this is not directed at the seller, the seller performed as promised, quick delivery and as advertised.
            "
"85","Bought this for the wife, as she had an S5 with 16 gig...and she was out of space and her text messages wouldn't come in.  This S8  is awesome, the only downside is the stupid Bixby app(lost a star Samsung because you can't reprogram it)...would be nice if you could reprogram the button to launch a different app...
            "
"86","I was so excited about this phone but what i got is an international version with non us adapter, I verified the IMEI number on Samsung site and it says no warranty:(I have to return the phone now, such a waste of time :
            "
"87","The phone was directly from Amazon Warehouse and was original. The weight and feel is great . Set up was easy. The was glitches so far or spontaneous restarting. Touch is good. There are lots of new features. The only problem was that notifications did not come in in real time in sleep mode....but, after digging around on the internet, I discovered that the battery usage and saving feature in special permissions was the problem. Works fine now.
            "
"88","i purchased my galaxy s8 and everything was great and running perfectly. After about a month or two of me having service under metro pcs (yes i know they arent the best) my phone randomly started saying that i couldnt receive service anymore. after taking it yo metro pcs, i was told they cannot really help me because it was not purchased from. the phone still works fine and this review was written from the actual phone but i cannot have service turned on because of (as it was explained to me) a problem with unlocked phones being kind of a roll of the dice especially when purchasing it online. i didnt want to go through fighting with the company to work a deal with samsung on my warranty because i didnt have time working 14 hours a day and seeing reviews saying that they dont help you anyway.overall the phone is awesome and works fine. that has been my only issue and ive had the phone for nearly a year in 3 months. i guess you get what you paid for, saving a couple hundred but cannot get service. it works on wifi but cant call or text from it but i have to much on here to get rid of it or something.
            "
"89","i upgraded from the S5 to the S8 what a major difference i activated it on the verizon network and since i already had a verizon phone it was as easy as installing my verison sim card in the S8 and turning it on. I would highly recommend this phone
            "
"90","The phone itself is great, but not the primary reason for this review. Amazon customer service is. Concerns were raised upon delivery when the seal on the box was compromised, but both items were still inside. Upon further inspection, I noticed there was no factory seal on the phone box itself, which essentially voids the ""new"" description of the phone. I immediately called customer service to voice my concerns and have them noted on the order. They understood and promptly began working on a solution. The adequate compensation was nice, but not my priority. Having the notes on the order in the event that I discover problems with the device was. I was told that if something should surface, the problem will be addressed, resolved, or replaced. I found comfort in that. So overall, Amazon customer service was great in this case. The device itself has exceeded my expectations so far, and would recommend it. In fact, I'll be looking into purchasing another for my other half.
            "
"91","This phone is just amazing. With the included app and USB cable adapters it was super easy to transfer all my files, including text messages from my old Motorola Droid to this Samsung S8. For those that are wondering, I was able to easily set up this new phone up with Verizon. Did not even need to call in. Anyone who says this phone does not work with Verizon is wrong. I can't say enough good things about this phone. If you are thinking about it, just buy one. You will love it! Wish the speaker where a little louder, but otherwise this phone is perfect.
            "
"92","Almost like my nexus 6p better.. This phone does have wifi calling, something i use since i have poor mobile coverage where i live. It charges fast and does the trick... just wish Samsung would perfect the wifi to data crossovers better.  seems like it gets hung up (no pun intended) on the change overs.... i have to airplane mode it more times than not
            "
"93","Unlocked phone that works as expected.  I purchased to use with prepaid service and was very difficult to activate.  They kept saying the phone was not unlocked.  After about 2 hours was able to resolve.
            "
"94","My high school son received this phone just over a year ago, and has had no problems with it and is still using it. So this is the second one we have purchased for our house. My complaint, when this one arrived was the fact that this multiple hundred dollar item was in a box 3 times it size with absolutely no packing at all. It was just free floating from one end of the box to the other when I pick it up. Just the lack of respect for my money to not take the time to humor me with some packing ticked me off
            "
"95","Gorgeous phone. All glass. Fingerprint sensor location is not so bad as reviews indicate.Disabling app power manager/optimize battery is a must for receiving notifications in timely manner. If you need just led notifications but no sound, you need to download and use silent.mp3 tone.Bixby button not so scary since it can be remapped.Looks frigile I would never use a case, so really hope I don't drop it.Very nice deal at $460, thanks amazon!
            "
"96","After reading some of the questions and answers I contacted my local Verizon affiliate and told them that I wanted to activate this phone.  I've been a good customer there over the years and they were eager to help me.  Basically we activated a new micro SIM card in a used phone they had using my existing number.  We then transferred the SIM card into this phone and basically the deal was done.  I still had to log into my google account and use the Samsung transfer setup to move info but it all went smooth.  Really enjoying this phone!  What a camera!
            "
"97","Was a decent phone until the burn in started to become noticable 6 months in. Now closer to a year the screen burn in is unbearable. Planned obsolescence at its finest.Good antenna good battery. Bixby doesn't seem any more useful than google assitant.
            "
"98","Such a great phone! After doing months of research, I wasn't sure which phone to choose. Pixel 2, LG V30, S8 or even iPhone.  I finally decided the S8 has most everything I wanted.  Wireless charging, great camera, decent battery and a perfect screen!After a month, I am so happy with my decision!  Wonderful phone, perfect!
            "
"99","I was very happy that I upgraded to the S8 and was loving it all week until I realized it wouldn't let me connect to any wifi at all besides the one at my home. My college has free wifi and it worked perfectly fine on my S7edge, but on my S8, it said wifi is blocked. I tried wifi in Mcdonalds, parks, restaurants, and the wifi are all blocked. What on earth? It said I should contact my phone provider or what not and I am kind of really upset.
            "
"100","Been an iPhone user since the 4, up until this baby came into my life. Initially I was scared to take the leap but I'm glad I did. The s8 is the most beautiful phone I've come across and I'm so happy that it's mine. It does everything I need and more. If you're thinking about switching to Android, this is the sign for you to take that leap.Fast shipping & perfect condition! All I had to do to activate mine (w Verizon) was transfer my sim card from my 6+ to the s8 and voila! I'm a very happy girl with my new s8 :)
            "
"101","Came packaged in different box,but was in fantastic condition!! Looked brand new! (Even if it was just a recently released phone and used) It definitely gets a thumbs up from me! And my wife is definitely loving her ¡°new ¡° phone!!!
            "
"102","Exactly as described.  Samsung makes high quality products and the true rival to iPhones, if you are not an Apple fan.-Pros:Unlocked as described, just insert SIM Card and I'm in business.Sleek designBattery life is good (expected since is a new phone, let's see after a few months)Updates to Android 8.0 Oreo without rooting it.-Cons (for me)Comes with Facebook pre-installed, can be disable if you are not a Facebook user, but can't be remove.Bixby app (Samsung Assistant version of Alexa, ""Ok, Google""), not interested in another assistant
            "
"103","Second smart phone I got on Amazon. Got another great deal! The only issue is with Verizon for what ever reason when I have a voice message it does not notify me or have an indicator because I did not get it from Verizon. That is what the Verizon tech told me. Otherwise I am very happy with this purchase.
            "
"104","I am sure I would have liked this phone as I had done plenty of research before purchasing. The phone itself is fine however upon boot it appeared to be defaulted to Spanish. Not a good sign. The phone is touted to be an unlocked US version of the phone, however, this does not appear to be the case for the one I got. After changing the language for the phone and pulling the version number (SM-G950F), I determined this one to be a European version. There is NO CDMA radio capability and Verizon fails to provision this phone on their network. A bit disappointed and returning.
            "
"105","I have Verizon and they said that this wasn't an Unlocked phone. I am returning this.
            "
"106","Works well with armor case.  I applied with case on to get an exact fit.  Bubbles disappeared within 2 days to leave a completely transparent voating..  So far protector has stayed on without issue for nine days.  I like the texture and touch sensitivity is gone.
            "
"107","I was super nervous buying a phone this expensive from Amazon, but Samsung.com apparently has an issue with selling to persons outside the US. So I read all the reviews and decided to go with a seller whose order would be fulfilled by Amazon...just in case, you know? Thankful to say, the phone is great! (sigh of relief!) No issues whatsoever unlocked as described, although it does seem to be Verizon-based, but my local carrier's sim card works fine. Camera quality is great, battery life is good and honestly I am very happy with my purchase. Yay!
            "
"108","If you are hesitant about buying this phone, simple .. DONT BE. I love it. I really don't need to be writing 4 paragraphs to explain how great it is, you'll see as soon as you try it out. But yah anyways, I STRONGLY recommend.Don't listen to negative reviews.
            "
"109","S8 has a consistent and better, more intuitive user interface than prior models.  Very good compatibility with common apps and applications.  But for real, does the world really need another new device with a non standard plug?  Yes, I am going to ding you -3 stars for that silliness.
            "
"110","I got this phone January 2018. It worked really well for a year. Then the battery drained to 0% while on the charger and would not charge. Wireless or a plug charging would not do a thing. Replaced the battery through a repair company only to have it happen again. Recommend just going through your service provider so you have some insurance.
            "
"111","Overall pretty nice phone. Being water resistant is a major plus, and the fact that the touch screen still mostly works while wet is amazing. It kind of stutters and lags a tiny bit which was disappointing. Battery life is hit or miss. Sometimes it lasts 2 days, and sometimes less than 1. Obviously that should be my fault for using apps that drain the battery but I can't figure out why it happens. I'm not a huge fan of the wrap around screen and it makes me really paranoid since almost no cases actually protect the sides. It could be cool technology when they do a 360 degree wrap around screen that covers the back as well, but in its current state I don't really get the point. It does look pretty though (is that the only point...?). Glare is kind of an issue. Bixby is completely awful and I can't believe Samsung locked out the button so people can't reprogram it to do something useful. I don't get why they're competing with Google on that front, and also don't understand why they're competing in the cloud storage market. Another wtf decision is why they include an awesome AMOLED screen but don't take advantage of the power saving features unless you install third party black themes.Major concern: Samsung Premium Care will not cover phones purchased from Amazon, but they will still accept your money. Super scummy move in my opinion. There was no mention of it until I asked a rep (and good thing I did).Despite my many complaints about Samsung's strange decision making, the hardware is pretty good and the stock OS works well with some tweaks.
            "
"112","The unlocked Samsung Galaxy S8 phone is fantastic.  It arrived exactly as described.  I was not able to activate online with Verizon, as my sim card was not compatible with the phone.  I went into the Verizon store and within 5 minutes it was activated at no charge.  So far it is working great.  The fingerprint reader doesn't always recognize my print, but that is not a big deal.  You can't beat the price.  Even the sales person at Verizon said that it was a great deal.My only issue was the amount of time it took to arrive.  It was shipped on the 15th in NY and stayed in NY until the 23rd.  I received it on the 25th.  Why did it not move for a week????
            "
"113","Dope phone. I'm writing this review from it. I've had it for many months now without problems. I'm on AT&T. They activated it right in the store for free, took less than 5 minutes. Picture quality is phenomenal and the phone in general is just gorgeous to look at. I don't use a case or screen protector, just a pop socket, but I also don't drop my phone. I've heard the glass is fragile, so you should consider getting a case.
            "
"114","Took it to a Verizon store and everything went smooth. The Verizon employee asked me where I purchased the phone. When I told him I bought it off Amazon he said nice phone and that it was unlocked. A lot cheaper than buying from Verizon. Pleased with purchase so far.
            "
"115","I bought this unlocked Galaxy S8 directly from Amazon - not a 3rd party seller.  Brand new, all accessories in box as advertised.  Brought it to Verizon and once we got a SIM card in it everything worked as it should.  I don¡¯t have any Verizon bloatware on the phone (unlocked) which is a bonus.  Huge upgrade from my old HTC Desire 816  in almost every aspect (though I have to admit the HTC had better stereo speakers).  Amazon price was $180 less than Verizon for the same phone.
            "
"116","There are many issues with this phone.1) battery drains extremely fast , even when not using it2) cant download MMS even after restoring APN and other fixes3) lost calls where phone doesn't ring and caller goes straight to voicemailI have had other Samsung phones in past, but none this bad.Would not recommend.
            "
"117","Bought 6 months ago, and it's everything I wanted in a phone and more! I avoided setting up Bixby, just cuz I don't use virtual assistants much. The space is so awesome!!! It's also really sturdy - I've dropped it on concrete with nothing more than a thin case to protect it, no issues whatsoever! I hope it lasts a long time!
            "
"118","My son ordered one of these and had no problems with it. It worked on the Verizon network without a problem so I ordered one for myself. When I tried to activate it the Verizon Network said that it was not compatible with their network. So it depends on which one they send you if it will work or not and unfortunately you will not know until you get the phone.
            "
"119","Listen to me right now when I say the S8 is a good phone. Holy crap its amazing super fast HD display this phone is beautiful! Mobile Internation LLC is a trustable place to buy your S8 look at the seller he sells new S8's with no lies or gimmicks. The S8 Got here in one-day I'm playing around with it currently and I'm sure it will gather a lot of attention. If I have any issues ill post them here. This is the type of phone you want to show off people.
            "
"120","Pros: The phone is fast.Good battery life.Very nice looking phone.Display looks very nice.Cons:  My hand would often unintentionally touch a part of the wrap around screen and close browser windows, apps, etc.  This happened often enough to be fairly annoying.Several apps were buggy and would close by themselves or would just not work at all (such as cycletrader app).  There were some annoying quirks with the youtube app.The fingerprint reader is the worst I've used yet, it always took at least 3 or 4 tries every time I got my phone out.  Super annoying.Facial recognition on this phone is a joke.I don't like Samsung's overlay on Android Nougat.  The Samsung keyboard sucks. Stock Android is so much nicer IMO.Overall, for a flagship phone and even at a deeply discounted price I wasn't too impressed with this one.  I have a feeling I would be much happier with a Pixel or the upcoming Pixel 2.
            "
"121","So far so good! It definitely feels good to use a Samsung again after being stuck with an LG for a bit. My only complaint is that the shipping time was postponed and when i received my package the phone was extremely hot but this is AZ so that's out of anybody's  control.
            "
"122","Outstanding replacement for my old Samsung SII which started acting a little funny.  Very clear screen, long battery life, and connects with the Bluetooth in all my vehicles in 8 seconds or less and never fails to connect.

"123","Went to connect the phone to MetroPCS and was told that the phone was reported stolen and they won¡¯t connect it.
            "
"124","Ordered two of these phones.  When we went to activate them, one was identified as ""lost or stolen"", which made it useless to us, and we had to send it back.  How can this happen?  It was described as new!

"125","Great cellphone!  It is well made and very easy to work with.  If you can, get the S8 NOTE.  I had one before this and I miss the NOTE.  Nothing beats the NOTE in any category.  I may take a $ loss and go back to/switch to the S8 NOTE.
            "
"126","Best cell phone I've had. The colors are vibrant, the camera's great not to mention lots of features. I haven't used bixby due to the reviews but I'm fine without it.
            "
"127","Beautiful. Runs fast. Worked well with a SIM card transfer on Verizon networks, instantly. Lots of neat features like running multiple windows.Flimsiest thing I've ever seen.I'd owned a Droid Turbo 2 for years that stood up to all kinds of abuse until the battery finally permanently died; This thing cannot stand up to common usage. It had a screen fracture in less than a week after a maybe two-three foot drop even with a case/screen protector on. If you can be rough on tech, avoid the hell out of this phone.
            "
"128","This is a pretty good phone and replaced a Moto X Pure.  It's sleek and attractive.  The hardware is beefy--64GB is more than enough for me.  And if I did need more, it's nice that I have the option of using a micro SD card.  The processor and ram have nice performance on apps.  Some people complain about the fingerprint sensor being near the camera.  Personally, I haven't had a problem with that.  Nor have I had a problem with the Bixby button, although it seems unnecessary.  The iris scanner, however, doesn't seem to work for me.  I'm just not using that function.The deduction of a star comes in Samsung's software.  It's not bad.  But there are going to be times where you are banging your head in frustration--'Why won't you let me do  ________?  or why won't you let me remove _______ from MY PHONE?'  For some people, that may be Bixby.  Personally I'm using it in conjunction with Google Assistant and that seems to be working well.  But for those that don't want it, you really shouldn't need 3rd party software to remove it.  Likewise, if you have an app that you prefer to use, then Samsung shouldn't place a barrier to keep you from removing their version.  It was great that they included some apps with a new phone; I get that.  But if I want to get rid of them in favor of something else, I shouldn't have to jump through hoops.And then there are odd situations like Samsung's built in Game Tools.  Now I'm not a heavy gamer, but there are times I'll mindlessly kill some time.  But that stinkin setting was adding 2 extra buttons on the navigation screen in the corners right near the game's buttons.  When I finally managed to kill the buttons, I was getting notifications all the time when the game started-up as well as inconvenient places in the game.  It took a $2.50 purchase for an app called BK Disabler to finally get rid of it.  It's not a lot in the scheme of things.  But man, what an aggravating experience for an otherwise solid & great phone!
            "
"129","Still beautiful and nice compared to the latest smart phones like Galaxy S9 S9+ or note seriesCompact, handy, and productive.If you say this phone is not good, you yet don't know how to use it.

"132","I bought this phone for my husband as a Christmas present.  He found it very easy to transition from his old S4 to this one (and he HATES change!!).
            "
"133","Just received my new phone in the mail! Looks real nice! Just found out that I have to have a sims card from Sprint (my service provider) in order to use it! Fortunately, they told me the sims card is free, and that I can either order one or go to the store and get it there! We shall see!
            "
"134","Just got it and activated it a few days ago. I had to go to the Metro store and pay to get it activated (wouldn't let me do it online fur some reason), but it does work for Metro. Haven't tried the facial recognition yet, but the fingerprint seems to be working fine. Overall the phone is functioning the way it should in my opinion, but of any changes occur I'll try to remember to update my review.
            "
"135","I switched from an iPhone. Took a day to get used to Android and then I just felt free. The phone is light and thin with excellent screen real estate, fingerprint scanner, and a great camera. I was able to move my SIM card directly to this phone without any interaction with my carrier or their website. Samsung also provides a Smart Switch app that transferred most of my content to the new phone via USB cable. The phone comes with an adapter so you can just use your iPhone cord if you have one.
            "
"136","This phone may be good but I wouldn¡¯t know because I received a box that only included headphones and a cord. On top of that, I am told that I have to wait three days for them to complete an investigation. To say that I am pissed would be an understatement. As a paying customer, I expect more. The issue is between the warehouse and the shipper, and has nothing to do with me, yet, I am the one being punished.
            "
"137","Phone works great so far. I didn't realize it came with a screen protector installed on it so I kinda freaked out when I thought the phone was delivered with a crack all the way down the middle. But I figured it out a couple days later, removed the protector and boom, perfect screen.
            "
"138","registered with Samsung, got the warranty, everything works amazingly!
            "
"139","Got this for my brother as a reward for a great school year. Paired with a case, this phone is the amazing for it's price. Holds up well on his end for gaming. On my own GS8 I have outstanding battery life and it's optimization tool just adds on to the great experience.Maximum Power Saving Mode is customizable allowing you to add compatible apps to it and manage things like brightness and CPU performance.No complaints here
            "
"140","The phone is great, but Bixby is nonresponsive the majority of the time when trying to use voice wake up. I've gone through the setup multiple times, but it still doesn't work. Google assistant wakes up with no problem so it's not the mic or me. Also Bixby works fine with the (poorly placed) Bixby button.
            "
"141","Bought this phone the other day as a replacement for a Samsung On5 phone that only had 8GB memory but worked ok just slow. Just wanted to have something better with more memory and a unlocked version. This phone seems to have some great features which I'm still exploring. The display and camera is awesome! A little pricey but in the ballpark with other competitors brands/prices. Very happy so far.
            "
"142","Just as advertised- LIKE IT ALOT!

"143","I purchased this unlocked galaxy s8 sold by Amazon and I couldn't be more pleased with the phone. Truly unlocked. The phone came with all of its accessories- charging adapter, headphones, etc. It arrived when it was expected(Thanks 2 day shipping) and with no issues at all!As far as use, I love everything about this phone. Camera quality is great compared to the phone I was coming from. The phone fits perfectly in my small hands. Overall, could not ask for anything else!
            "
"144","I don't like that phones nowadays have to be huge but I guess that's what it is. I had to get a new one because my S5 kept breaking. This is one is really good though, I'm happy I went ahead and got it.
            "
"145","This device works perfectly as advertised. Don't let the naysayers prevent you from buying this based upon the false notion it won't work with Verizon, because all that was needed was entering the IMEI code, which is listed on its back, into the Verizon website to order the necessary and free SIM card.
            "
"146","This was a t-mobile phone. Despite contacting the seller and leaving a week for them to respond, they didnt.The t-mobile app was central to everything and couldnt be removed. Sent it back.No comment on the S8. didnt get to use it.Rubbish
            "
"147","I love every aspects of this phone.Highest equality materials; camera, screen, processors, and everything.Well implemented software based on the top class computing power runs this phone seamlessly in any situation.Battery is well managed by optimization tools so that during idle time this phone seems to don't use any battery.
            "
"148","Nice looking phone that works well, but has the durability of tissue paper. $400 down the drain. Shattered the first time it was dropped (approx two feet on to flat tile floor) even with an OtterBox and the most expensive screen guard I could find. I will never buy a Samsung phone again.
            "
"149","I got this on black friday and had the deal. Since then it is okay. I however am a klutsy person so I dropped it myself. I didnt buy a screen protector because my brother whos a tech wiz said I dont need it but I now have a crack through the camera lense. Other than that I love this phone.
            "
"150","Beautiful phone, however if you use Page Plus this device will not work. I have bought 2 phone off amazon and 1 off Ebay trying to take the cheap rout, but I am going to have to just buy this particular phone off the Page Plus website. I hope this review helps fellow Page Plus users.
            "
"151","Knox, and old security software by Samsung, is no longer in service. So when you try to ""register"" it upon boot-up, it doesn't register any accounts. But you can't leave the Knox portal log-in due uninstall it. Can't access calls, camera, texts...totally useless. We'll be sending this back in the next day or so.

"152","I purchased this phone for my wife as a Christmas gift, she is absolutely loving it! It works perfectly, and has amazing features; I'm honestly a little bit jealous, haha.Also, just an FYI, this phone IS compatible with Boost Mobile.

"153","I JUST RECEIVED MY UNLOCKED GALAXY S8 TODAY FROM AMAZON. WENT TO VERIZON AFTER WORK AND HAD NO PROBLEMS AT ALL GETTING IT ACTIVATED.. IT TOOK LESS TIME TO ACTIVATE THAN IT DID STANDING IN LINE . COST ME $10.00 FOR THE SIM CARD. I'VE READ SOME OF THE REVIEWS WHERE PEOPLE HAD A HARD TIME AT VERIZON..THAT WAS NOT MY EXPERIENCE AT ALL ! IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS PHONE UNLOCKED I SAY DO IT !! AND I PURCHASED THE UNLOCKED VERSION, NOT THE VERIZON UNLOCKED AND NOT A PROBLEM ! HAPPY CUSTOMER AMAZON !
            "
"154","Item received on time. After a couple of days of use the speakers did not work anymore. The device has been restoring media for several days  with a current recovery progress of 11% (73 MB out of 656 MB), the wireless charger stops working continuously and the Wi-Fi connection also stops working with no reason. I have been out of country for a month and for this reason return time was closed.
            "
"155","Seriously LOVE this phone. It is my companion, and I fall in love with it every time I take a picture in nature. I live in a small valley, and I've never been more able to capture the beauty of it than with this phone. If you are on the fence, get off and run (do not walk) to buy this phone. Don't pay over a grand on competition (cough cough ""X"") when this phone is absolutely INCREDIBLE at almost half the cost. I could go on and on... But seriously, I love this phone.
            "
"156","This phone is the best! Love how it looks, how it works, and it's not heavy or big at all.
            "
"157","Great deal on a flagship phone without needing to worry about the carrier bloatware. I was pleasantly surprised that the ""used"" phone I purchased is basically brand new besides some fairly faint scratches on the screen. Had no issues powering the device on out of the box, and it even came with a complimentary case.This is only receiving a star less because the USB C cable that shipped with it was broken on arrival. Not a big deal, but a bit of a headache when you need to charge the phone.
            "
"158","I've only had the phone for 2 full days so I'm still learning.  But it is user friendly.  I like the size and the different sounds.  On my Blu phone though I could get text messages without having the data turned on.  That would be the biggest thing that I do not like so far.
            "
"159","Phone speaks for itself.  Only way to go if buying upfront - equal payments, no interest and priced right!

"162","I love my new phone!! I was apprehensive about buying an unlocked phone but it was brand new out of the box, I took it down to my local Sprint store and they set it up for me, free of charge as well. I'm now trying to get my husband to upgrade his phone as well.
            "
"163","This is a quality phone, its fast, it has expandavle storage and it was created this year and is one of the cheaper flagships and although I prefer Google assistant bixby does a good job at what it was designed to do. Bixby can download apps for you if you are to lazy to type and that is basically all I use it for, otherwise Google assistant all the way.
            "
"164","Works great was worried that it wouldn't but in posting this review on my new phone!!!
            "
"165","Love this phone.  Not the biggest but after putting a Temdan ALL proof case on it, I wouldn't want the S8+.  It would just big too big...and I'm 6'4"" with huge hands.
            "
"166","I moved from an iPhone 6 to the Samsung S8 because of the recurring battery issues. The first thing I noticed about the Samsung S8 is the significantly longer battery life. The phone is not as user-friendly as the iPhone, but that might be more a function of having been a longtime iPhone user (my learning curve). The phone looks great, comes with a lot of great apps and is relatively easy to set up. There are some quirks that will take some time to get used to, but that's probably true for any new phone. Overall it's a great phone.
            "
"167","I love this phone, so many extras, so much fun and great pics.  I have been a Samsung fan for years fourth galaxy phone and each is more impressive than the last.  This is out of the park. Between camera, bixby, and battery life phone is wonderful.
            "
"168","Every day I have to restart the phone at once to be able to use it. It keeps advising that I have no network registered when I do....it is frustrating at times
            "
"169","The screen is a great size, it runs fast, its slick and sleek. And now Samsung has finally allowed you to disable the Bixby button! Texting is oddly very slow but I can live with that.
            "
"170","Phone is NOT new!I payed $600 for this ""new"" phone a few months ago, this past weekend it stopped charging suddenly and wouldn't turn on, when I took it to a repair service they informed me that the item had been previously tampered with and that it was NOT new and that the warranty expired way before I bought it!Now they want to refund me only for the amount the phone is selling now and not what I payed for!DO NOT buy this.
            "
"171","If you have the money, go for it. High performances, great pictures, good battery life, and comes with some useful Samsung software on top of the native android.The only drawback, is that battery optimization is so good, that prevent application like Strava from running properly by blocking its background access to resources.! So, if you are planning to use Strava, have a second thought.  Still it deserves 5 stars.
            "
"172","Amazing product!the only downside that i can tell  about this phone is the localiton of the fingerprint sensor.
            "
"173","Fairly intuitive features, good size/weight, and thankfully Bixby can be turned off. (Disclaimer: I probably was easy to please since my previous phone was an S4.)

I have had the phone about 2 weeks now and I love it. My SIM card on my s5 was way too big, so I just went to the Verizon store and told them I upgraded - SIM card was $10 and I was outa there in 20 mins, they took care of setting it up too.
            "
"185","Im sure the S8 is a great phone, but I ordered from Amazon Warehouse ""like new"" and the back cover was not even glued on correctly and was already coming off during unboxing. It was a great price, but quality control is obviously lacking here. Returning immediately.

"187","I chose this provider because I wanted an unlocked phone from a Samsung official provider that was advertised as being from the USA. I live overseas and it was important that I be able to use the phone in the USA and abroad. Not only was the phone not unlocked, it was also made or sourced? from Germany, so it was unable to be unlocked. Buyer beware! This is NOT a trustworthy source!

"194","Beautiful device. Fits a little smaller in hand vs previous Galaxy and runs just as smooth. Aesthetically pleasing and the slightly larger screen is gorgeous. All black themes look so nice with this. Would 10/10 buy again
            "
"195","Great phone, lots of features that going from a budget phone to something this advanced has kind of floored me on its capabilities and camera quality. Order from a trusted seller and you're golden, all I had to do was pop out my old sim card, do a quick transfer of settings and contacts and I was done without ever stepping in a phone store.

The packing was new, everything came out of the package as expected (charger, earphones, etc)Just a reminder, if you are going to use it somewhere else, do not forget to buy yourself a plug adapter, since the one that comes out of the box is the US plug.Handsome phone.. loved it
            "
"201","IF YOU want to save money and buy a good phone , u need to choose amazon warehouse. It is expensive than other third part one. But the batteryof this phone is good just use 2 times. However the button for the start is a little bit loose but it is okay considering that it is cheap than new s8
            "
"202","Great hardware but two things that make it terrible. Software especially phone dailer is terrible compared to stock android. You have to have a separate app just to check your voicemail with the S8 vs a Pixel where it is included with the dailer and a breeze to use. It may not sound like much but spending extra time going to that app wastes a lot time over time.  Also that bixby thing is terrible.  They won't let you turn it off without a Samsung account that they use to track you.  It pops all the time but after a while you figure out how to get it to stop saying ""hello, this bixby"" and then you learn how to get it stopped right away. Once again a big waste of time but at least it becomes less of a pain.  But really, why put up with any pain when this phone costs over $600?  Skip it, keep your old phone if it still works or buy something else.
            "
"203","I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it! It was easy to set up - he was able to transfer all his data, contacts, etc from his old phone very easily.

"213","I have had my galaxy S8 for 5 months now. Overall good phone. Only problem is the rear camera broke. Normally I'd attribute that to user error but I have a pretty robust case on it with no damage to to the screen. I've read that there might be a defect on the camera cover that causes it to shatter when you change altitude/temperature. Just something to keep in mind.
            "
"214","The phone is amazing it came slighty scuffed but buyers beware gorilla glass 5 is the most fragile glass ever it will protect agaisnt nail nicks and soft movements of coins or keys but any extreme movement with any metal will leave deep grooves its a manufacturer problem can be fixed by buying a screen protector.

"232","Don't be scared to buy this phone. This will work with Verizon. I went to a local store and the dumb sales girls gave me a dirty look and said it won't work. I asked her to still try. She typed some numbers and told me it's not working. So I just bought a sim card from them and called Verizon customer support. The lady that was on the phone got mine to work with in 10-15 mins.So if you are worried that this might not work with Verizon, don't be scared. It works. Just buy a new sim card and call the customer support instead of going into a store.

"236","Product came like new with no issues! Easily activated at the Verizon store. I'll update this review later with more details about the phone itself.
            "

            "
"238","Compact, light weight, very good picture, phone could be clearer.
            "
"239","Excellent phone. I am still using it to this date and the battery is still fine. Samsung made it perfect, fast, reliable, excellent camera, among other things.
            "
"240","Cannot get Verizon voice mail or Family Base to work on this phone.  Verizon says there is no way to add these services!  Wish this had been clear in the description before I purchased.  I have found NO VOICE MAIL APP that will work on this phone!
            "
"241","I ordered two phones.  Product delivered as advertised and on time.  I had no problem activating them to my service provider.
            "
"242","I love this phone.  It takes great pictures.
            "
"243","phone like new. If you told me this phone was refurbished i'd tell you you were lying this thing is immaculate!! I have verizon and i just popped my sim card in there with no problem and it worked right away. I honestly love this phone, worth every penny!!
            "
"244","Nice phone. Switched from iPhone because it's a more open system and allows user to make choices but with that said it is not as intuitive as the iPhone.  I also like Suri much better.
            "
"245","It works. I got it for Sprint. I went to the  Sprint store because they needed to use a different SIM card, but it was done for free.
            "
"246","I love this phone so much! Best picture quality I've ever had, and loving the wireless charger. The setup is easy to use and I'm enjoying the Samsung benefits
            "
"247","Easily the best android device released in 2017. A few software quirks and slow updates keep it from 5 stars.
            "
"248","Perfect...... I was kind of sceptical about it because of the bad comments but thank goodness I didn't take them on and I ordered it.
            "
"249","Great phone. Switched from iOS to Android and love it. This phone has all the specs of an iphone plus more. The display is absolutely amazing. Can't go wrong with the galaxy line of phones.

            "
"253","Love it. Came on time with all its accessories.
            "
"254","The phone is great, however Boost kept trying to refuse to activate the phone under grounds it wasn't eligible, but when I put the sim card in the phone it bypassed that nonsense and activated anyways. Great phone so far.
            "
"255","For some reason, my phone comes not sealed or anything. Furthermore, the edge screen isn't responsive at times.
            "
"256","Love this phone. Great quality. Will probably purchase more Samsung products in the future.
            "
"257","Great phone I love it!! But it does NOT come with an SD card so make sure you have a compatible one ahead of time!
            "
"258","Quick shipping, great phone
            "
"259","I was really apprehensive about spending so much on a phone from the internet after buying store phones for so long. Definitely new! Best phone I've had in years! Glad I took a chance! Mind you I bought 2!
            "
"260","Really nice phone i have dropped twice without cover  while i was waiting for my cover and has had no damage. Plus really nice camara default down fault censor botton is net to camara but i will get use to it

            "

            "
"267","I am very satisfied with the product and the dispay seems like a 3d picture. I think i made a right decision from switching from i-phone to android. Enjoing it. Totally recommend. Nice product with this price.
            "
"268","Great phone, quick load, many apps fit, love it.  Will add to info after a few months of use in order to confirm how well it's still working.

"274","Don't buy this  phone if you want to use the camera. The camera have errors, Samsung support tried to fix it didn't solve the problem. Samsung Service center replaced the camera, worked for a few weeks before we got the same error...

"278","My Galaxy S3 was getting 'tired' and slow. Bought this S8 the same week that Samsung announced the S9 and got a heck of a deal on Amazon as retailers wanted to clear their inventories of S8's.  VERY nice phone with lots of features I'm still learning about

"289","In screen burn on AMOLED was mentioned on product description. What was mentioned was full functionality but where the burn in is located doesn't always registrator. Will not being buying again from this supplier.
            "
"290","Not happy...for the 1st few days phone worked as it should. Now it is acting like it is schizophrenic cant get back to the main screen without jumping through hoops and it is acting random. Tried shutting it down, rebooting, to NO resolve.  NOT sure why it is acting so strangely.
            "
"291","My mom loves it. I hate it, the sound is so good and loud that I always hear what she¡¯s listening to. It barely weighs and all together it¡¯s a really nice phone
            "

"295","The picture quality is great, camera is great and the speed of operation is much better than any other samsung phones. All in all this is a great one.
            "
"296","Phone would be excellent if it got any cell service.  Can only make calls and send texts if I am on wifi. I go the same places  every day, previous phone with same provider had great service. This is terrible.
            "
"297","High quality product and fast delivery
            "
"298","You wonder why I chose a 1-star rating? Well, well well...one day after getting it, turning it on, installing some apps from my old phone, getting a new sim card, and finally using it...I encountered an unrecoverable black screen of death. I tried every button combination I could find, and nothing worked.I watched the black-screen happen too...and it was charged. Now I'm up at 3am writing a review for something I now need a refund of.
            "
"299","love it i had a s5 and love the camera the speed
            "
"300","No complaints save the standard, ""where did they move this or that to?"". Used for personal and some business. A good product for a much more reasonable price.
            "
"301","Bought it months ago after clinging to my S4 for too long and I am in love with the many features.
            "
"302","Everything was perfect until I got the notorious wet charging port error. Now I can only use wireless chargers
            "
"303","The phone was better than just ""Very Good"" used. It works great and looks great. Samsung Galaxy S8 is a great phone as well.  I would recommend Chubbies to anybody that needs a new phone!
            "
"304","Came in great condition
            "
"305","Wow it's ""like new"" lol but I was worried I'm very happy with what I got!
            "
"306","Husband loves it.  He has had it for months now and it works great.
            "
"307","As an continuing Samsung customer, I have always been treated well by the devices I've bought. The S8 is a beautiful piece of work that I've become attached to and it is the best mobile device I've owned this far!
            "
"308","Can get enough of it , the camera is gorgeous, and the cpu runs smoothly.
            "
"309","nice features and great camera
            "
"310","Now is cheap when galaxy 10 is out
            "
"311","Hope I can cut through all the confusion posted here about Verizon compatibility.  THIS MODEL DOES INDEED WORK ON VERIZON'S NETWORK.  When I received the phone, I charged it to 100%, but did NOT turn it on.  I then took it to a Verizon store.  After a beat down by the salesperson for buying an unlocked phone online, she proceeded to warn me that lately, Verizon has been ""refusing to activate unlocked phones"" not purchased through them.  However, after standing my ground, the salesperson backed down, retrieved a SIM card and activated my new S8.  Be persistent!Awesome phone with wonderful features - and pretty snappy, too!  Everything is working great.  It is nice to own a phone without all the bloatware pre-installed.
            "
"312","too small for men hand.
            "
"313","Awesome phone. Always bought $100 phones as to not being on a plan. Now that I could afford it I upgraded. Couldn't be more pleased. Speakers are great. Screen is beautiful. Phone has enough weight that you dont forget it's in your lap.
            "
"314","S8 is a good phone. No complaints so far. Works as expected and goes above my expectations
            "
"315","Absolutely amazing I got this phone for my mom cuz she had a new phone from the ancient Egypt time she can't get off of it work incredible performance incredible damn good phone
            "
"316","It's a great phone, marvelous design and fast. Been almosto two weeks with it and is really great, only complain is the location of the fingerpprint reader, I guess for the S9 will fix the location.
            "
"317","Phone is great all arounder for the price. Galaxy phones do hold up well. Just found the $100 AKG headphones are faulty and the right earbud doesn't work. Pretty bummed about it as it is part of the experience as this phone still has a headphone jack
            "
"318","One word amazing
            "
"319","Great phone
            "
"320","Beautiful device. Item as described, brand new in untouched packaging. Set up was super easy, especially with the adapter to transfer data from my old phone.
            "
"321","Brand new and unopened product. The rest is on specs!
            "
"322","Item is perfect as advertised. Drove to Verizon to get a new sim card and device works flawlessly.

            "
"326","Perfect. Great phone at a great price. My unit was brand new, sealed with everything you'd expect. Also unlocked (and doesn't lock to the first Sim) this really is a great deal.
            "
"327","Not a clone. Works great
            "
"328","SIM and SD card from AT&T S3 Express inserted and Galaxy S8 Unlocked automatically initialized to existing account within minutes -- no trip to store required.  Much better $ for new phone than BstBy, etc.
            "
"329","Love it
            "
"330","It would not work. Shut off by itself. Could not turn back on.
            "
"331","Looks fine.  I saw some unboxing video from youtube which shows the box is sealed with a sticker.  But some other video doesn't have the one.  I don't understand why the manufacturer distributes different package for the same product.
            "
"332","Absolutely love this phone just received it yesterday. I am still exploring it is sleek fast,love the camera features very easy to transfer files to old phone to this one..No problems activating the device
            "
"333","Love the phone. My only complaint would be that the charger it came with died within 5 days.  :(
            "
"334","Another great phone by Samsung
            "
"335","Hi,I realized that sound of this phone automatically slow and within few seconds it turn normal. For example if you put google map in your car and hear the normal sound for map but after few mins it reduce sound automatically . Not sure if this is a bug in this product.Thanks
            "
"336","Great looking phone. The size and finish of the phone makes it easier to handle than my previous S6. The use of face recognition to unlock the phone makes a snap to open the phone. The placement of the fingerprint sensor is awkward and it should be moved to the front of the phone somehow.
            "
"337","Love this phone! Good capacity, takes great photos and videos with a variety of settings and options.
            "
"338","I was worried if it would be usable for me living in Japan, but I was able to easily get a sim card for it and it works well. It is what it said it would be so I am satisfied.
            "
"339","Great
            "
"340","Decent phone

            "
"344","Great phone great price!!!!
            "
"345","A GREAT CHOICE. Still working flawlessly
            "
"346","I had this phone for little over a year, it works like a gem. Camera quality is great so is the sound quality. Touch is up to par and side buttons work very well. I've had no problems whatsoever since I've gotten it.
            "
"347","Not easy to retrace voice mail, should have app on home page to make easy
            "
"348","Little slippery without a case given the rounded edges, but very happy with phone.
            "
"349","I'm a Samsung person, so I'm very comfortable using this phone. It is good quality (sound, image, camera, etc) and easy to use. I bought it without doing much research ahead of time, and I'm very happy with it. I recommend it.
            "
"350","I have been using this for a couple of months and it really has impressed me on what it can do.  They were so many features I discovered that I did not know even existed like dual speakers and edge lighting.  This really is the best phone you can buy.
            "
"351","From the feel of the phone, the aesthetic design to the sharp response. This phone runs tons of app concurrently without a hiccup. I highly recommend it.
            "
"352","i am having a hard time settin this up. The volume adjustment on incoming calls  is a problem.
            "
"353","Design is amazing but I put a case on anyway. Bixby is useless. I miss some sw features of the stock Android.
            "
"354","Got the phone for 550 which is a steal at this price
            "
"355","Works perfectly.  Just want I wanted.
            "
"356","New as described. Activated with Verizon with no issues, just needed SIM card. Battery life seems normal for now and will update if needed. Good buy.
            "
"357","Super duper product
            "
"358","excellent phone, good apps available, no  loss of any functionality, in fact it's better than my iphone 6 I got rid of, good camera.  Very happy owner.

            "
"376","Best phone I've had in 4 years.
            "
"377","Very good phone. I bought a factory unlocked phone, which in my opinion, is much better than a carrier (At&T or Verizon, etc) unlocked phone. None of the carrier apps and stuff is preloaded.
            "
"378","Great phone and price. Took it to Verizon and they activated it for me and transferred all my stuff into my new phone.

"387","Great price for a used S8!
            "
"388","Great phone if you like being able to run multiple apps at the same time along with all the other features it offers. So good I bought 2 at the same time cuz I wanted to enjoy it twice as much.

"394","Item is fine a bit too pricey but we got a good working product no problems so far.
            "

"397","Great phone. Haven't found anything I don't like yet.
            "
"398","Overall there isn't really anything bad about the phone, the camera and the screen are sharp and crisp. Also, the screen wasn't as small as I thought it was.
            "
"399","Phone sucks! I'm sending it back and I want a full refund! The phone wouldn't sync with my SIM card. I even took it to AT&T and they put a knew SIM in it. Still didn't work!

"417","The screen, camera, and overall build are phenomenal.The Samsung version of Android is complete crap. The only version of Android that should be put on flagships is the pure version, plain and simple. Why does Samsung still have a proprietary app for everything Google already does so well? Then I have to tell the phone that I want to use the Google version for every default app. Don't even get me started about the fact that Facebook is preinstalled and CAN'T BE UNINSTALLED. I don't even have a Facebook account.. You can't remap the Bixby button to Google Assistant without a third party app? I simply disabled it to prevent myself from accidentally opening that crap assistant. The software for a 2017 flagship is atrocious.One of the selling points of this phone for me was the SD card expansion option. I bought a 128 GB SD card and downloaded all my Spotify music for offline use and all was good. Until one day, about 2 weeks into owning the phone, the SD card reader simply stopped working. After checking out some forums I realized this is an issue that Samsung won't address. This was the straw that broke the camel's back and I couldn't forgive Samsung for all the things I didn't like about the phone. I sent it back within 2 weeks of owning it.If you want a pure Android experience with great hardware, this is not the phone for you. If you're switching from an iOS device, or simply aren't into customizing your experience AND you don't mind not having advertised SD card support, go for it.

Well with this phone you can't do any of those things. Don't believe me? Google it there are plenty of forums that say there are no fixes for these problems. A more recent problem I've discovered is if you're listening to music the music will just stop playing until you unplug and replug the headphones in.

"516","This is a great phone. It does most of what it's supposed to and is a huge upgrade from my S6. Took one star away since it advertises use of the fingerprint scanner as a means to take pictures with the front facing camera. It doesn't work. I called Samsung support many times and even got a replacement phone. Still didn't work. Face recognition doesn't work particularly well either. Iris scan is a better option and that works nicely.Not the phone's fault, but getting this thing from Amazon was a nightmare. Now I have to return the second one they sent out because it's no better than the first and actually a little worse in some ways (home button not as receptive, Bixby button finicky, and still no fingerprint shooting method). Still happy with my choice, but 3 stars seems appropriate.

"542","It really is a beautiful phone, and probably in the best family of phones out there.The Good:It looks amazing on the back and the screen. The curved display is very nice and only adds to the looks of the phone. The camera is epic and surprises me at every corner. The processing power is of course epic. Being able to record your heartrate, stress level and blood O2 level is nice.The Bad:For some reason you cannot change the notification sound, which is simply dumb. And you also cannot change what is on your lock screen, such as removing the clock, which is restricting.What I recommend is that if you want a new-ish phone, and don't want to play an absurd amount of money, watch the price of this phone until it is around 470$ and then buy it.

"557","This phone has great capabilities and sleek design. Even though I purchased the Otterbox screen protector, I couldn't put it on and have the phone still work. As a result, when my phone was accidentally knocked off a stand that was about 18 inches off the floor, the screen cracked. Now I'm getting flashing lights and I will have to replace the screen for $230. I've owned the phone for less than 4 months and it is already almost useless because of the crack that keeps spreading and the flashing light. This phone is extremely fragile and for the price, definitely not worth it.
            "

"559","Great phone, great deal!!!
            "
"560","This was the worst purchase I can recall making. Run, don't walk, away from this thing. The Android platform is what it is, and if you're looking in this space you are already OK with it vis a vis the IPhone. The real problem is the casing. It is absurdly delicate, and the screen is so configured that it presents a fragile curved glass edge rather than a hard plastic rim. While this feature no doubt increases screen capacity, it means that there is a very high likelihood you will break the screen with ordinary use. To this day I'm not sure how I broke mine. Once you do that, you are in a world of pain. You can't get screens from Samsung as an end user, and if you go through an approved repair facility you are in for a wait of a month or so, and a total cost to repair of roughly half of what you paid for the phone. Meanwhile, you don't have a phone. Handy. If I could go back in time and pay money to avoid making the mistake of getting this thing, I would gladly do it. As it stands, I am probably going to write it off and get an IPhone, from which I mistakenly switched in the first place.
            "
"561","Update:  New phone has arrived and is working great. Five starts for Amazon customer service,  4 stars for the phone(the first one was defective but if not for that, would be five stars)Like the phone while its working, seems to be quick and the pictures seem really nice,  I'm unfortunately one of the ones that have been affected by the constant restarting problem.  Two stars for now since Amazon customer service is replacing it,  once the new one gets here and it doesnt have the restarting problem(restarts at random 15-20 times a day) I'll update the score/review.

Nice display, quick function, just a bit of a challenge to navigate around the phone. Imbedded apps are a pain, and slow the phone down. Google got it right with their Pixel 2. Aftermarket products are hit-or-miss for the S8, as many cases for this aren't very snug-fitting. READ the reviews for cases and accessories. Some really suck.

"574","1. I was using it fine. One day failed to start. 2. Sent in for repair on 8/18/18. 3. Just got it back on 8/31/18. 4. Samsung did not fix it. The letter came with the phone said simply, ""unable to fix"" 5. Called Samsung. Was on hold for 32 min. After several transfers, I was told there was a liquid damage. 6. How can there be a liquid damage when it never went near water? 7. Isn't Samsung Galaxy S8 water resistant to begin with? 8. It took Samsung over 10 days to determine that there is a water damage? 9. I have had many Samsung products in the past. I have to confess it will take a lot for me to consider Samsung again.
            "
"575","Boss!!!
            "
"576","I had high hope for Samsung's flagship phone, but was very disappointed.The positives:1.  The phone has a headphone jack, an SD Card slot, and wireless charging.2.  The phone is unlocked and has the transmitters necessary to work on all four U.S. carriers.3.  The Wireless Hotspot feature works even if you don't pay your carrier for the privilege.4.  The Screen is sharp and bright, just like prior Galaxy phones.The negatives:1.  No hard button on the front.  I really appreciated that the earlier Galaxy phones that had a physical button.  I like the tactile feedback that a physical button gives you.  It allows you to wake your phone without having to look at it to make sure your hand is in the right place.  That tactile feedback is missing on this phone.  Also, on this phone, to wake the phone you must press the virtual button TWICE, then you must swipe, and then you must type in your passcode/PIN.  That means a total of FOUR actions just to get the phone to the home screen.  That's just stupid.2.  No user replaceable battery.  This is simply inexcusable.  I know that they big companies want you to throw away your phone every two years and buy a new one, but that is incredibly wasteful and unnecessary.  There is nothing about the design of this phone that mandates a battery that cannot be replaced by the user.  It would have been very easy to design the phone to have a user removable rear cover.  Even wireless charging can be accomplished with a user replaceable battery.  I had wireless charging on my Galaxy S3 and S4, both of which had a user replaceable battery.3.  Oddly sized:  This phone is too tall and too narrow.  As a result, it does not easily fit into my pocket and will fall out fairly easily as well.4.  Oddly shaped:  The waterfall feature on the screen has an appeal that's similar to the appeal of curved TV sets.  Initially, it looks interesting, but you quickly come to realize that it heightens glare and distorts the image.  In the case of this waterfall screen, it distorts the images at the edges.  It also makes it almost impossible to get a case that will protect the phone from screen damage when it is dropped.5.  Bixby Button:  Bixby is a Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri.  There's a dedicated Bixby button, which is located directly across from the power button, which makes it super easy to inadvertently push when you're pushing the power button.  Samsung just recently made it possible to disable, but not remap, the button.  But, in order to do so, you *must* create a Samsung account, share some personal information with Samsung, and link Bixby to the account.  Until you do that, you cannot get to the screen that allows you to disable the button.  Again, this is stupid.  If Bixby is so great, people will choose to use it.  Samsung shouldn't need to force people to do so.In the end, even though I got a smoking $574 Black Friday price on this phone from Amazon.com, I'm going to send it back and either keep my S6, or upgrade to S7 instead.
            "
"577","The phone was sold to me as 'new' but it experienced Black Screen of Death from which I was not able to recover immediately after installing.
            "
"578","The Galaxy itself is fantastic. I love the picture quality, which is most important to me. Apps and customization are also fantastic. Another really important feature to me, as a data hoarder, is the SD card slot.Just be careful whenever you purchase one off Amazon, my carrier worked out but I didn't get a warranty as described.
            "
"579","There is NO IR Blaster!!!! Seriously, why this hardware was not included in the S8 is beyond me. Rediculous! This hardware has been included in cellphones for YEARSSS and has been included in Samsung Galaxy cellphones since the S4!!! Smh. This was not a feature I thought I needed to research. I have utilized the IR blaster in all my previous cellphones to control electronics at work and at home, TVs and Air Conditions mostly, and I am incredibly disappointed to find out, after buying an S8, that it is not built into this phone.

"580","It's a nice phone only problem I have is the HD Voice, WiFi Calling, and VoLTE(Voice over LTE) (the feature that allows you to use data and Voice at the same time doesn't work) but I love it I'm hoping this will change when I receive my replacement unit but I love it! And I love Amazon! They have really impressed me! Kudos to Samsung and Amazon!

"581","I've been getting Samsung phones since the Galaxy S1. But when I got this phone the Bixby feature was a minor problem. After a month its gotten even more annoying the fact Bixby would come up and whats worse, is we can NOT reprogram or disable that button. Later on I realized there was a lot of other crap-ware Samsung was forcing on us that would popup up as well. The worst was when I wanted to take a video and yours truly Bixby vision came up and I missed the shot. There are other problems but all were minor what bothers me is the amount of small problems. Unless in the next Galaxy Samsung stops forcing crap-ware onto their phones this is the last Samsung phone I would ever get.

"583","I set it up one day one. On day two it started with a screen that was locked in with the message it was not connected . To give feed back or close it. It would let me do neither. Screen was locked. Could not power off or restart as tyhe message was over the icons to do it . I have a samsung five and t6hat I love. Would avoid the 8

            "
"585","Despite reviews, the camera is not very good. Specifically, the native dynamic range is very limited, and the HDR feature seems to be faked in software (with poor results) as opposed to ""real"" HDR where multiple images are captured at different exposures and blended together into one.When shooting at night, areas around light bulbs are bleached. When shooting during the day in contrasty scenes, the blue sky is bleached white, even with the HDR mode on.My 2014 iPhone 6 plus does not have a problem capturing the dynamic range of these scenes without bleaching, and takes much better overall pictures (despite the lower pixel count) because it has real HDR that works well.I even tried a 3rd party true HDR camera app. But, in the darkest exposure setting the areas around light bulbs at night are bleached. Basically, the camera's hardware just doesn't have the range to do it.Also, the camera has awful halo effects at night, regardless of whether I use the stock camera app or the paid premium one. Streetlights, etc. have horizontal lines that run across the screen from end to end.I am thinking of getting rid of this brand new phone because the camera is so sub-par compared to my past iPhones. In fact, my iPhone 4S has a preferable camera in some ways because it does HDR properly.The 1080p video is also inferior to my 2014 iPhone 6 plus. There is a notable lack of detail and contrast in the videos. While it is encoded as 1080p, apparently due to compression artifacts or whatnot, there is a notable loss of detail that makes the result look like a good 480p shoot.And the audio for video, while fairly good, is also inferior to the 2014 Apple model. This is quite apparent when shooting at a concert.And, the S8 chews through battery rapidly, even with almost all app push notifications and auto updates turned off, and even with the phone in the middle battery saving mode with the processor and display throttled back. I couldn't get through a day in an amusement park without running out of battery.Lastly, while the OLED screen has stunning brightness and color gamut, the color accuracy is notably off. I found this to be occasionally irritating when watching movies, and it prevented me from accurately adjusting photos with photo editing apps.The phone is quite nice looking, and the iris scanner works better than I expected. The front facing camera the best I've yet seen. The cellular reception is slightly better than my old phone - i will get 1 bar in some places where I used to get ""no service.""Good phone all in all, but the camera flaws are a dealbreaker for me.

"640","The phone is fine. Exactly what Samsung says it is. Here's what makes it awful. Carriers will not offer coverage for full service area to an unlocked phone not purchased through them. The charges for service are the same, but the service area is limited, making an independent purchase a bad decision. Carriers say it is a chip issue. That's a lie. It is a very easy thing to provide complete coverage for all customers regardless of their phones.

"642","I don't normally write review but Im abit disappointed that I feel like Im getting an Open Box item while I purchased the NEW condition item. There is no plastic wrap around the phone, it does look used; the package didn't deliver on time and there is no bubble bag to protect the item during delivery. Anyway, after I finish setup everything on the phone; I pulled out the headphone that comes with it to test - the volume adjustment is messed up. it doesn't work correctly. the lower button didn't work at all. I would have return this item if I didn't spend 3 - 4 hours setting up and messing around with it. I paid the full price and expecting a brand new phone.

Never submerged it in water, besides light dampening from getting caught in the rain, moisture that other Samsung phones that I have owned that do not claim to have any water-resistance withstood. Had a top of the line phone case from day 1 with no hard falls within last 1-2 months. Bought this phone new, however, it is not covered by any warranty as I am not in the USA. VERY DISAPPOINTED...BUYER BEWARE!

"648","It's awesome
            "
"649","Just an average phone. The selling point being that it's an ""edge"" is kinda pointless being that most cases cover up around the edges. Gets in the way of some video formats, covering the bar. And the screen protector helps but because of the ""Edge"" it leaves the sides exposed. Now the case will cover it as I said, however it will also slowly peel the Screen protector off. And believe me you are gonna need that case. All the protection you can get. Had a foot drop, not only do I have a cracked screen but an actual hole. Waterproof selling point out the window. With such a high maintenance phone, idk why you would have it near water in the first place. Had this for a few weeks, battery was great until recently,  drains more quickly now. Damn ridiculous. (Update: beside battery continues to diminish it total life span, now having trouble shooting and storing photos. They become corrupted) I'm done with this phone, should of given LG a chance.

"672","I am a long time Galaxy user.  My whole family and I have had Samsung Galaxies since the S3.  But this S8 annoys me to no end.  They are turning the Galaxy into an iPhone.  If I wanted form over function, silly proprietary annoyances just for the sake of an advertising image -- well, I would have bought an iPhone.  But I didn't.Battery:  I have had this S8 for 9 weeks now.  I cannot make it through the day without the phone dying.  That's bad enough.  But far, far worse is the fact that the battery cannot be changed. Lack of interchangeable batteries has long been the Achilles heel of iPhones.  iPhone users constantly complain about it.  So what does Samsung do?  Make a new model with a sealed, non-changeable battery.  So I guess we're supposed to just throw our $750 phone away once the battery goes bad. If all the other Galaxies has interchangeable batteries, and all us users loved it, why would you even consider removing that much-loved feature?  And don't tell me for waterproofing.  I don't care.  You should be able to figure that out.All-Glass Case:  Are you kidding me?  If you look at the phone wrong, it will break.  And it's unbelievably slippery.  Nice combination -- slippery, made of breakable glass, front and back.  People are breaking their phones between the time they get it at the T-Mobile store and the time Amazon Prime can deliver a protective case. And even with a case, it'll break. I mean come on, the whole thing is made of glass.  Of course it's going to break.Proprietary charging port:  The Galaxy S5 had a USB 3.0.  That was genius, seriously.  The S5 was universally compatible -- including backwards compatible with USB 2.0, which means practically every charging cable in the world could be used to charge it.  In addition, USB 3.0 is super fast for data transfers.  So, what does Samsung do?  Create a new, proprietary cable connection that doesn't exist anywhere else on any piece of technology ever invented.  What a great idea -- let's turn the best charging system into the worst.  And that's even worse than Apple.  iPhones are known for their unusable proprietary features, but at least there are lots of different iPhones that use their proprietary cable.  In this case, only the S8 uses this useless connection.Infinity Display:  Samsung touts the ""uninterrupted surface that flows seamlessly over the edges"".  Okay, one question.  Did anyone actually hold this phone in their hand before bringing it to market?  Because if they had, they would know that your hand cannot hold the phone without touching the ""seamless edges."" Obviously.  So, various parts of your hand are constantly interfering with the function of the phone. So, just holding the phone, my hand is constantly fighting with my fingers for control of the phone.  I'd like to know -- who was asking for their phone to be turned into an infinity pool?  In case someone from Samsung is reading this, let me answer the rhetorical question: NO ONE.  No one cares that their phone wraps around the edge if it interferes with the operation of the phone.In other words -- form over function.  Give me a phone that works well over some gimmicky new change that no one cares about anyway.  Stop copying Apple, and bring back a real Samsung Galaxy.
            "

            "
"676","Excellent phone.  The only three things keeping me from giving this a 5 star rating are:1) No replaceable battery.  If the phone locks up you have to hope holding down the down and power buttons will interrupt the phone and force a reset.  Also, when the battery will no longer hold a charge you are SOL (And this will happen sooner or later...it will force you to buy a new expensive phone even if a new battery would fix the issue at a much reduced cost).2) Bixby...just plain annoying!  The button is in an awkward location and when you hold the phone horizontally it causes Bixby to turn on unless you stretch your hand/fingers into awkward locations.3) Curved glass.  While this looks sleek and ""sexy"" it is kinda annoying.  If somebody is standing anywhere near you they can see what is going on on your phone.  Also makes screen protectors a lot more expensive and elaborate.Can't argue much with the price though, much cheaper here on Amazon than anywhere else.

            "
"678","Pretty cool
            "
"679","There is a lot of great about this phone and that's why it's so maddening that samsung seems to go out of their way to want to irritate you and cripple it.  I just had my greatest of all time S5 crap out.  It was getting unreliable after 4 years and anker stopped making its amazing Godzilla battery for it.  From its hay day the only thing it needed an upgrade on was its camera and be touch bigger.  It was fast enough, a good size expandable memory and number 1 it could have an expanded battery.WHY DID SAMSUNG TAKE AWAY THE REMOVABLE BATTERY FEATURE!  Me and everyone I know think this is beyond stupid.  To the point of not trusting the company at all.  Like a car company that has en engine that can run on its own solar panel but makes the car where it can only have square wheels.  Why do something ao stupid.  I read the reviews for years where the idiot press commented about the ""cheap feeling"" plastic back.  And mabe samsung took it to heart.  Plastic is light, flexable , removable and can bounce a bit when dropped or can be replaceable.  I with the screen could be plastic too.So what to they do.  Make the back glass too?  So smart.  Let's take my expensive portable  electronics and make it more breakable, heavy and slippery!!!!  WTH?  I cant even shop for a case bafore it falls out of my pocket from 2.5 ft high and dents the charging port and cracks the back glass.Glass?  Why use glass? Everyone is going to put it in a case anyway and now doubly so. So why even bother with glass?  And why cripple the battery capability.  I'll be getting a battery case for mine and now I'll have to manage 2 batteries as they charge and discharge each other and wear each other both out.Next is the form factor.  Are we making the std form factor for 9 yr old girls now?  Is that the new marketing sweet spot?  Make the phone bigger but also less useful at the same time.  What aspect ratio is this thing?  Samsung, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.3rd.  Rounded screen edges.  Show me the customer who said ""wow good phone but can we distort the edges more and make it so I accidentally press commands while I hold it.""4th is Bixby.  Yes we needed Google now to extend into the apps more and get more granular so why not build on Google now?  Because the basic Bixby sucks.  It can't get a command right.  And even after correcting it 4 times still can't recognise my town name.  But they added a whole special extra button for that junk pile.  Take away the home button but add a special bixby button, Thanks.Now to just wait for the inevitable moment where I need to do a battery pull for a reboot.Competitors take note.  Make a rugged expandable, practical smart phone and you will collect a very loyal market segment.  Give us a 2 or 4 or even a 6X sized battery.  Let us switch between.  How about an internal micro sd and an external to pop in and out. How about a charging port and an HDMI or dual combos for when the first charging port wears out.  We dont care that its octo core or has trillion by bazillion screen rez.  Just make a phone good enough, useful enough and tough enough to be useful everyday.

"685","Product was a lemon, within a week out of the box developed touchscreen problems. Contacted samsung technical support and was told the only recourse I had was to ship the device out to some nebulous repair facility for approximately 1 month. Was acknowledged as a defect yet would still not exchange device for a functional unit without a 1 month turnaround.I have used galaxy devices from S3-S6 and after this will never purchase another samsung electronic of any variety.

"686","I feel the need to warn people--do not buy this phone. I have been a lifelong Samsung Galaxy customer and was very excited when I got my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge about a year and a half ago. This phone is a hunk of junk and Samsung is wrong to continue selling it. Do your research (on help forums not websites selling the product) and you will see that there  are a myriad of common problems such as pixel failure, complete screen failure, SD card corruption--the list goes on. My problems began about three months in to having the phone. So much money was spent on it that I'm stuck with it for the foreseeable future. Samsung continues to deny responsibility for these faulty devices and will not send replacements or issue refunds. I bought mine through T-Mobile and because I'd previously had great experiences with Samsung Galaxy products, did not opt-in to purchase the warranty. I took the phone in to an independent electronics service center several months ago and had them replace the screen on the device for $390. This took care of the notorious ""pink line"" these phones get across the screen inditing an impending complete screen failure for about six weeks. The line returned in all it's obnoxious and infuriating glory. Again, I could go on endlessly with other complaints--but trust me you and anyone who glances at your phone won't be able to ignore the screen problem.I will not be buying a Samsung product again.

"687","It gets stuck. Have to  force restart frequently.
            "
"688","I'm going to start out this review by stating that I have basically hated the Galaxy S phones since they've come out.  I loved my old Samsung flip phone, but when they made the move to Android, I just couldn't get into them.  I read how amazing the Super AMOLED screen was, and I thought it was garbage.  It was grainy and the colors were much too garish and off.  The UI was cartoony and had weird colors.  Over the years, though, Samsung slowly stripped away the bloat, refined their screens, cleaned up their Android skin, and after all this time I can finally say that they've sold me.The feel:The first thing I noticed with this phone was how amazing it feels.  It's crazy thin, and encased in cool, smooth curved glass.  It has just the right amount of heft to make it feel premium.  It feels like a smooth, elegant and flat pebble.  With the infinity screen it (and its brothers the S8+ and Note 8) is easily the most attractive phone I've ever seen, a departure from the older Galaxy S phones which had never struck an aesthetic note with me.While the elongated shape of the phone seems odd at first, and actually makes the screen more narrow than other flagships, it works well for accessing the entire screen with one hand.  While it's still a stretch, it's more managable that way and makes the new on-screen navigation keys less obtrusive.  Speaking of the on-screen keys, I've never been a fan until now.  They work well and the home ""button"" even has a vibrating ""click"" when you press it in, which I like for turning on your screen and unlocking it in one shot.The physical buttons are a bit too easy to accidentally press, which I don't like, and the Bixby button (which I'll get to later) is unnecessary and makes the volume keys harder to find.As much as I like the design, this phone NEEDS a case.  I don't mean that as a bad thing, although for some people I'm sure it will be.  It's delicate.  The all-glass design makes it highly vulnerable to breaking, as you'll find reading reviews and watching drop tests.  The edge display detects accidental touches on occasion.  The volume keys are too clicky.  The phone is thin and smooth which makes it too easy to drop.  A case solves all of these problems.  Even if I didn't work in construction (which I do), I would put a case on this phone.  I personally went with the Spigen Rugged Armor<U+00A0>Samsung Galaxy S8 Case, Spigen¢ç [Rugged Armor] Galaxy S8 Case Cover with Resilient Shock Absorption and Carbon Fiber Design for Galaxy S8 (2017) - Black- 565CS21609<U+00A0>case, which I highly recommend.  There's even a Youtube video where a guy drops it on tile floor and it just bounces, with no damage whatsoever.Software:For years Samsung's TouchWiz was bloated and ugly.  I hated the cartoony look and the garish colors (which were made worse by the extreme oversaturation of the Super AMOLED screen).  But now, with the paring down of bloat, it's finally become useable.  A while back Samsung also introduced a theme engine into their phones and I'm glad they did.  I was able to change all of the default Samsung apps and menus into the black shades that I love so much.  You can even replace the icons with a different themes, although I ended up using Nova Launcher with some icons I had bought for it.I like the way Samsung has set up their apps.  They are clean, usable, intuitive, but still full of handy features.  Probably my least favorite is the Gallery, although my complaints are minor.  My issue is that the pictures are all clumped into a giant, solid wall of pictures, which makes it difficult to differentiate between each file.  The little overlays that tell you if it's a video or a photo, etc. are in plain white text that sometimes is hard to read against lighter pictures.  But the email app, dialer, calendar, system menus, etc. are all a pleasure to use.  Everything runs fast and I even found myself using the split screen feature for the first time ever (I had to do some calculator work and type numbers into a spreadsheet) which impressed me.There is still bloat though.  Samsung has a bunch of redundant features that mirror those of Google's, which aggravates me.  It would be fine if I planned on sticking to the Samsung phone ecosystem for the rest of my life, but I'm not even close to making that commitment.  I still use all of Google's services, because I can use them on any Android phone.  You get Samsung Calendars, Samsung Health, Samsung Pay (which I'll elaborate more on), Samsung backup, and others.  It's mostly not a chore to use Google's features instead, but you really need to pay attention on things like the calendars and contacts to make sure you're using their Google equivilants.To be honest I didn't even try Bixby.  Google Assistant is more than I need, and I don't like having an extra home screen or a button specifically for Samsung's digital assistant.  Fortunately you can completely disable both the button and the service, but you have to fully enable it and set it up before you can do that.  The button is not capable of being set for anything else, so if you disable Bixby you basically end up with a useless button on the side of your phone.The Galaxy S8 has the infinity edge screen so that means it comes with the Edge shortcuts.  This is a menu you can slide out from the side of your screen and run apps, call contacts, etc. with.  There are actually a ton of extra features and screens you can download for it, but in the end I didn't see the need for one more thing on my screen.  That being said, I think that if a person set it up and used it regularly, it may become a handy feature.Samsung Pay is a feature I was surprised by.  My phone came with a promotional $50 credit via Samsung Pay so I was obligated to use it.  The first time I tried it, it was just like in the commercial: the cashier assured me that they couldn't do it, and she clumsily fumbled with the card scanner trying to figure out just how it was going to happen.  I calmly reached over and waved my phone over the reader, and like magic, it accepted payment.  I got a receipt on my phone and happily went on my way.  I've used it three times total, and the first two times it worked, but the third it failed even though the reader specifically said it worked with Samsung Pay.  As cool as the first two times were, I didn't appreciate looking like a fool while I waved my phone around a card reader like an idiot.Hardware:Another feature I was surprised by was the fingerprint reader.  I found myself using it in my money apps, which makes them much simpler.  It's very quick and let me log into my Wells Fargo and Paypal apps instantly, which is convenient for checking balances, sending payments, etc.  Yes, the reader has a terrible location next to the camera.  However, this is another feature that is fixed by putting a case on your phone.  Once you have a cutout for the camera, your finger can easily find the edge of the hole where the reader lies, making it essentially a non-issue.Battery life so far has been great.  This is the seventh Android phone I've owned, and I don't recall any of them getting phenomenal battery life.  My galaxy S5 I briefly owned (used, to replace an LG G3 with a cracked screen) got terrible life but that could have been other factors.  This one gets me through a full work day with moderate social media use, and in today's world that's the most I hope for from a cell phone.  I do have to put it on the charger in the evening, but only briefly and then it gets me through bedtime.  The battery is not removable however so keep that in mind.I've never tried wireless charging before, but I did with this phone simply because the chargers are cheap and easily available, and I had to buy new cables anyway for the new USB C standard, so I snagged a wireless charger from Amazon.  I didn't use the Samsung charger or cable so I'm sure it could have been faster, but in about 4 hours it filled up the battery from almost dead.  This works well for me for charging overnight, but you can't use your phone while it's lying on the pad so it might not be great for other uses.Call quality has been wonderful.  The volume of the ear speaker is actually more than I need, which is a good thing.  I'd rather turn the audio volume down on a call then top it out and wish it would go louder.  The external speaker is adequate, not being overly quiet but not really sounding impressive in any way.  I didn't get any complaints on speakerphone mode.The screen almost needs its own catagory.  As I stated, for years I've hated Super AMOLED.  I don't get how people thought the early screens looked good.  The saturation was so high, and the colors were off, so that when the brightness was up (and these displays are bright) it made my eyes bleed.  But finally, with this phone, I feel that the colors and saturation are perfect.  The screen is super bright too, and in fact Samsung's auto-brightening technology learns what setting you use at different light levels, making this the first Android phone I've ever had auto-brightness turned on with.  The resolution is actually turned down when you buy the phone, which I recommend not messing with.  You can turn it up to 4k, but it's not needed and the battery will be drained more quickly.  As it is, pictures and text are extremely clear.  Everything just looks so great on this screen, I find myself staring at it sometimes just to admire it.  The infinity edge feels good too, giving it a nice rolled over feel when you swipe towards the sides.  The phone has a feature called always on display, which leaves the clock, battery percentage, and little notification icons on your screen even when it's locked.  The brightness is turned down so that you don't get screen burn-in, and I found that I liked this feature, which didn't seem to affect battery drain.The camera is one of the reasons I bought this phone.  I've heard for a few years now that Apple and Samsung cameras are always neck and neck in quality.  In practice, I'm mostly happy with my choice.  In well lit conditions pictures come out wonderful.  Colors are great and they've very clear.  Burst shots are amazing, shooting literally 60 pictures in about a second.  Low light shots were a mixed bag, though.  The lighting in the pictures is definitely brighter than in real life, which is great, but for whatever reason once you hit a certain threshold the colors become washed out and any movement at all causes blurring.  This is a problem common to cameras and is related to aperture and shutter speed, but I honestly expected this phone camera to do better.  Perhaps it's a setting I need to enable, but as of right now I was a little disappointed.  However, if this phone camera is near the top of the heap, I suppose I don't have much choice but to accept it.Summary:I know this has been a long-winded review but a phone is a major purchase in a person's life and I feel like I needed to share my full experience to buyers.Overall I love this phone.  There are no major issues with it and using it is a joy.  I'm sure it's partly the new phone effect, but I find myself trying to come up with reasons to use it so I can enjoy the beautiful screen and snappy performance.  It has a few minor flaws here and there, and a bit of the obligatory Samsung bloat, but so far it's been a wonderful experience.  I would highly recommend it.

"691","This phone is very fragile, I accidentally dropped it 1 ft high and it broke in 3 different places. It is tough to find a good screen protector that protects the phone and not degrade screen sensitivity. The setting to increase touch sensitivity which was available in the S5 is now gone so there is no way around this problem. The thoughtless design of this phone will not allow you to solve this problem. Either add a ballistic glass protector to the screen which solves the fragility of this phone but turns it into a useless phone since you have to press really hard to get the screen to respond, or not add a glass screen protector which leaves this phone subject to breaking sooner or later. It is as if Samsung intentionally designed the phone so that the screen will break (so they can sell more $200 'gorilla' glass screen'?) Other gimmicks are the 'Bixby' app which pops up constantly if you swipe the phone unintentionally in the wrong direction, and the edge screen which accidentally activates some menus while holding it. So you will have to try to hold this slippery phone by avoiding the front edges which increases the chance of dropping and breaking it.

"694","This is a great phone in terms of its power and UI... Pretty much any phone in this price point is going to be amazing, and it definitely fits the bill in terms of specs and performance.However, it is probably the most fragile phone ever made.  I have never broken a phone in my life, and I drop my phone as much as the next person.  You can tell the second you hold this phone that it is amazingly fragile.  The whole thing is made of Gorilla glass, which is known to spider crack extremely easily.  Crazy that this design was actually approved, I don't care how strong you think your glass is it will never be more durable than metal/plastic.  Any benefits are overshadowed by the fact this is the most fragile phone ever to hit the market.The design of the phone makes it way easier for it to slip out of your pocket.  I can't ever remember having my phone fall out of my pocket (I am sure it has happened, but nothing became of it IE breaks), but I had to constantly be aware of my phone in my pocket/take it out and put it on the table because when I sat it immediately started to slip out.  I think it is because this phone is larger vertically and smaller horizontally compared to most phones.  I have owned many phones, and this has never been a problem until the moment I put this phone in my pocket.My phone fell out of my pocket while sitting, it was a drop between 2 and 2.5 feet, and it cracked in 2 corners, one corner that was not even apart of the initial impact.  The fact a corner that had no major impact whatsoever (a fall of maybe 4 inches after the first corning hit the ground) cracked was alarming to say the least.  Shame on me for not having the case on it (I literally had the phone for 3 hours, did not make it home yet and my case I purchased was at home)...  However, few weeks later it slipped out again, with a case on, and the whole front of the phone shattered.... Again a drop no more than 2.5 feet.Insurance on this phone is an absolutely must, or I guarantee you will not own this phone in a working fashion very long.  My S5 fell 2 stories and didn't get a scratch. This phone fell 2 feet and spider cracked to a point where I need to get it repaired.  One of the most important aspects of a cell phone is its durability and ability to handle everyday life and people where accidents happen at one point or another is guaranteed.  The fact you have to treat this phone with the delicacy of an infant makes it almost a burden to own.Between the failings of the S7 and the beyond poor durability of the S8, this lifelong Android user may switch to Iphone my next phone purchase a few years down the line
            "
"695","I have had this phone for about 5 months now. Now I have owned the S4, Note 4 and now the S8. Samsung is notorious for lag after some months of use. As a previous Samsung phone owner I took some steps to try and mitigate any lag as best I could. I install AVG Cleaner and consistently let it run to clean my device of any unnecessary junk. I reboot it at least once a week! I clear it's ram and delete any background memory hogs that might slow it down. Despite this it has managed to lock up on me at least twice in the 5 months that I can remember and self reboot. There is still some latency but overall it has been pretty responsive. Given the option to purchase it again now that I have had it for 5 months I can't say I would have made another choice. After 5 months it's still a solid phone and in my opinion one of the best phones available as of writing this review.  When I was looking for a new phone to buy 5 months ago I was seriously considering leaving the Samsung line, I was fed up with their notorious lag and wanted something more stable. On the day I decided to buy the phone Samsung had the best deal out. I am glad I waited a while and didn't buy it as soon as it hit the shelves. The price dropped and it came with two free gifts!Verdict... Great phone! Not perfect!  but... Just Great!
            "
"696","I purchased my Galaxy S8 from the Samsung site only because they gave me $200 for my old phone (Galaxy S5). I was hesitant at first, given some of the negative reviews here and also elsewhere on the web. I have now owned the phone for over a month, here are my impressions.1. Red screen: This was one of my main concerns, since many people seem to have received phones with red screens. The phone does have a setting that is called ""blue light filter"", which I find awesome because it tends to protect your eyes from the damage these screens cause especially when used in the dark. With this setting turned on, the colors do tend to look reddish at first, but you quickly get used to it. Otherwise, you can turn it off and the colors of the screen are simply amazing. So I had absolutely no issues here. The screen resolution and size are exceptional.2. Fingerprint scanner: It's on the back of the phone, right next to the camera. At first, I'll admit it was a bit inconvenient, since I had some trouble putting my finger on the scanner rather than the camera. However, the minute I got a case for the phone, this stopped being an issue, since the case border is useful as a guide to put my finger in the right spot. At this point, the scanner is great, it easily recognizes the fingers I have registered and is many times better and faster than the one I had in my prior phone. I am 100% used to it now and even look for the scanner in the back whenever I hold a different phone. So again, no issues here, even if there are a ton of reviews saying that people can never ever get used to it. I actually like the location of the scanner now.3. Size: I had a Galaxy S5, which had a 5.1"" screen. This one has a 5.8"" screen and feels much better. The S8 feels long at first but the dimensions ""make sense"" and you quickly get used to it. There's even an advantage here: I normally carry my phone in my front pants pocket and since the S8 a bit longer I can grab it more easily than I did the S5. I have found the S8 much more comfortable than the S8+ both to carry and to hold, and I haven't missed the extra half inch that the S8+ has.4. Hardware and performance: This is a top-of-the-line phone and I have had absolutely no issues with lag, freezing, quality, or anything I can think of. Videos look amazing, the camera and the camera software are quite more advanced than I am as a user, the sound from the speaker is missing nothing, and the sensors (iris, heartbeat, light, focus and so on) all work perfectly. The phone also comes standard with AKG headphones and they are by far the best I've had, both in sound quality and in the materials used, I feel like they will last for a long time. I also had a problem at first with things like the edge bar getting in the way whenever I was playing a game, but it was a user error: the phone comes with game mode, which easily and quickly hides the edge bar while in a game, so it doesn't get in the way, and the minute you leave the game the edge bar is back on its own. I bought the phone in Coral Blue and the phone color is very attractive.5. Some things I do not like (note: all these things are minor issues for me, that's why I gave the phone 5 stars):5A) Sometimes I don't get notification sounds if, for example, I receive a message after several hours of not receiving one (in the mornings, for example). I just notice that the notification is there all of a sudden. I have tested this and it in fact happes with several apps. I'm sure this will have an easy fix with a software update, but for now I cannot trust notification sounds 100%. Note: this is only true of the sound, the notifications do appear correctly all the time.5B) Like I said before, the headphones are absolutely great. However, they have a quite sturdy and long cover for the jack, and using the phone in landscape mode with the headphones connected is a bit uncomfortable since the cover gets in the way quite a bit. This is inconvenient but by no means a huge issue.5C) Bixby is still very limited, but the phone comes with Google Assistant, which I have found even better than Siri at times. I would just prefer that the physical Bixby button could be configured to use with Google Assistant. It's also a minor issue, since I can always press and hold the home button and get Google Assistant just as easily.5D) There are some web pages where, if you're watching a video in landscape mode and then turn to portrait, the video will not resize. This can be solved by hitting the back button but it's inconvenient. Note: I found that this is true also for the iPhone 8 that my buddy has. Also note: this happens only in *some* pages, most of them work fine.5E) I was surprised at first to learn that there were no tempered glass screen protectors at the Samsung store for this phone. Then it made more sense, since the screen shape does not allow for a good protector. I have bought a couple of relatively inexpensive ones but they don't quite fit the phone or get loose very quickly. I would recommend that you save your money and don't buy any of those off-brand screen protectors for this phone, they won't work. I would prefer to have a screen protector for this phone but I can't have one, unless it's the plastic one Samsung sells.6. In summary: The phone has an extremely attractive design and mine gets noticed quite a bit, so socially it's great. It's also an impressive piece of hardware, so when I'm alone I also enjoy it quite a bit. I have been told that my voice sounds clearer to the other person when I'm in a call since I have had this phone; I can also say that I can hear the other person much more clearly in this phone. The camera is outstanding, the sound and video quality are impressive, and the phone itself is very comfortable to use. Also, I came from a Galaxy S5 and the transfer of data and settings from that phone to the S8 was very quick and easy, and I was impressed at how much this felt like it was my own phone right from the beginning. I would definitely recommend this phone above any others in the market right now.
            "
"697","It may not be the flagship Galaxy S phone anymore but this phone is still a work of art. I've owned mine for 6 months going and it still feels like using a brand new phone. This is partly thanks to the recent Android Oreo update (FINALLY!) though Nougat was still running strong up to before the update with just a few noticeable lags. Throughout the 6 months, I was expecting some major drop-off in performance as a lot of users say Samsung phones do over time. I didn't really experience this. Maybe during the next 6 months? Who knows, but the phone is still amazingly smooth and feels like a high-power piece of tech, despite being surpassed by the Note 8 and S9 series. It's not flagship but it is still top-tier, especially compared to mid-range phones that it is creeping into the price range.BATTERY LIFE: It has been very good, but not amazing, but it survives medium-heavy use with a few ticks of power left at the end of the work day. I normally go home with 20-40% left in the late afternoon, depending on use. I've seen it make it to the end of the night without a top-up charge with medium to light use. It is dependable for a full day of use though not more than that. You will definitely want to charge it at bedtime. I don't ever use Power Saver mode though that is an option if need be and don't really tinker with the battery settings. In conclusion, it is fine with its default settings and you don't have to constantly monitor and change settings to save the phone. The battery only really takes a beating when you use Youtube or play games non-stop. In that case, it will last a few hours.PERFORMANCE: I am an average user. I use average apps like Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Youtube, some games here and there. With Nougat, performance was as expected for a flagship with some stuttering on apps that use the Internet. For example, scrolling down video and news feeds, you get some stutter but nothing you would think the phone froze. One annoying thing is a lag that occurs after you tap an icon to open an app. After you tap an icon, sometimes it would take a full second for the phone to respond, making you think the tap didn't register and as you are about to tap again, the app finally opens and runs smooth. This lag seems to be specific to Samsung phones and seems to be caused when you force-close apps. When you try to open the app again, it takes longer to load back up. I recently found out you aren't supposed to force-close apps so this can be avoided by not force-closing apps. As of the Oreo update, I haven't noticed this lag anymore. The UI has gotten ridiculously smooth since the update. Oreo has made a major difference in refreshing the phone's performance. It almost feels like running stock Android. Almost...DISPLAY: This is the best aspect of this phone. I love staring at the phone screen. Regardless of how much older this phone gets compared to new models, the display will always make the phone look sexy. I pick my wallpapers with care because it lends such a strong attribute to the phone experience with this display. Colorful images with a black background really makes things pop and almost look 3D. It is so heavily immersive you forget you're looking at a screen. HD pictures come to life (not literally of course). The blacks are true blacks which really makes a difference. If there is anything special about the phone, it is the viewing experience which is a major selling point because that is something you experience every time you use the phone. This display turns me into a drooling fanboy. The Infinity Display might turn some people off but I love it. It adds dimension to what is on the screen as you see it falling off the edges rather than being cut off at a bezel, so you get the illusion the image keeps going on forever. It's an unique touch that is exclusive to Samsung though it is best to see it in person to know whether you like it or not. Yes, it does create some added glare on the screen in bright light, but the trade-off is something special.Another thing to point out, the oleo-phobic coating actually works well at repelling fingerprints and feels really nice. It has this soft but smooth gliding feel to it that I haven't experienced with another phone. You fingers feel at home with the touch display. It is not 100% at repelling fingerprints, especially with dirty or greasy fingers, but it gets the job done well. Especially when you compare it to the back glass, which is a ridiculous fingerprint magnet. Use a phone case because the back glass will always look hideous with fingerprints....OVERALL: I might cover more aspects in the future but will leave it there for now. Yes, the phone has some flaws (audio, fragility of being all-glass, the fingerprint sensor is actually quite bad for me, some issues with the camera, lack of software updates though we did finally get Oreo, did I mention the audio?, etc.) but the full package is something great, especially as it moves into mid-range territory. I give it 5 stars NOT because it is a perfect phone but because its features strongly overcome its flaws and leave you with a lasting impression that will keep you looking forward to what Samsung has in store next.

"698","I like the phone in general its an amazingly dense piece of technology.  One feature in particular I was looking for was barometric altimeter and that works well in this phone.  Ride with GPS app can keep accurate topography on my rides.  I have no interest in adopting another voice assistant in my life though, so the bixby stuff is kind of annoying.  I removed the button actuator from my case because it was being pressed when I took the phone from my pocket or just whenever I picked it up to do something else.  The bicycle mount that I use with it also would press that button.  The moto X touch free voice assistant is superior to the button.I'm not sure that the curved screen adds real utility for me.  its cool but I  think I'd prefer the phone to be flat so that a simple glass protector can be used even if that makes the phone a couple of mm wider.The VR viewer device works really nice with this phone and its hi res screen, and the battery life is considerably better than what I was used to with MotoX phones.  Although the curved screen is kinda cool, it makes using a conventional glass protective cover impossible, and I have now shattered my phone after 4 weeks and this is a really expensive screen to fix.  I'm having a little buyers remorse right now.  Turns out that since I am inside the 90 day warranty, samsung will repair it for about $206 wihich is cheaper than buying a kit on Ebay.  Packing it up to send away for that tomorrow.  5 - 7 business day estimated turn around.  The S8 Active is interesting but more than 2X the price.  Given my usage profile, bulkier and more durable would be an acceptable trade off.Update on the repair:  it went smooth, I was billed as expected and got the phone back in a few days.  THEN I drove off from home with the phone on the roof one day and a neighbor returned it to me in tact.  Just a tiny scratch on one corner of the front glass.Full disclosure, I did drop this phone several times before the killer drop which was a stupid situation where I was holding it over my head to get wifi signal over a barrier..  Given that it is front and back glass, its not as fragile as you might think.  Still, its glass, so dropping it on a rock doesn't end well and the direct bonded OLED + touch + 3D glass assembly is not cheap to replace when it happens.

"699","Great phone for the most part. Broke the glass on the back the first day by inadvertently leaning on it while it was in my pocket. Also chipped the back when it dropped 2 feet onto concrete. GET A CASE IF YOU GET THIS PHONE! Also, I wish the fingerprint scanner was on the front instead of the back of the phone so you could unlock it without picking it up.

"701","I bought my S8 phone somewhere else, but the #1 issue with this phone is that it is the most fragile phone in existence. A 1 foot drop can shatter the screen or back glass. They might have fixed the glass in later models but if they didn't it is FIXABLE! Go to ebay and search for galaxy s8  screen replacement. Make sure it is NOT just a glass screen protector. It should come with a set of tools to replace your screen and/ or back. Basically you'll heat the front or back glass and cut away at the adhesive all around the edges and use a pieces of plastic cards to wedge in the sides as you cut all around it to prevent the screen from sticking back to the phone. The kit comes with new glue. Search youtube for how to videos. You will have to unscrew the back and disconnect several connectors. If you do not think you can do it cell phone repair shops can fix this phone for you. The kit is only $25 on ebay,  I don't know what shops charge. You can rest easy now, don't be afraid of literally bricking your phone
            "
"702","A great phone ruined by a dedicated Bixby button that can't be disabled. Bixby is Samsung's attempt to force their Siri-like solution on the world. I hit this button several times a day and everyone around me is forced to listen to this stupid BRRIING sound while I try to kill the app. Other reviewers talk about how easy it is to disable it. You cannot disable it.Again a great phone, but for me no amount of other features can make up for forcing me to deal with Bixby every day.
            "
"703","This is a mostly good phone with lots of positives.  It has a great screen, good speakers for calls and playing music, and the touch interface is very responsive.  I even like the curved, edge-to-edge display. However, Samsung seems to be emerging as the king of bloat and has loaded the phone with Samsung's redundant software that adds zero value other than to make Suman feel they are Apple.  Bixby is just terrible.  In fact, it was still in beta when the phone was released.  It offers nothing over Google Assistant or Cortana and yet Samsung added a dedicated button for it and one keeps getting promoted to set it up which I will not do again.  Samsung Pay is completely unnecessary.  The list goes on but Samsung had a great phone going until the software team got involved and junked it up.
            "
"704","Extremely fragile. After only 6 days of use it fell from my hand to the table (about 5 inches) and the screen cracked, part of the screen went green and stopped working. What about the ""gorilla glass""?? What kind of ""gorilla glass"" can't resist to a 5 inch fall? Samsung has charged me 430 dollars (in Brazil) to Fix the damn thing.DON'T BUY IT!!
            "
"705","Bought this phone from Best Buy June of 2017.  Started to play a solitare game for a few hours a day.  Now I notice that the parts the AMOLED display are burned in.  I thought that burn in went away with Plasma TVs and the old CRT monitors of years past, but Samsung has re-introduced the problem.I like the phone otherwise, but I know this screen burn in issue will really annoy me.  Samsung should be ashamed of themselves ffor using a display type that easily burns in.Before you buy, Google AMOLED Display and Burn in and you will get all the dope on this serious issue.

"706","After I got this phone, I used it less than 10 mins later the screen was froze and didn't response to any actions. I couldn't turn it off. The device keeps on for 4hrs (only thing good is the battery last long time?!) and was super hot the whole time. It finally shouted off after the battery runs out. This is my first purchase Samsung product and VERY DISAPPOINTED!! I don't understand why a new device stop working in the very first day!I contacted to Samsung costumer service and it is horrible horrible horrible. I emailed them several times and NEVER got responds (Their website said they will reply within 24 hrs, never happened!!)

"707","I just replaced the Galaxy S5 with a Galaxy S8.  The screen is beautiful, camera takes amazing photos, better battery performance, and improved signal strength.  However I think the texting feature has taken a step back overall but worst of all, the voice-to-text feature is atrociously poor, constantly misspelling words (like 'clubutt' instead of Columbus), despite repeated attempts of speaking slowly and clearly. Also when texting the auto-suggestion and auto-correction feature routinely provides incorrect options.
            "
"708","I'm rating 5 stars to counteract the carrier shills who tell you not to buy this phone. They are wrong. Anybody who tells you not to buy this because of ""updates"" is a fool. The Unlocked phone is literally the best version, because it works everywhere, and you will never be stuck on a carrier with it. You pick this phone, and you can use whichever carrier has the best service in your area. You won't be under contract, you won't have any obligations, and you get the best price. Buy once, cry once, as they say.Not only that, but you get the phone as Samsung intended, with all features (Samsung Cloud, Caller ID, Device Maintenance) intact and zero carrier meddling.

"709","Awful for photographers. Notice I said photographers and not photography because I'm not referring to the phone camera itself, I'm referring to the phone display. I shoot pictures on both digital and film to share on social media. The camera on the phone is great, not on par with some other flagship offerings, but the ability to shoot raw dng and edit in phone is much appreciated. However, as a photographer who shoot everything from landscape to macros to portraits, I must admit the phone display is absolute garbage. And I knew this coming in as some reveiwers such as MKBHD warned about the warmer and more saturated colors of this phone, particularly the red tones. Here's where the issue lies for me. I shoot a photo of a couple during an engagement session on my digital equipment, throw the picture on my computer with calibrated monitors and color grade to my liking yet maintaining accurate skin tones to the best of my abilities. When I upload the edited images to my phone, the skin color looks like a pumpkin barfed on an magenta crayon. I checked the images on an a few iPhones and LG phones and they look very close to how they did on my calibrated monitor. This poses several problems, 1. people who view my work on Galaxy phones think I suck at photography unless they realize that their display is at fault and 2. When taking raw images on the phone and editing with readily available apps, which is why I picked this phone, the colors I see and believe to be accurate isn't accurate at all! So my workflow would be to take the raw image on the phone, throw on my computer to edit and load back on the phone to share, you see how the workflow is slowed down considering I wanted all that work to be done promptly on the phone? I will admit that for landscape and macro where saturated colors actually enhances the images (depending on personal taste), this is a non issue. I just wish the display wasn't so pumped up like it is. Also I adjusted the display colors to cool it down as much as possible and the skin tones are still awful.The phone itself is top of the line, blazing fast, durable, water proof, detailed display. Nothing more you can ask for in a phone besides more muted reds in the display.
            "
"710","The phone has so many problems like poor network connectivity which causes frequent call drops, call and text lag, wifi and Bluetooth connectivity issues. The seller says the phone is new but after so many issues I am not sure; its more likely that this is a bad refurbished model of the phone. I bought it as a gift and I feel so bad for the person i gifted it to as this turned out to be worst than his 5-yr old phone with a shattered screen! :(

"711","Will not support wifi calling (or other Advanced Calling features) on Verizon.  I was able to install the Verizon sim and get the phone working without problems but features are missing, with WiFi calling being a big one. Verizon says they are aware of this with Samsung S8 unlocked phones and there is nothing they can do as all features are enabled on their end.  Samsung has not responded to my queries so they don't get any points for customer service.Other things to be aware of: It really is slippery so you need a case, but be aware that the case really won't protect the phone screen because it will be designed not to cover the infinity edges.  It really is too big for your pockets.  Cut a piece of foam board the size of the device and carry it around with you for a few days.Other than the missing features, this phone seems to work fine.  I would not buy it again but if you must, get one from your communications carrier, not an unlocked version.

"712","Samsung Galaxy S8 64GB Unlocked Phone - International Version (Midnight Black)I love the Galaxy S8! This is a huge deal for me to write a post of the following caliber because I'm not a tech geek or even someone who is very giving in terms of technology satisfaction, but the S8 warrants it.  For a long time (possibly for some too long for some), I was quite content using my outdated, but excellent S3.  Based on my research, not only was the S8 the most current, but many reviews suggested it was one of the best phones since the S3 and it is. By now you've heard most of the great features, but now you get to hear it from a 50-something female. Let's start with the look. It's just a beautiful phone. It feels good in my fairly large hands, and I feel like I get more because the picture bleeds to the sides. Speaking of getting more, I like the larger size.  As much as I loved my S3, over the years I did begin to long for a larger phone, instead of deferring to my Surface tablet.  When I purchased my S8, I was tempted to get the Plus, but as it turns out, I don't need it.  The best feature for me hands down is the life of the battery and the super fast charger.  Do you remember how quickly the S3 used up the battery life? Yes, I know this is very old news for the thousands who upgrade their phone every year, but for the few thousand in my age group who hold on to technology devices for comfortability, I think you'll find this information helpful.  With the S8, you will be able to leave your portable charger home because you won't need to use every few hours. My S8 is everything!  I've even started going to 1-1 personal Samsung training so that I can optimize use of my phone.  OK young, middle-agers: buy it, then write about it!
            "
"713","I have had this phone since the day it came out. I am a poor college student but my phone that I had previously was not powerful enough for my nursing clinical. I waited to review this device because I wanted to run it through nursing clinical before I have it a good review.1). This phone is a very practical size. It has a large enough screen to be pleasant and easy to use buy without being clumsy in hand. The Super Amoled display is great the best on the market simply put.2). Software and Performance: So we all know Samsung has had its software issues in the past. It is just a really heavy and poorly optimized skin. On top of that, still being on 7.0 Nougat and not 7.1.1 or 7.1.2 is kind of frustrating. They are improved versions of Android with much better battery optimizations. As far as Samsung Experience is concerned, this is a huge improvement from previous iterations of Touchwiz. It is much smoother and more lightweight than before and it helps. With that being said it still has stutter issues. Not lag but stutter. No lag meaning there is no delay response when opening apps and such. But it does fail to open some apps smoothly sometimes. The Snapdragon 835 and 4 GB of ram do enough however to power through everything. I have an app on my phone that we use during clinicals. It has an entire library or medical terminology and practices that we need to be able to call upon at a moment's notice. This phone does not fail me. I also game frequently and this device blows through it.3). Camera: People and reviewers have complained that the camera is just not improved enough. Hmm...thats funny because a lot of those same reviewers have also said it is still one of the top 3 cameras on the market. It is very reliable and takes some incredible pictures. I use it a lot in class for some blackboard notes. Clear as day even in dark conditions. Just a great great camera overall.4)Battery: This has been a very controversial aspect of this phone. Some people have had good battery life, and some have had not so good battery life. I personally get good battery life but not stellar. I keep the phone on 1440p resolution because that is what I paid for, and I get about 4 1/2 hours of battery life. I wake up at 6:30 every morning and my phone lasts me tulle about 11 at night with about 20% to spare. I have had and seen better but the battery has been able to at least keep it's charge very well despite being several months old now.5). Overall: This device is a solid overall package. I think it nails most things but has a few of its querks. A lot of people will be wondering if the Galaxy S8 should be dumped for the Not 8. I would say no. I would personally wait for the S9 or in my case the Note 9. This phone is basically a smaller Note 8 with a single rear camera and no S pen. Unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket the Note has nothing outrageous to offer in comparison.

"714","Okay so to start off Samsung made an incredibly beautiful device however next time they should spend more time working and the hardware functionality.SoftwareMy phone before the Samsung s8 was the nexus 6p.  Needless to say the transition from having no bloat to a bunch of Samsung bloat took awhile to get use to. Touchwiz or tizen is not as bad as it use to be but the part I found most annoying was Samsung's very own so, Bixby.  Samsung even gave Bixby it's own button to access it but I found myself always pressing it on accident and unintentionally. When I would use an ai it would always be Google assistant it seemed more practical than Bixby. Needless to say Bixby is still young and has much to grow but it didn't really leave a lasting impression for me.BatteryThe battery on the s8 was not bad considering it's a quad hd bezleless screen.  When default settings(quad hd resolution mid brightness) were active on the battery I would get around 4 hours of screen on time.  When I changed the setting to full us resolution and low brightness I was able to get through a whole day.  The standby time on this phone is also great. My phone would have around 10% battery life before I went to sleep and when I would wake up it's only be at 8%.CameraUnlike most manufacturers Samsung didn't choose to go dual cameras on this device which wasn't really a bad thing.  This is one of the phones that proves more is not always better(more being more cameras). The back camera does a great job in low light performance and in my opinion still took better photos than the iPhone 7. The selfie camera was adequate it wasn't great in my experience cause Samsung software tends to smooth out the image alot when using the selfie camHardwareThis is the area where I just did not have a good experience with this phone. For starters the fingerprint reader.  I'm not going to complain about the placement but rather how accurate it is.  I had to same the same finger twice and I still can't unlock it on the first try.  I am frequently having to unlock my phone with my password instead cause of how many times it fails to read my fingerprint.  The charging port was another issue I was having. Samsung tends to promote wireless charging for a reason and it's because their charging port is not that great. I use the charger that came in the box and my phone sometimes doesn't even charge or sometimes it doesn't even read that it's a quick charge compatible charger. I tried other chargers but it was even harder to charge.  The other bad part of their hardware is that Bixby button it just isn't that needed and would have been better if the button could be remapped to some other function.DesignOverall the best part of this phone is the design. Samsung s8's design are in a class of their own due to those super thin bezles no one has really been able to match.  The edge display just makes the display experience all the better.
            "
"715","The phone performs great. I mean really. I haven't had any performance issues since buying the phone. The problem is the curved screen. You absolutely cannot find a good glass screen protector for this phone. If you get the soft plastic ones they'll work but hardly prevent cracked screens from drops. The hard glass protectors will always either leave dead spots on the edges or fall off within a week. Often times both. This is a design flaw if you're prone to dropping your phone or work outside of an office. Again, the phone works great

"717","I have galaxy s8 through Verizon. I liked the quality of craftsmanship, performance, and the slick appearance of the phone. However, its screen cracks so easily even with case put on.

"718","I bought this phone unlocked from another source. I was a Nexus phone user and was happily into my Nexus 5x usage for 1.5 years and it went into a bootloop (a known issue). I had to have a phone immediately so bought an S8.Pros;- Beautiful design, screen is awesome- I like how Samsung shows battery percent and data up/download in the status bar- Battery life seems pretty good- MicroSD card capabilityCons:- Screen design (curve) means much easier to break/damage, even with a case- Bixby button is easy to hit, a pain. Samsung has prevented owners from remapping it.- Volume buttons above Bixby button, way too high- FINGERPRINT READER location sucks, and shape sucks too. My Nexus had it right - center back, big pad and easy quick recognition- Samsung Touchwiz launcher is better than old days, but still why mess up vanilla Android? Splitscreen mode not as intuitive as vanilla Android. Home screen has much wasted space as second row of icons goes well above tray, wasting space. I ended up downloading the Google Launcher and that made a huge difference- Camera is surprisingly not as good as Nexus 5x, especially in low light (this is same camera as in Nexus 6p, and current PixelI called Google and even though my 5x is out of warranty, they are shipping me a refurb 5x free! So I am going to pay the restocking charge and return the Galaxy S8, and wait for the Google Pixel 2. Samsung has the name recognition but IMHO this phone is not as good as people think. Google's service was excellent and I'm happy to continue with them where I always have the latest OS and latest security updates as soon as they come out.

"719","So this is the first time I have actually bought a flagship device from Samsung all my previous ones were of the other variety however I can say this is hands down the best device I've had to date.Pros:1. The price, considering the device usually goes for 700-800 USD getting in at 574.99 is a very good deal, this was the factor that made me get it over an iPhone.2. The camera and video quality is AWESOME. I've never had pics looking this great.3. Its super fast like the boot up was effortless and switching between apps is a breeze.4. Since all my previous devices were 1GB RAM and 8 GB memory having one now that is 4GB RAM and 64GB memory its an eye opener plus having expandable storage with an SD card just won my heart.5. Battery life is great. I can go one day without charging with moderate to high usage which is good.6. The speakers are loud AF like I was shocked when listening to Youtube videos.Cons:1. The finger print scanner, this should be a common cry at the moment but its is placed at possibly the most inconvenient place for a finger print scanner.2. The phone is made entirely of glass which for me is a concern cause i'm a klutz so I recommend getting a good case and a Tempered Glass screen protector.FYI: THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED. It can be used with ANY carrier. I am using it in Jamaica right now and it works perfectly fine.I would recommend this phone to anyone because it has good internal and build quality. So this was just my two cents.Samsung Galaxy S8 Unlocked 64GB - US Version (Midnight Black)

"720","I have this phone and it is now less than 4 weeks old.  Overnight as it was charging it came up with a moisture detection message and it won't charge.  It has not been in water although it claims to be ""water resistant"".  The bubble gum answer of use a blow dryer or clean with a Qtip are not working and again, it hasn't been in water.  If the humidity in the air can render a phone less than a month old unusable it is worthless.  Move on to a better option because as you can see on the forum sites, people all over are experiencing the problem.  It is either a hardware or software problem.  The consensus seems to be that it became a problem after the last system update.

"722","I got to put my phones water resistence to the test this summer. While working on my boat my phone slid out of my pocket, I assumed it had gone overboard and into the big blue. It turned out that it slid out while I was selling fish and went to my processing boat in a bag of salmon. My phone then spend the next 2-3 days at the bottom of a fish hold with a few thousand lbs of fish and refrigerated Sea water. When they pumped out one of their deckhands found the phone at the bottom, threw it in a bag of rice and got it back to me. Worked great, some sound issues at first with the ear speaker but it corrected it self. I dont know if it was luck or good engineering, or both. I figured I needed to give them a review after getting back a working phone from all that. Great camra, good data storage the phone is pretty average after that.

"723","It's hard to express how disappointed I am with this phone. The hardware is incredibly fragile and without a very bulky case the screen will inevitably break sooner rather than later. After 5 months the battery is losing its life already. The software is just as bad. The keyboard is jumpy and the autocorrect is always giving me terrible suggestions and sometimes just clears what I've typed entirely for no apparent reason. Bixby is constantly trying to insert itself into my life when I have no interest in it. Apps are constantly crashing and the performance of the phone is generally underwhelming, making it frustrating to use. It's one redeeming quality was that it was waterproof, however I doubt it still is now that the screen is cracked. If I was able to, I would go back to my s5, which was a much higher quality phone in my opinion.

"725","The Samsung Galaxy S8 is extremely helpful with all the features it provides and while also looking really beautiful at the same time. With its Snapdragon 835 Processor it allows the phone to run appropriately fast, and allows the user to be able to run most programs that couldn't be run on previous generations. With that and the four gigabytes of ram the new Samsung Galaxy S8 allows for two windows to be up on the same time; this allows for great multitasking. Even though the internals of the S8 are powerful, the externals are just as good or even better. The Galaxy S8 is by far one of the sleekest phones out there with its infinity screen and beveled edge. The screen it has gives it more real estate which allows it to give a nice wide angle view and look amazing on most applications. While the beveled double edge looks really nice it also is a very useful addition because it gives you the option for an incognito quick menu.this menu has an ever growing amount of possibilities; because it holds more than your top 5 contacts and your top 10 apps. There is a whole selection of extra pages for your bar ranging from far more than a notepad or a full on calculator which can come in handy for real quick math in the samsung app store. The galaxy s8 has one of the best battery lives, for it can last nearly a whole day on a full charge with general use. It also is very durable even though the whole body is made of glass it can sure take a massive beating as well as its water resistant. The S8 has so many features that its hard to mention them all but it is one of the best, if not the best, phone out on the market right now.

"726","This phone is reliable.. but that's all I like about it.  It's smooth, slippery, glass front and back, and is quite possibly the most fragile thing I've ever touched.

In the year that I've had the S8, I have broken the screen three times, and the glass back once.  No case can protect it sufficiently, although to be fair I have not yet tried a foam-padded aluminum briefcase handcuffed to my wrist.If you live in an area that has gravity, I strongly recommend that you select a different device.

"728","I am going to review what I consider the most important features of a phone.Screen (5/5): literally, the most beautiful display I have ever seen. At first, I wasn't sure how the whole curved screen thing was going to play out but after just one day with it I was already questioning if I could ever go back to a normal flat screen. It's awesome.Battery (5/5): I put this thing through its paces. The first few days I used Youtube a ton and played a bunch of games to get a feel for how fast the battery drains. To make it short and to the point, you could obviously drain the whole battery if you turned the brightness to max and just played graphics intensive games for hours, but if we're talking about moderate to heavy use for the average adult then this thing will last all day without even making it to critical levels. I think the lowest I've seven seen the battery after a normal day's use (lots of texting, some phone calls, a few games and some Youtube videos) is like 40%.Storage (5/5): Pretty simple to review this. 64GB is probably enough for most people, and even if it's not you can insert a microSD card.Call clarity (4/5): At first, I didn't realize I had the HD Calling feature on. This made the caller's voice seem super digital and weird, I didn't like it. After I switched it off, it improved the quality but it wasn't the best I've heard. By no means is it bad, just not the best,Feel (4/5): It's a long phone, so if you have small hands you might want to play around with it a little before buying. I have large hands so it isn't as much of a problem for me, but I can see why this might become an issue for others.Speaker quality (5/5): I was pleasantly surprised by the volume and quality of the speakers. Don't get me wrong, they are cell phone speakers, but compared to other phones the S8's sound is above average.Feel (5/5): This thing is sleek. I bought a minimalist case for it because I loved the way it felt in my hand. A few times, I had a moment of panic because I couldn't feel that it was still in my pocket. If you are prone to dropping your phone, I suggest getting a protection plan or a rugged case. I have not dropped mine yet, but I can easily imagine a single drop on a hard surface from waist level breaking the screen if it lands directly on it. The screen is supposedly pretty tough, but I wouldn't test it.If I think of more things to review I will update this, but for now I think that's all I have to say about the Samsung S8. Overall, I've never felt more impressed by a new phone

"737","The phone is fine, but god help you if you have a customer service issue. Absolutely the worst! That's saying something with companies like Comcast in existence, but Samsung takes the cake. They ignore you as long as humanly possible (do not reply at all--let alone in the 24 hours they promise to). If you do manage to get in touch with them, they'll transfer you 4-5 times before telling you the department you need is closed. I pay AT&T $32 a month for this so I'm stuck, but I will NEVER purchase another Samsung product as long as I live and I recommend you don't either--they don't care about theit customers at all.
            "
"738","Some of these good reviews sound like they were written by Samsung employees or sellers. Seriously. This has to be one of the worst Samsung phones I've ever purchased (I've had 4 different versions over the last six years).  The swipe feature used when texting will more often than not pick an odd or nonexistent word instead of the one you want.  The voice to text feature is almost useless.  You seriously can't tell it you want a comma placed?  On my old phone you could.  And even yelling clearly results in almost half the wrong words.  Both of these features have gone backwards at least 2 generations.  As usual battery life sucks.  If you play any games and use your phone what I consider to be  a pretty normal amount throughout the day, the charge won't even last the day.  I'm typically recharging it around 4 pm so I have a full charge before I go out at night. The touch response is terrible and often I have to hit the screen several times to get it to select what I want (this MAY partially be a result of the Gadget Guard Black Ice Screen Guard which is glass and cracks super easily).  And while the infinity screen offers a nice view of pictures and videos, any normal person that holds onto their phone will naturally touch the side and the phone allows this to select random things and jump away from whatever you were doing.  I'm not an apple fan at all (even though my husband and son are trying to convert me), I just wish Samsung would get it together so I'm not swearing at the damn thing everyday.  All this money and I wish I had my S6 back.  Frustrating.
            "
"739","The only thing about this phone I don't like is bixby. The placement of the button is such that every time I picked up the phone, I was hitting the button and activating it. It is annoying as hell! I finally found out how to deactivate the entire app and the button, now I love my phone!!
            "
"740","This is quite possibly one of the worst devices man has ever made. I don't even know where to begin. How about a list of great things about the phone, yes, that is what I will list right here:1.Oh.. well.. yeah. The brand has really declined. STAY AWAY FROM SAMSUNG, YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID
            "
"741","on top of screen burn in issues, my galaxy s8 spontaneously failed after only a year of use. avoid this brand if possible.
            "
"742","Great phone but had to return. I have T-mobile and this unlocked doesn't do video calling and predictive text only branded T-mobile devices do this.
            "
"743","The screen literally cracks so easily.
            "
"744","The phone itself is fine. The form factor is in line with most modern phones. The biggest issue with Samsung's phone is their software. Incredibly slow update times to the latest operating system, resulting in users dealing with a sluggish user experience since they're using an older operating system.You can do better at this price point. Just go buy a One Plus if you want cheaper or Google Pixel for better updates.
            "
"745","Not happy with this phone. The incoming/outgoing calls have issues. Any call after 2 mins the audio is gone. The other person cannot hear me but i can hear them. Please do not buy this version of the phone. Waste of money. Googled and found that there are lot of people going thru this issue without  a fix. Need to call amazon about returning.
            "
"746","Excellent all around. CustomizableUsb c port broke within months. Can only wirelessly charge now.
            "
"747","Great phone but has few cons comes with it. It gets scratch  very easy; from front to back. So get a screen protector  and  a case *asap* if not you will regret it. I sure did.
            "
"748","I do love the design of this phone nice and sleek easy to handle.  Quick and has tons of memory witch is wonderful plus I added an extra storage on top of that.  The camera is the best yet so clear and captures the true light and colors, my family are iPhone lovers however this one had made a few of them switch up.  One of the fastest running phones I've owned yet absolutely in love with this
            "
"749","Everything works out for this phone.But if you are looking for carrier features like HD voice quality, video calling and wifi calling, this is not a device for you. NO UNLOCKED phone will support these features. So its a trade off between the carrier bloat ware and the carrier call features.But all in all this is one rock solid phone.
            "
"750","I liked the last version of this phone better. The S8 is glitchy. Bixby is annoying. The autocorrect seems dumber than The old AI. The curved edges mess with the touch screen. The camera is a little better, but it doesn't make up for the overall poor performance. Not impressed at all.
            "
"751","Earlier this year someone made fun of my old S3. I guess that was sticking around in my head because inexplicably I bought an S8 during the prime day sale. After having the phone for a while I'm ready to say a few things about it.Are any of the flagship phones worth the price?No.No phone is worth this price. For the cost of the S8 I could have replaced my aging laptop.Is this a nice phone? Sure. The screen seems to gather fingerprints more than my old S3, but aside from that I don't have any complaints off the top of my head. The major problem I've already stated. The value of a flag ship phone is far below the retail price. Don't be like me. If you're not actually in high school you're fast running out of excuses for succumbing to peer pressure. None of us need $500-700 phones and there's plenty of other crap to be spending our money on.
            "
"752","Exactly as described.  Using it for quite a while.  No problem at all.  Good phone at a good price.  Very happy
            "
"753","Works perfectly.  Just plop in your carrier SIM card and works great, and you don't get all of those forced app downloads that take up your memory.
            "
"754","sadly, this is one of the worst smartphones i ever owned. I am especially disappointed with the camera which is atrocious. All pictures and video are so noisy and low quality is ridiculous. For a phone this price it's unacceptable. I owned a Galaxy S5 previously, and its camera is so superior to the one on this phone.
            "
"755","Love the camera, love the phone, love the memory card slot, love the speed. If I could put a battery in it worth while I would give it 6 stars.
            "
"756","Had the phone for a year now, no issues. Was able to choose Verizon on Straight Talk.
            "
"757","Overall this is a really good phone. I actually like the fingerprint scanner location. The bixby button is extremely annoying and its the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
            "
"758","Amazing. I never get the wireless charger but the phone and the oculus are great. The best phone is no doubt.
            "
"759","One of the phone was missing the earphones and the charger broken and scratched all over the other perfect condition
            "
"760","I'm not sure if I can get used to this phone coming from a Nexus 6. Since it's a 5.8"" screen and Nexus 6 is 5.9"", I didn't expect there to be a huge difference. But there is. It's so super narrow it's about the same width as a normal ratio 5"" phone. It appears much smaller in person than I expected when I ordered it.That I may be able to adapt to. It's the curved edges that are horrible. Not only do they make it appear even more narrow, but things on the edge are slightly distorted and the color is off unless you look at it dead on, and even then I can see a bit of distortion and discoloration on the curved edges. At an angle it's unbearable the way the edges are darker than the rest of the screen. It's especially noticeable when the screen is a solid light color, with the edges having a blue tint.This alone is a deal breaker for me. It's hard to look at. If it was a flat, even surface it would be so much better. I don't predict this gimmick catching on. At least I hope it doesn't.
            "
"761","Have this for 3 months. So far so good, no problems at all.Phone came brand new in a box. Love the looks of the phone and performance.Battery keeps cellphone alive one day.

"762","I'm going to get rid of my S8 Plus because of Bixby.  I'm tired of it taking over my phone.
            "
"763","I had this phone for about a year and one month and was the best phone I ever had. The camera is point and shoot and the screen is amazing. But recently the phone kept restarting and shutting down. I sent it in to Samsung and since it is 1 month out of warranty I will have to pay a 70 dollar fee. Not a big deal untill they received my device and they now say it is going to be 630 dollars to repair. This is unacceptable and I will never buy another Samsung again!
            "
"764","Had it in my pants pocket and screen scratched after two days.  Never put it into anywhere else that would be endanger it.  There was nothing in the pocket too!!! My friend dropped it from the couch to carpet and it shattered as well. Too bad because the software and camera are great. Cannot recommend this phone.
            "
"765","If you like to be surprised several times every day by your phone doing something different, this is the phone for you!!!I do like the hardware.TERRIBLE software! There are layers and layers and needless, annoying complexity that I don't want or need. The worst thing about this phone is it is UNPREDICTABLE. Today I COULD NOT answer an incoming call even though the phone was in my hand! I had been browsing the Internet on Chrome and could HEAR the ring  but NO INTERFACE to answer. A day or two ago I got no interface to shut off the LOOKOUT scream feature. Sometimes I get the proper interface, other times not! Full of surprises!Bixby is useless and annoying as well, and so is the ""battery charging"" screen. Getting into the phone is a hassle most of the time. Sometimes you have to do your pattern, then swipe past a screen or two then do you pattern AGAIN. Why? Who knows. Next time it might be different!Samsung should stick to HARDWARE and let GOOGLE do the software. Give people ANDROID STOCK phones and stop trying to compete with your own partner. Please! PLEASE!!! If Samsung didn't waste money paying designers and developers to add GARBAGE that degrades they phone, it would probably be better AND cheaper.I think letting you answer calls is JOB ONE for a PHONE.Mine fails that most basic task...sometimes...because it is clogged with a bunch of kludgy garbage software. Very disappointed.
            "
"766","The screen cracks easily  and you will be out $700+ dollars (not covered in manufacturer's warranty).  You don't need to drop the phone to crack the screen.This is a warning, Google ""Samsung Galaxy S8"" and screen and see what you come up with.If Samsung doesn't issue a recall, there may soon be a class action lawsuit.

"777","cannot stand this phone.  round edges are sleek but not user friendly;  hard to tap on apps when the tap is on the curve of the phone.  Connectivity seems to be not as good as what i had with S6 which seems to be a Verizon problem in general these days.  Also, the slide answer button on the phone for incoming calls sometimes fails to slide and connect????  Look elsewhere, this is not your latest greatest of smart phones.

"782","I am disappointed with this purchase.  AT&T is my service provider and I have limited cell phone service at home.  Someone suggested turning on WiFi calling to improve cell service.  I did not find the WiFi calling option on this unlocked cell phone.

Very disappointed that unlock phone does not have same features AT&T/carrier purchased phone.

"793","Great looking phone but not a good daily driver.  Very slippery and edge to edge screen too prone to accident touching.  I keep tapping on the phone icon by accident while holding the phone.  Bezels being too thin here really is problematic.  Apple has much better accident touch detection.A case can help with the issue but can't fix the really weak battery life.  Typical daily use, I am down to 54% by noon time.  Requires charging, luckily there is fast charging.  They should include a bigger battery not smaller.The new touch screen home button is very confusing and awkward to use.  I have used Pixel, Nexus 6P, this new home button mimicks a physical one but performs very slowly in responsiveness.  You really have ""find"" the home button.  It doesn't just press anywhere on the bottom to activate it.The screen also seems to lag behind S7 Edge in responsiveness.This is not a good phone for Pokemon Go at all.  The battery life sucks and the phone isn't much faster than S7 Edge.Plus side camera and screen quality is great but not a huge leap over the S7 Edge.

"796","Do not purchase this phone. This phone calls people in my contact list all day. This phone opens applications all day. Can't  turn off Bixby which is calling and opening apps indiscriminately and Samsung says that there is no way to disable or turn off the very sensitive Bixby button.  There is no Bixby application button  to open  Bixby if you could turn off very sensitive Bixby button.  Butt dialing or pocket dialing is the issue, sensitive home button that opens the phone when it's locked, sensitive Bixby button that opens the phone when locked, camera on the lock screen opens the camera and starts taking pictures. When holding the phone applications near the edge of the screen and your hand open.

That¡¯s a fact, look it up. 3 of 4 people that bought a crappy Samsung product and try to get Samsung to stand behind their product, give up because the process is more of a headache than it¡¯s worth.Buy your goods from companies that stand behind their products and actually WANT to make quality products and stay true to their word.

"818","BEWARE!99% of the negative reviews are SELLER REVIEWS! People bought used products or from a private seller and got something not covered by amazon. BUY NEW, FROM AMAZON. If you don't know how to shop, I suggest you double check where the item is coming from in your cart and before you check out. PAY ATTENTION!After owning the phone long enough to be familiar with it, I thought I would leave a decent review outlining some of the pro's and con's, as well as some neutral's. My review is as follows: (see end comments about unlocked and verizon use - this phone is 100% unlocked!)Pro's:1. Very sleek design. Very nice screen and overall a great phone.2. The camera/video recorder is AMAZING. Simple as that. I took amazing outdoor and indoor (even in low light/no light) pictures. I am genuinely impressed and was not expecting it to be so good. (See last pic. Photo on phone was taken by s8)3. The pixel ratio/screen size. I got the s8 because I did not want a huge computer in my pocket, and it has plenty of room in it.4. Very fast. The processor even with battery settings set to a mid level (which can be changed to your personal preference) is still fast enough to do anything you can throw at it.5. RAM and Storage ration. Perfect. Plenty of ram to handle multi-tasking and plenty of storage to handle those 4k videos/pictures PLUS room to expand with SD storage, which is also getting much better and bigger. But 64GB entry level... eat your heart out apple.6. Great speaker! I mean wow... this thing get's loud. I was also not expecting such great sound. You will have no trouble hearing anything even in a loud environment. Seriously amazed here.7. Power saving/Battery life. Simply put, the AMOLED allows for some amazing battery life and the 3000mah batter holds up well. Very well. Much better than the iPhone.8. Fast charging. The lowest I have had the battery is about 60% and it charged in under an hour.9. AMOLED screen. As stated in #7, it helps with battery life but other than that, it has plenty of brightness and picture clarity. I also carified in #3 that the screen size and pixel ratio were simply stunning. You will notice this if you game alot or during those 4k picture zooms and probably much more on the s8+.10. Accessories and headphone jack. It has a headphone jack! lol. The accessories that came with the phone are great. A fast charging cable, a type-c to mini usb extension, and a usb to type-c extension as well. The headphones are simply amazing too. By far some of the best I have owned, as far as ear buds go, and you don't have to pay for good quality here. The material of them is great and they come with extra different size earbuds.11. Water resistance. While I have not tested it, and probably never will, it's a great feature. I still don't recommend dunking your phone.12. Pocket settings. There is an option to keep the screen off while in your pocket, or something like a purse. Simple as that. If you butt dial, you probably are not navigating the settings well enough. Keep in mind, android has A LOT of settings, and it would be wise to go through them all including the basic options that samsung offers.13. Widget size. You can actually adjust the size of every single widget, and fit more apps on the pages as well as the default home row. You can also change the lock screen apps, if you want any at all. I personally have a camera and the phone app on the lock screen, and keep all my apps on a single page, in folders, the weather, a google search bar with the mic button, and lastly a control panel for quick access to bluetooth and auto-sync buttons etc etc.. All on one page, with plenty of empty space. Half the screen is even still empty. Thank you so much for resizeable widgets.Neutral:1. Bixby button. The button is below the volume buttons, so nothing you can do there. However, you can disable bixby. Most reviews on here are failing to realize this and also failing to outline how. See the end of my review for simple instructions.2. Phone Length. I'll admit, it's pretty long. Maybe I am just to used to an older, smaller phone, but one handed operations is going to take some getting used to. Be mindful of the edges of the screen too. Too much palm and you will be scrolling. I do not see this as a negative still, just takes some getting used to and as outlined in the pro's section, the overall screen size is perfect.3. Edge lighting. A bit torn on this one. It seems cool, but is pretty much useless. It's basically a notification before the notification. So you would have to tap twice and then unlock as well. IMHO, it does look really cool, but SAMSUNG needs to give us more control over it.4. Always on display. This can also be turned off. I find it 100% useless, but not a negative by any means. I feel it can definitely cater to some users who enjoy always being able to look at their phone. I personally disabled it and honestly looked no further into it.5. Color settings. I have always disliked samsung's default colors. Especially on TV's. However, there is an option to change them to your liking. I chose the basic setting, but there is even an option to change balance which let's you arrange a set of liked color boxes, whites, and blacks to your liking and all kinds of other options for personal preference. It really is a great setting, however, it is a neutral and not a pro simply because they enable a very rich color by default. So I recommend changing this to suite your own eyeballs.6. The lock screen clock/theme settings. In order to change the lock screen clock, you have to register with samsung themes and install a theme, which can be somewhat custom. I did this, and the deactivated my account. The setting were retained and all is well. Still a neutral because I feel samsung should incorporate a way to change the lock screen clock by default to a couple preset clocks. The standard one IMHO, is ugly and not aesthetically pleasing to read.Con's:1. Typical android settings. Everything is always on. This is not a samsung issue, but android. I recommend going through every single option, and every single app to change every single setting. Sometimes, this can take the first week of owning an android phone to get right. This also almost always has a HUGE impact on battery life. There are settings in sub-menu's of settings. So please, NAVIGATE YOUR ANDROID SETTINGS! Your poor battery life is not due to this phone at all. It is due to negligence and laziness.2. ""Ok Google"". This seems to always be on, even when turned off in googles settings. I have a search bar and I have turned off all settings both in the phone and google, but for some reason if you say those two naughty words, it still comes up. However, if you do not set it up, it will only be asking you to set it up. Same thing as bixby almost, but this is a negative because I do not want my mic on. At all. I think samsung needs to address this before anything else, even the bixby issues some people are not liking or failing to change.3. All glass. The phone is not strong by any means. It does not feel like a cheap POS, but it is all glass. This belongs in the negative because most of us are drop prone, and even if you are not, it is very easy to make a mistake. Overall, it looks amazing, but there is no need for a glass backing too. I highly recommend you get a case, and if you are in fact drop prone, get a big durable case like an otterbox with a screen protector. The risk will always be there with all smart phones, but the s8 being all glass just seems pointless. That said, I have NEVER dropped a phone to a point where it broke (fingers crossed, knock on wood).4. The finger print scanner. What a stupid placement for a finger print scanner. Right next to the camera lense? come on... I personally do not use it at all, but if I did and wanted to take a picture, you would be cleaning your lense as soon as you unlocked it. Nobody wants to take an unclear photo because they used the finger print security feature. I like the Google Plus one, but feel that if any, Apple has the best one being in the home button.On a side note: THIS PHONE IS UNLOCKED. It can be used with ANY carrier. If you do not pay attention to who or where you buy it from, at least leave a sellers review instead of a product review. 99% of the negative reviews are this. Please pay attention and buy a new phone from Amazon only. I do not ever recommend getting a refurb on this kind of product, or buying from a private seller regardless of their rating. You just never know.As for Bixby, all you have to do is not set it up and hold the home screen like you are adding a widget, scroll to the left and hit the button to turn it off. This will not remove it, but will stop it from doind whatever crazy stuff these other reviews are talking about. I have had NO ISSUES with bixby, because I turned it off. Also, make sure you go through your settings, including the subsettings imbedded into android like background data usage etc etc and turn it all off. People having battery issues, I guarantee it is not the s8's fault. It is android and you would not get any better life with iOS for failing to go through your settings. GO THROUGH YOUR SETTINGS! every. single. one. Over and over for a week until you find every nook and cranny. There is a lot!Overall, this phone is amazing. The list of pro's, con's, and neutral's are simply my take and my opinion. I do recommend the phone. At least if you are in a position to think about it and can try it, go to a local store and pick one up on the display to play with it, but it's just not the same as owning it. I was torn between a google pixel xl and this one, but when this dropped in price it made my decision that much easier. I did like the idea of a bigger phone, however, I just kept thinking how big it would be in my pocket. So I went with the standard s8 and I am very happy I did. I do a lot of fishing, hiking, and outdoor stuff and 90% of the time, I TRY to keep my phone around me in my pocket in case of an emergency. Usually off, because where I go there is no signal anyways.Any review stating a mostly negative opinion, in my opinion, is probably a bit trollish or did not do any research and made an impulse buy. I think you can get used to this phone and if you are complaining about the things I have outlined here, the only one to blame is you. So give it a try, navigate ALL the settings, get used to android, and don't drop this phone lol! Thank you for reading.

"819","I haven't owned a Galaxy phone since the Galaxy Nexus.I've always felt that Samsung's Touch Wiz UI was too gimmicky and looked cartoon-ish.This is my 5th phone in the last 6 months. I was coming from a Nexus 6P, One Plus 3T, Axon 7 and LG V20.I really liked the LG V20 for it's cameras and the Axon 7 for it's front facing speakers. The 6P and One Plus 3Twere so smooth. But I decided to trade it all in for the S8.I was initially going to get a Google Pixel, but prices were still high and besides the camera, not much appealed to me.The S8 is a damn sexy phone with over 80% of the front being the screen. I like the size. Fits perfectly in my hands.I don't think I will go back to a 6"" phablet phone. The screen is vibrant. The clear flip cover case works well with it too.Touch Wiz has been toned down from what I remember, but there is still a lot of bloatware, which I quickly disabled.I guess I like all the screen shot options this phone has to offer. You take screen shot many ways, annotate, make gifs, etc.Charging is pretty fast and the battery lasts me all day. The included headphones are really good. Can't go wrong with AKG. They look cheap, but they sound superb. I'm using Face Unlock, it's really fast. I have my finger print set up too, but face unlock is faster and more convenient. I guess someone can always hold up a picture right? (Haven't tried it yet) The finger print sensor takes a little bit to get used to. My finger naturally goes to the where the camera is located and you need to fully press on the sensor to get it to unlock.They should move the camera to the corner like some phones.USB-C is awesome.Bluethooth 5 is Awesome. You can now stream to 2 separate bluetooth speakers at the same time (one will have a slight delay though).I have a few gripes.Even though it has a F1.7 aperture the camera is not wide angle. It does take really good pictures and videos.My other gripe is the single speaker. C'mon... it's 2017.... all Flagship phones should have stereo speakers.Get rid of Bixby. Let us just use Google Assist.By default the phone display is set to 2220X1080, which is fine for me. You can always set it to WQHD (2960X1440). I'm not sure how much more battery the phone will be using if you did. I still like that Samsung lets you put a SD card it it and it comes with a OTG adapter so you can plug in other USB sticks too. The Edge panel is just ok. Still getting used to it. I can live without it.This phone has tons of other features too, but I'm not going to list them all. Overall, it's the best smart phone I've ever owned. Hopefully it holds up well over the next 2 years.
            "
"820","I upgraded to this S8 from my S6 Edge since I was getting fed up with the capped storage capacity at 64GB otherwise I probably would have waited another year or 2. (And sun spots which burned permanent purple dots on my front facing cam. . .)This phone has some upgrades which I personally enjoy:-Battery Capacity. Holy cow. This thing actually lasts me over 10 hours of almost constant Netflix streaming with brightness at 75% with bluetooth wireless earbuds and that only bring its to about 30-35% battery. It then still lasts the rest of the day at 25% brightness taking it down to just about 15% battery. (I normally start charging it up once it hits 20% though)-Camera Function: Incredibly fast focus and quality. (Only minor con is that it's not amazing in low light, using ProMode helps a bit though)-Smooth touchscreen with a lot of customization features within the phone itself.-Being an unlocked phone, minimal bloatware comes on the phone. (Sadly there are some things...)-You can easily turn Bixby off if you don't like it. (The camera item search/translator is pretty fun though!)-Always on display is actually really helpful for me since I don't have to reach over to see the time if I randomly wake up in the middle of the night. I keep it simple without a background and just colorized text, so it doesn't seem to consume much battery even if it's. . . always on. (You can also set it up to show during certain hours in a day.)-It still allows your to insert microphone jacks.-USB-C, I personally like it since I dont have to worry about turning it around to fit anymore. (Box also comes with some adapters.)-And obviously the MiscroSD storage. Stuck a 128GB card in there upon arrival.Some downsides on the phone:-Fully made of glass. It's not cheap feeling in the slightest, but it makes you a bit more paranoid if it does fall. (Highly recommend a good case for this phone)-Wish this came with a non-Edge version. Honestly don't enjoy it that much and causes issues with a lot of screen protectors, but I couldn't pass up the sale on the phone.-Comes pre-installed with Facebook. I don't use facebook so it's just an annoying app chilling on my phone which I'd rather have completely uninstalled instead of just disabled.-Bixby button. . . well that thing is just kinda there. I don't hit it often but when I do it's just mildly inconvenient. Thankfully my case has little ridges on the button which make it easier to locate the volume when needed. The button can become an issue on some phone stands though.This phone was able to hit all the things that I want in a phone: Good camera, long battery life, adjustable storage, crisp display, and functional.All in all, I very much enjoy this phone with only minor gripes which aren't enough to make me dislike the phone at all.(Yes, this phone works with most if not all carriers. That includes Verizon. You can even see this written on Samsung's fine print for the phone. You may need to have the SIM card activated in another phone first then switch it into your S8.)
            "
"821","The Galaxy S8 is a solid, quality phone based on my use of it over the past month+.  It was a welcome upgrade to my S5, which had become terribly buggy and crash-prone with the latest software updates.  I hesitated to give Samsung another try after so many later problems with the S5.In the end it was worth the upgrade.  As expected, the S8 was fast and slick, although some of the standard apps suffer from usability changes for the worse, compared to the S5.  I have come to expect this with any major software/hardware upgrade so it's hardly worth mentioning.Of note however, is the hoops I had to jump through to get this phone working with Verizon.  This review has less to do with any issues with the phone itself (there have been almost none) and more to do with the general incompetence of the specific staff at my local Verizon store.This unlocked 64GB phone is perfectly compatible with the Verizon network and now is working great; however, the Verizon store employees were unable to get my phone working out of the box because it was not a ""Verizon Branded"" S8.  Do yourself a favor; call Verizon tech support to get it figured out.  After almost a full day of fruitlessly working with the store employees and managers and being sent on one wild goose chase after another, a 15 minute call to Verizon tech support resolved everything.Note that this phone takes a mini SIM card and can't simply be swapped from the S5; this is why I had to endure a trip to the local Verizon store at all.Also note; if activating this unlocked phone on Verizon, they will not allow you to download or install their standard Verizon voicemail app.  You will be required to download another voicemail app/service from the Google app store.  Not a big deal; Youmail fits the bill just fine for me.Other than those few minor bumps, it was much worth getting the unlocked S8 on Amazon for hundreds less, without being stuffed to the gills with bloatware, compared to the Verizon branded S8.
            "
"822","This phone should be a no-brainer. Easily the most stunning display ever on a phone, great specs, Samsung Pay, expandable storage, and waterproofing SHOULD make this the best phone on the market. Enter Samsung's software. While Touchwiz isn't nearly the raging dumpster fire it was back in the S4 and S5 days, there's still a lot of extras that most will consider junk. Chief among these is Bixby. Have you ever wondered what Siri would be like if it were dumber and had a dedicated hardware button? That's Bixby. Not content to let Google do the heavy lifting, Samsung's MO continues to be creating inferior versions of services already offered by Big G. Want to remap that button to something actually useful? Too bad. Samsung keeps patching the phone in order to force their bloatware down your throat. As it is, that's a dead button that you'll press once out of curiosity, and a few dozen times while trying to turn down the volume. One other annoyance of note is the horrible placement of the fingerprint scanner. There's just no excuse for this one.Overall, it's a great phone that's held back by Samsung's usual goofball decisions.
            "
"823","Really bad service from Samsung. The phone came with a defect in the front camera. I called them and they told me it will be fixed when the phone updates to the new version. I was back and forward with Samsung since I notice the issue. I noted first when I made my first skype meeting call. Then when my colleges told me about the issue, I started taking selfies, I notice that all the selfies have the same black spot in the same place. Unfortunately, I figured out the issue 36 days after I bout this phone from Amazon. So, I  could not return the phone due to the 30 days return policy.I contacted Samsung, they asked me to update and reset the phone and so a bunch of staff to the camera app. After the 2nd call, They sent me to a Repair Center close to my home. The repair center wanted to charge me $109 dollars. I called Samsung again. This time Samsung told me that because I was under warranty they can fix it for me. They cannot replace phones but just fix them. Samsung told me that they will take 11 days to fix it. I expressed my concern that I bought an expensive phone because the service as my work and my business depend on a reliable phone. I told them that I cannot afford 11 days without communication. So, they told me ""Well you won't be without communication you can buy a ship phone and exchange the sim card until your phone cames back"".So, does not Samsung understand that an unlock cheap phone cost at minimum 120 and it won't be able to multitask as fast I need to do my job and maintain my business?I do not recommend to buy this phone or any Samsung phone if service and reliability is the most important subject for your purchase.
            "
"824","This is one of the coolest cells ever. I had no problem activating.  I read many reviews before buying it and was all prepared to go through the drama everyone said with activating.  First I connected to my WiFi and transferred everything. Which was simple. The phone walked me through connecting the sub and my old droid. The transfer took 1hr 17m. Then I removed my sim card insert it. The phone detected it was a Verizon SIM and completed update. I was able to make a call immediately. The phone walks you through every feature and it is so simple. Don't believe all the negative reviews. This phone is worth it.
            "
"825","I've had it for a few months now and while I've gotten used to it, I can honestly say I don't like this phone.I'm always triggering Bixby, which is annoying in itself, but add to it that it's a fairly useless feature and it becomes a lot worse.I'm not overly impressed by the camera, I came from a Note 4 so I expected to be blown away.Accessing camera settings is a pain and it seems there are fewer manual options than with the Note 4 in terms of camera functionality - or maybe I just haven't figured it out yet, but even if that's the case, it's annoying.After the transfer, about a week in, a bunch of my pictures and contacts were gone and it seems the Cloud had specifically ""chosen"" not to back those up as well.Occasionally the Maps vocal function doesn't work, I have yet to figure out why.The Fingerprint function should be located better.Now learning that Droids were targeted with the most privacy issues... I don't know, I've been a pretty advid Droid fan, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this one and I might turn away from the brand entirety.
            "
"826","This phone is advertised as having a ""Samsung US Limited Warranty"" and as ""new.."" Oh really?I bought two of these phones on Jan. 31. Recently one of the phones developed occasional blackouts and poor energy consumption. I brought it to a Samsung repair facility, which told me that the warranty expired in July 2018! I was shocked. I rushed home and called Samsung, which confirmed that information. I then registered the phones on the Samsung website, which again confirmed that these two ""new unlocked"" phones were in fact Verizon phones, and that the warranty had expired on July 8, 2018 for both phones.I then brought the phone with the bad battery to the Samsung-owned service facility on Greenwich Street in NYC, in the hope that maybe there was a mistake, but again it was confirmed that the phone was used and with an expired warranty.The phones were returned for a full refund. But getting that refund required repeated phone calls and an email exchange with the seller, during which he initially indicated that a refund was not possible because the 30 day period had lapsed. The whole experience was a stressful waste of time that flushed two days of my life down the toilet.The moral of the story is that you should always check the IMEI numbers before buying a cell phone online, including Amazon. Do so IMMEDIATELY.  Better idea: DO NOT BUY CELL PHONES ONLINE I got the same damn phoneas, brand new, from my celll phone carrier for fifty bucks more each.

"827","After using an old phone with such a large bezel, the switch to the Galaxy S8 was spectacular. I could not stop staring at the screen when I first saw it. There is just so much of it! After using this phone for a couple months, I have created a list of what i love the most and dislike the most of this product.Pros:-Screen has amazing brightness, resolution and size.-Cameras are spectacular. Images are sharp and crisp.-Opposed to contrary belief, the fingerprint scanner on the back is easy to reach and is very responsive-Battery life is very good, also charges very quickly with the included Fast Charger-Has Video Enhancement and Game Enhancement modes for when you need extra brightness, performance and screen resolution.Cons:-Feels very delicate (easily solved with a case)-Glass on the back so it is a fingerprint magnet (easily solved with a case)-Bixby Button can be confused as Volume Down button, also Bixby software is not the best at the moment but it is a new product and has lots of potential.Overall great phone and great experience so far. Would Recommend!
            "
"828","After 10 years with Apple, bye bye Apple I'm done. After holding this phone you realize Apple had stopped innovating. This is by far the most beautiful, sleek fluid thin light weight designed phone ever to be offered. The infinity screen is stunning to the human eyes, the speed of the processor is just amazing.
            "
"829","I have had my Galaxy S8 for a little bit now and it has been great so far! I love how fast it is. I love the little things about it. The screen is absolutely phenomenal with the curve and screen to body ratio. The fingerprint scanner is great and I know majority don't like the position but for me it works amazing. It fits well in the hand and the cases feel just as nice. Luckily I have not dropped it yet so I hope if I ever do that it withstands the drop that would most likely be out of my pocket or about chest height. Switching from a Galaxy S5 to this S8 was a big change for me and I am glad I made it. Anyone who is thinking about getting this phone, I would say do it. It has everything you could want and more. I was torn between this and the Pixel 2 and they both have almost the same internal hardware but this has a 3.5mm headphone jack. You can't beat that because most companies are now doing away with it. I love not being able to plug in a dongle if I want to quickly listen to music or watch a short video. Honestly, I know I am bias towards Samsung products but everything I have had and also my friends/family have are amazing. They made great phones and appliances. Everything they make is top of the line and that's just the truth.

"830","OMG! I can't tell you how happy I am with the my broken phone!Apparently, I can no longer post an honest review, so, let me state here how completely satisfied I am with my Samsung S8 that died after 5 weeks of use!  I know, you too must be dying to spend $500 on a useless phone.  Well, look no further! Not only did my phone die after 5 weeks ... communication with Amazon and the seller was fruitless!SO YES ... if you are looking to throw $500 out the window, than this is the phone for you
            "
"831","Amazon was having a $200 off deal on this when I purchased, which... is really good for a new phone, actually. I moved to this from the S5, and it's a big change. Overall this is very slick, fast, and high-performing. I like it much better than the S5--everything is faster and more responsive. The edgeless screen made me nervous at first, but the case I purchased seems to protect it okay. I've dropped it a couple times already from a distance of about 2-3 feet, face down and in its case, and it's been fine. If it breaks within a year, I'll update my review accordingly.My favorite feature is that its narrower--I like big phones, but I don't have big hands, so they can be exhausting to hold after a while. This one is just the right size to easily hold in one hand, while still having excellent screen real estate. It's not very heavy, which makes it easy to continuously read and interact on it one-handed, too, even with a heavier case.My least favorite feature is Bixby--while it has its uses, it really isn't that great at interacting with apps or hearing commands properly. It won't open non-Google apps on command, which is a huge pain, and half the time seems to mishear me even when I speak directly into the microphone and enunciate very clearly. Right now I solely use it to turn off the always on display at night, which seems like a waste for what could otherwise be a very powerful tool. It's actually kind of bizarre that it's as bad as it is, considering how many voice-controlled devices are on the market right now.
            "
"832","This is quite a phone.It's extremely fast compared to our older Samsung S4.It's unlocked, so even when the kind folks at Verizon looked at me as if I was ignorant and gullible as they wondered out loud if the phone would work on the Verizon network, I knew it would (having read the reviews at Amazon) and I just told them to produce the free small sims card.  (Sorry about the lost commission guys, not.)If one already has a Samsung, it works in a similar fashion and a couple of days messing around with it is enough to gain a reasonably good working knowledge of the phone.  The Samsung site is quite informative and I've referred to it several times already.One strange thing is what feels like dueling systems on the phone.  You have the Google Android apps and simillar Samsung apps.  Many do the same things so choosing one or the other is really personal preference.I can't get over how fast this phone surfs the internet (I use Firefox) and how nicely photos are auto-arranged by date.
            "
"833","PROS:Great phone in almost all regards.  My last one was a Samsung S5.  This is noticeably faster to respond, and battery life is improved. It uses a USB-C connector, which I guess is the new standard, so I'm replacing all my cables.  (Samsung's package includes a short USB-C cable and charger, plus a Micro-USB to USB-C adapter.)Nice display.  This is the standard S8, not the S8 Plus, but this one is plenty big. WARNING:  It's all glass, so I strongly recommend buying a protective case.  I did.Nice camera.CONS:Battery cannot be opened nor removed.Phone does not have ""Wi-Fi Calling"" (voice over Wifi) feature.  Most phones have had that for years, including my old Samsung S5.  It may be up to the carrier to turn on that feature, and this phone came ""unlocked"" with no carrier.  I've contacted a couple people at AT&T but they say ""it's just not on this phone,"" and of course they cannot fix the missing feature.
            "
"834","This is a good phone with some major issues.First good:--Very nice display and good sound--Good camera, especially in low light.--Looks really good.Now to the bad:--Some of the applications that used to run before without problems, now take huge resources and stop working, e.g. requires rebooting the phone every time I want to use Amazon Prime Video.--Display while good is fingerprint and dust magnet and all these things reflect in sunlight making viewing experience less than optimal, to put it mildly.--It may be T-Mobile specific but data connection settings do not include both 4th and 6th standards for the network, so I had to create my own setting for it-- The biggest thing the phone front camera and back flash (as well as all camera software) stopped working after only two months. After analyzing the issue (Samsung has internal hardware checking menu), I found out that it was hardware issue. It was confirmed and fixed by Samsung center in Manhattan (Guys at ""Samsung 837"" are great. If anyone lives in NYC Metro area, you should visit Samsung 837: great service, great experience and they do not try to sell, they just show the products and explain).
            "
"835","First let me get this out of the way: This phone for the most part is awesome. The specs are beastly, the camera is among the best in class, the 1440p bezel-less curved display looks amazing, and the features this phone has is vast and actually useful in everyday usage. But while this phone is objectively one of the best out right now, it is also one of the most fragile. The backglass on mine broke within a week of usage and I actually had to replace the backglass in order to fix this. To put it in context, the only other phone glass that I have ever broke is the iPod Touch 4th gen, and I had that for nearly 2 years of usage before that happened. This is not a durable phone in the slightest, and I would highly recommend getting a case or skin for it if you plan to get this phone. Outside of that, this is a great phone and I'd recommend it assuming you are cautious enough to avoid issues
            "
"836","I have had my S8 purchased directly here through Amazon for exactly one year last week. It has been great except for one big problem. About two months ago I saw a moisture warning stating ""Check USB/Charger Port: Moisture has been detected in your charger/USB port. Make sure it's dry before charging your phone. It may take some time to dry completely"". Initially the warning went away, but then it came back about a week later and has stayed lingering on my swipe screen and notifications area ever since. No amount of drying or cleaning the USB port fixes it. It wont let me charge the phone with the USB cable. There is a work-around, I can restart the phone and plug it in just as the restart screen appears, but this is a huge PITA, especially if I am using the phone for GPS and driving. So while I love all other aspects of the phone, this defective USB moisture sensor is ruining an otherwise excellent product. I have even tried putting it in my laboratory desiccator in case there was any trapped moisture, but not effect.

"837","I already have an S8 for personal phone so purchased a second one for my Work phone.  This one came with T-Mobile branded but just like my other one it changed to Verizon as soon as I put in the SIM.  I have had my personal phone almost 2 years and by far the best device I have every used.  Battery life on it is amazing and of course I tweaked and removed many apps I will never use to help.This phone is just as awesome except the battery life.  After all day light use I am down to 25% with Mid-Level power savings implemented where as my other main phone is still 65% - 70% if no power savings profile. If I used it heavily I need to recharge at least once.  I have tweaked and changed everything but after doing my experiments there is definitely something different.  Either I just have and exceptional battery in my 2 year old phone or the new one has some short comings.I am going to continue with the phone but I am guessing I will need to get the battery replaced sooner than I was expecting.  Love everything else but that is very disappointing.

The phone was easily added to my existing Verizon account saving $300 on the purchase price without paying a  ""$50 activation fee"". I actually took the phone to a Verizon store and a very nice Verizon employee did all the work, including adding a screen saver and Otter box. Hated my 7, which failed from day one. I love the 8 and loved losing all the Verizon apps I never asked for or needed.

"839","Bought ""Refurbished"" item from seller EDGE CELLULAR.  Received model SM-G950U1 factory unlocked phone.  Came in generic box with just phone (in bubble wrap), white samsung charger and cord as the description said it would.  Looked new, not used and works great so far.Had old Samsung Galaxy Core Prime phone bought through Verizon years ago that I uesd before this S8.  That one is Verizon locked and takes a micro SIM card.  Went to Verizon store, said I bought the phone online and needed a nano SIM card since old one wouldn't fit, he went in back and got a SIM card and put it in phone and got it working in about 5 min, no questions asked.  Works perfectly.  Couldn't be happier and at a great price.Only drawback:  registered the phone on samsung website, says warranty expired little less than a month ago.

"840","Today my Samsung S8 died. Fine one minute, completely dead the next. I switched out from iPhone and when it worked, I loved it. Tried all the available salvage options, but no use,  it's completely unresponsive no matter what. 13 months of use - seems like a heavy price tag. Hence the 1 star rating. Samsung , please get your act together.
            "
"841","I was looking for a new Android phone and it came down to this or the Pixel 2. The Pixel 2 doesn't have a headphone jack so I opted for the s8. This is a great phone! I'm sure there are more detailed reviews out there, but overall, I love this phone. Smooth interface, beautiful form factor, headphone jack, no problems using all my apps. I like the unusual screen shape, which is a bit longer than typical, which means you get more screen space without having to deal with a super-wide phone. It does overheat more easily than my earlier Nexus 5 (to be fair, I accidentally took it into a sauna so this is an unusual use case) and there are times when the touch screen isn't quite as responsive as I'd like, but it's a solid phone for the price. I've used multiple apps and functions, hooked it up to Bluetooth speakers and headphones (regular and Bluetooth), connected to multiple WiFi ports, etc. And it's handled all of that pretty comfortably.It's slim and the screen is big so people recommend a case. I bought a super thin Humixx case (red!) that I like, and no problems.
            "
"842","The phone functions quite well and it's performance is nice compared to older phones I've used in the past. Still, the Bixby feature is annoying and the edge screen makes it hard to type. The screen is also hard to protect because many tempered glass screen protectors don't adhere correctly to it. To make matters worse, the Spigen case I bought doesn't seem to provide enough front facing protection. If i drop this thing on its face, its done.Battery is acceptable and it runs most apps fairly quickly. I'm not too impressed with the camera, though it is an improvement over my Nexus 6p.While I'm satisfied with it's performance, I'm a bit annoyed that such a best selling phone gets Android updates quite late. It's not bad but far from breathtaking.

"843","I use TracFone, and was hesitant to buy something so expensive without an ironclad guarantee that this unlocked phone would work.  You have to buy the TracFone Bring Your Own Phone SIM activation kit (I got this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0713WH1Y9/ref=twister_B071G7MDJY?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)  Others before me have written detailed awesome reviews.  I just wanted to put my two cents in that if you use TracFone, this phone will work for you.

"844","This phone is clearly new and IS unlocked.Seller shipped unit right away.the factory box had a nice presentation with phone all the cables/fobs/cords present.I have been using this phone for 3 days now and it is working out perfect.To ge my phone on Straight Talk  I went to their website and chatted with the rep.They sent me a sim card called:  ""Verizon Compatible"" Product Id ""TF256PSIMV9TD""..When it arrived I chatted with rep again -but probably didn't need to do so -.They had me use their website and fill out the activation panels.Basically giving the system the phones MEID the  sim's serial and the money for 1 month service.With that task done, I inserted Sim card into phone and booted it up.I was making calls, and sending texts (both sms and mms) without any issues or hassle.
            "
"845","While the phone itself runs smoothly and isn't drowned in bloatware, looks aesthetic, and is packed with one of the best cell phone cameras I have ever handled, it only took a slide off my bed in order to crack the screen. Unfortunately, the screen on this phone just croaked, rendering it useless, and getting a replacement display will not be cheap.Another thing to note was that the end curvature of the display could be a nuisance, as my hand would wrap around the phone and inadvertently activate the side panel among other things.
            "
"846","Overall it a great phone. But you don't see any performance improvement compared to Snapdragon 820 processor based phones.Always check the seller before placing the order.Pros:Sleek, beautiful phone.Great camera, screen, battery life and call quality.Cons:I am not getting any notification in my fitbit charge 2 even after enabling all available permission for the app / phone factory reset. I think samsung want to promote their Wearables. I can give 5 stars if samsung fix this issue.Full glass body. Handle carefully.Lot of bloatwares with the phone. But you can disable the apps.Awkward position of fingerprint reader.
            "
"847","This is a sharp looking phone. It is the only phone I have ever owned, including the previous galaxies where people have inquired about it because of it's looks. The fingerprint sensor works really well for me and the face recognition is very convenient. My main downside is the software, which might be on Samsung or might be on Android. Specifically, the unlock screen can preview your message as a notification. However, anyone can see this if they look at your lock screen and there is only a notification on or off feature and no way I know to leave the notification on without a preview being displayed. The other issue I have is that there is no quick toggle button for GPS. You have to go into settings and flick it on and off there. One excellent feature is it remembered my wifi networks and their passwords which was always a pain when getting a new phone previously. Not sure if this is a google account feature but kudos to whomever.Camera: ExcellentBattery: So far, excellent. I don't use my phone like crazy but without any battery saving mode I still have at least 30% left at the end of the day.Screen:  Really, really fantastic, though due to its wrap around nature terrifying if you drop your phone and I don't like casesSize: I don't like big phones but this one is okay-ishFeel: Just great and not cheapHeadphone Jack: No idea why it is on the bottom and I think it is awkward if you are using corded headphones to make calls because it changes the orientation, buttons on bottom.Tray SD: Not a fan of this tray crap. Worried about getting it jammed and placing the card correctly. The old system was much better.Bixy Button: Don't use it, no idea but it is annoying if you don't use itAlways On Display: Pretty nice but not necessaryLED Indicator: The best feature and probably one of the only reasons I am brand loyal

"848","Honestly, samsung really hit it big with this one. Although I'm sure the Note 8 is even more impressive, I've found perfection in the S8. Super fast processor, radiant screen that takes up the entire phone, amazing specs and of course the design was well thought through. I'm living it. I won't be buying the s9 because I'll wait till something surpasses this by a mile!!
            "
"849","The phone itself maybe 3 stars. But because Samsung took the ability to keep screen on during a phone call I cannot use it in landscape while on a call. That is so stupid! My Samsung Note 3 and Note 4 both had the ability to keep screen on during a call. I contacted Samsung about the proximity sensor not being able to be turned off during a call and they just said sorry for the inconvenience. They call it inconvenience it basically makes a phone unusable if you want to do two things at the same time. This review isn't just about the Samsung phone it's about the Samsung company I'm never buying a Samsung product ever again!!!Update: the battery expanded and is bulging so much the case broke open. I'm sure if I keep charging it it is going to catch fire. I don't know what kind of quality control Samsung has but their product aren't just bad they are dangerous and unsafe. And calling the company does nothing. I repeat I am never buying a Samsung product again.

"850","** I've decided to update my original review as a year has almost passed. **After following with the Apple fan boy of owning an iPhone, I decided to make the switch to Galaxy as it was cheaper than the iPhone X and I could always expand the storage as needed. Insert a 128 GB microSD card into the phone and I have enough storage for photos, apps, and the likes in addition to the 64 GB of storage the phone already came with. What I don't like when I had an iPhone was that Apple tends to make old device obsolete, slow, or both when a new product comes out. My Galaxy S8 hasn't slowed down one bit or suffer any problems. This is my second phone that I own that supports quick charge (after the S7). I love how I can just leave it on a wireless charging pad and check on it a couple hours later to see it fully charged.Mind you that not all cases can allow quick charge. My wallet style case, for example, has to empty the cards before I can charge it (which is a minor issue). Phone doesn't have a single scratch on it and I'm pretty rough with the phone when at work.

"851","Was reluctant at first but this has proved to be one of my smartest tech purchases this year! Bought used for under $430 from Amazon Warehouse vs the over $800 new price tag from my carrier Verizon (even though this model is 1 gen older than newest galaxy model). Description said repackaged but nothing else about wear and tear. Be careful since some items may have slight damage, every listed used product comes with a pretty accurate description of physical wear so pay attention! Plus buy only through Amazon, even their Warehouse Used Items comes with same great return policy and exchange in case something goes wrong.My phone arrived timely and came repackaged with all accessories. Looks and feels completely brand new! Have been using it all week and it has been working fantastic! Took 10-15 mins to figure out how to transfer service from my old LG phone to this S8 and works flawlessly on my Verizon.Was even able to register warranty on Samsung's official site until next year. Great deal and saved me over $400 from buying new from my phone carrier. Thanks Amazon Warehouse!
            "
"852","I didn't want to spend a thousand dollars, nor did I want to wait to see what the Galaxy 10 had to offer.  This S8 has all the features of a great smartphone, came unlocked so I can use it anywhere in the world, and at a price half that of an iPhone or the S10.

"853","I'm typically a nexus/pixel phone user.  I got this phone as a replacement after my last phone didn't even last past 6 months.  So far it's fine.  There was a bit of a learning curve for me even though it's still android.  There are a bunch of apps preloaded from samsung that I will never use and I'm not really a fan of the curved edge screen.  I'm constantly accidentally hitting the sides while just holding the phone and it will either swipe to a different screen or open an app I didn't mean to open.  However, the screen is very responsive which is (usually) a good thing.  The ""ok google"" voice assistant doesn't work as well as it did with my google phones and I find bixby to be terrible so I've disabled that.  The sound quality is great - actually better compared to my old pixel.  I do wish this phone was slightly smaller.  I have small hands and it's really cumbersome to hold this.
            "
"854","Love it!!! I accidentally dropped it in my dogs bowl of water, fully submerged, two days after I received it and 1 month later still works like a champ, no glitches,  nothing.

"855","Samsung Galaxy S8 Unlocked 64GB - US Version (Midnight Black) - US WarrantyTook a little bit of finagling to get the phone activated via. Verizon called to get sim card shipped, then had to turn off Family Base because it is a carrier-based product.  After researching found this is common with unlocked phones.  But once that was done, phone active and running flawlessly so far.  Big jump from S5 this phone replaced.
            "
"856","So I've owned a Pixil for a couple of years and then put it the washing machine.  Oops. I initially bought the S8, having visited a phone store and really liked the display. It's quite vibrant. However, in accustoming myself to the phone I had problems with ""Hi, Bixby"". Bixby is a 2nd AI on the phone designed to work and perform phone tasks. The 1st AI is ""Ok, Google"". One phone, two AI's and I never found out if they talk to each other. There are 10 levels to Hi, Bixby and I never got past level 3. Another problem was the news feed (which will probably not bother others as it did me) but every headline in the news feed was on top of a photo, so I had to process a picture as well as read a headline printed over variable colors. Add to that, instead of the feed being one box over another box it is in a hop-scotch format: one box over two side-by-side boxes over one box over two side-by-side boxes over....So my eyes have to jump all over the place to read a headline. Too much effort was required by me to read a line. The last problem I couldn't get over was the alarm volume. Can't get to the volume slide without setting an alarm to go off. The slide does not show up in the drop down menu for volume control. Nowhere could I find it in settings. And for the two daily alarms I have, lowering the volume doesn't remain low. It always went back to a default level. So I have returned this phone and got another Pixil.
            "
"857","Awesome phone, I have seen some people say they got ripped off or not everything was in the box. You have to buy it from Amazon not another seller, that's what I did and it was brand new. Phone is really nice bit screen but it's thinner than most phones in a good way. No negative complaints so far. Had a few galaxies in the past and iPhones I switch every other phone between the two companies and this is probably the best galaxy yet I would say, the bixby button is annoying though.
            "
"858","If WiFi Calling worked, I'd have kept this phone.  Unfortunately, even though the online user manual states how to use wi-fi calling, for this specific model, it is not available, for this specific model.  (Unlocked, re: unlocked user manual states it is a feature, and it is not due to software incompatibilites, which is likely a non-FCC compliant issue with the software!).So good luck to anyone that wants this phone.  It works splendidly aside from not having what it claims within its own user manual.  Since that was about 75% of the reason I got the phone, it's getting returned.
            "
"859","Amazing phone. Just about every thing of this phone is better than the top end of iPhones. Better screen. More memory. Expansion slot. Better form. +Fingerprint sensor. Great iris sensor, and a good face detection. Better software controls because unlike iOS, android gives you a lot of control over so many aspects of user experience.I used to be an iPhone user for many years but finally got bored of the lackluster hardware, and being dictated what I should want from my phone. I use a standard ear phones, and expect my phone to honor my wishes.
            "
"860","After 14.5 months of use. The battery is still strong. The buttons still work great.The only Problem: The phone randomly restarts about 4 times a week. Which is a little annoying because sometimes the phone doesn't recognize the SD card after one of those random restarts. This forces me to restart the phone again to mount the SD card
            "
"861","Bought this phone after Batteries Plus set my phone, Galaxy S7, on fire replacing the battery. This phone gets terrible cell reception and drops calls all the time, despite being in an area where cell reception/coverage is excellent. I ""assumed"" the advertised Samsung US limited warranty was a 1 year, not the case.So, went and got a new SIM card and after it got acclimated to my area, the reception is as I would expect it to be. However, this doesn't change the fact that attempting to get the phone warranted is still extremely difficult/next to impossible. Overall, I'm happy with how the phone is performing now and I think the S8 is a very economical choice for someone not needing the latest greatest phone. Buyer beware of this purchase and consider what a new phone costs vs. how much hassle a used phone may be if you aren't tech savvy.
            "
"862","I don't like how ever since I've gotten this it constantly closes apps without me actually closing it. It glitches, so I'm factory resetting the phone in order just to use it. Resetting only works for about an hour. I got 65 gigs of space but when I add more apps or even photos it gets extremely slow. It would be better if I just got the 16 gigs. I have been downloading multiple apps to speed it up or take off viruses. They dont work well. Maybe I'm miss using but using this phone gets me frustrated.  I thought about giving it a few months just to fully get into the phone and I havent been able to stop the app closing and the glitching. I got more space than a 16 gig to use, not just to say I have 65 gigs of space.

"863","I have been using apple product for a while and have gotten used to them. I am still getting used to this phone.Pros:It takes better pictures than my Iphone 6.It seems to have a better battery life (for now)You can buy your own additional memory without paying apple.Cons: Be prepared to buy yet another charger cable.You will need to download some of your apps or have to search for a new one.You will have to search for some of your photos, mine got jumbled up. I didn't lose them but I couldn't find them too easily.

"864","The screen is incredible.  One of the best Android phones out there if not the best.  Camera is great in low light situations.  Battery life is good and lasts me the whole day.  Also has a quick charging feature if you use supported Qualcomm quick charge adapters.  Only thing that annoys me is the Bixby feature.  I basically have disabled it and switched over to the Google Assistant.  Default Samsung applications for basic smart phone use are very good and minimalistic.  For example the calendaring, contacts, and messaging apps all support the basic needed functionality well.  Best thing though is the screen when you are watching HighDef video content or viewing your photos.  Really clear when you've got the right content.

"865","Was a great phone while it worked!  Very speedy, very customizable, great screen.  Loved it!..  I took VERY good care of it.  Never dropped it, never submerged it, careful about overcharging, etc..  However, 2 months out of warranty.  The phone was just sitting on the table, and just went dark.  Wouldn't turn back on, wouldn't charge (qi or usb), wouldn't boot to recovery, no nothing.  Took it to UBreakIFix, and it was listed as ""no signs of life"".  dead.  Hopefully this was just a fluke, but still frustrating.

"866","Switched from an iPhone 8 plus and have not been able to put it down. Beats the iPhone in every way. The radio reception is amazing as well. That goes for the cellular, wifi, bluetooth and gps. Such an awesome phone. It just works and the battery life is amazing. Samsung has done some nice touches to android. I love how bixby can help you optimize your phone for better battery life and clear the ram and cash. The build quality of this thing is amazing. Even beats apple. I would even recommend this phone in 2018. Yeah the S9 is coming but if you don't want the latest and greatest this phone is really worth a look.

"868","I've only had the phone for a few hours, but I can confirm that it CAN be activated on Verizon.  I bought 2 phones, went into my local store to get one of them activated.  The clerk provided a SIM card and got it running in just a few minutes (but be prepared to spend two or three hours reloading your apps and configuring the phone's options).Waited to set up my second phone until my wife got home this evening.  I was planning on doing it myself online, but had a minor issue finding the right numbers on the phone itself (the online tool wasn't accepting the numbers).  I used Verizon's online chat, and the operator had it up and running in just a few minutes.  No problems.
            "
"869","As good as they say, far as I can tell. Very responsive, good storage capacity, The UI is good, cameras are outstanding compared to the average phone. The fingerprint scanner's position next to the camera is not so hard to get used to, and there's a biometric scanner as well if you're interested in health readings like heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. Preloaded apps aren't intrusive, and don't clutter the system much.
            "
"870","Works great. Only problem I ran into was not knowing that this phone uses a nano sim instead of a micro sim, so I had to convert my sim card to the smaller size. I cut it down with scissors and it did the job. If you don't feel confident in your cutting abilities, you can go to a cell phone shop and ask them to cut it down for you. Phone is fast and was easy to set up. Works well with T-mobile.
            "
"871","Only my 2nd day, but I think it's as expected.  The phone arrived in what appeared to be a new box, I swapped the SIM, but the phone didn't ask the expected start up questions. My AT&T GO plan connected immediately on it's own. So I logged into my gmail account to establish the protection I read about and then took it to the AT&T store to reset to factory default. Process was easy to reset, and then the phone started asking all the startup questions. So I think I'm happy.

"873","I bought this over the GS9 because the price is more than $100 cheaper, and it's the exact same phone as the GS9.There are very MINOR, SUBTLE differences.

"875","So far I love it.... After months of listening to my family tell me to retire my NEXUS 6 - Amazon made it easy [price-wise] for me to do just that. e phone is way smaller - something I have to get used to, but lightening quick with responses.  The camera is great..I've only had it for 2 days, but it is pretty neat - so far.  Pairs effortlessly with my car stereo and has many 'modern' features.... So far, so good...LOL  If I should fall out of love with it - I will share that, too!
            "
"876","Bought this phone as an upgrade from my previous phone. To put it bluntly, this thing is amazing. The way it feels in my hand is excellent. Now I have normal hands for a guy, so if you have smaller hands it may be a little big, but for me it was a perfect fit. The camera is a huge upgrade from my previous phone. The details are so crystal clear. The insane amount of settings really lets you customize your phone to what you want. The only thing I have to mention is Bixby. I turned mine off and downloaded the Google Assistant, but aside from that I literally cannot brag about this phone. If you're on the fence about it, just get it. Now I bought mine when it was $600, which as I'm writing this review Amazon has them priced at $720, so you might want to keep an eye on the price. But again, highly recommended. Amazing upgrade. Coworkers are jealous.

"877","Works with my Sprint account although I did have to go to the store to get a new SIM card in order for it to work but I was in and out of Sprint and 5-10 minutes. I tried to activate it at home and it wouldn't recognize that I was using a Galaxy S7 SIM card and it kept thinking it was a Galaxy S5. But nice phone just need to stop at the Sprint store take you 5 or 10 minutes if they're not busy and you'll be on your way good phone so far

"878","I love this phone,  this is the replacement of an iphone 5 and I don't miss it at all.  Before buying the Samsung Galaxy S8 I was debating if I should get the Iphone 8 instead but Apple's strategy of releasing 3 phones a couple months apart just didn't make sense to me, it makes you think.  After reading reviews explaining how Samsung has been releasing phones for years with technology that Apple now says is revolutionary with their Iphone X,  my decision was easily made... the S8 is an excellent phone with all the bells and whistles for an amazing price.

"879","My phone is amazing. The battery life is awesome. It charges super fast and takes maybe 2 seconds to launch apps. The screen is crystal clear and the resolution is very beautiful.

"883","I know posting this review after only a day of usage might seem bad to do, but I love the phone. I got the phone, had Verizon pop my Sim card in and it was ready to use. No hassle or anything. The phone flies through anything. The curved screen allows for you to grip it easily and is a pleasure to look at with the sharp screen when reading or watching videos. My only concern down the line would be the battery, but I carry a power bank with me anyways so thats a minor grip. Thank you Amazon for the great price. I loved my S6 but this phone has Wob me over.
            "
"884","This is, by far, the best phone that Samsung has produced. I believe it is even better than the Galaxy S9 because of the waterproof rating of IP68 versus the Galaxy S9 rating of IP67. All in all, it is a strong and powerful phone.
            "
"885","Bought this version here directly from Amazon. So far so good.For those wondering it does not have wi-fi calling. And although the item was bought here in the States and is the US Version, Samsung did not found the product's IMEI, therefore you can't register it at Samsung, so no warranty. I received a discount because of this.
            "
"886","Awesome phone. I got it when it was on sale for $575 and it hasn't failed me yet. I love the fact that it's unlocked so I could pretty much pop any sim card into it and have service. I really wanted it in orchid gray but the black was on sale for significantly cheaper (I believe the full price is about $750-800) so I stuck with that one. The battery life lasts me all day even through my heavy use. It hasn't died on me yet.
            "
"887","The phone itself seems fine but when it arrived it was out of the packaging and the phone box was covered in scores/dents. Not quite sure what the deal is but it was unprofessional and makes me wonder if the phone is really new?

"888","The phone is great responds great the only problem and its why i decided to go with the S8 is that the VoLTE is not available. I checked before ordering even one of the reviews says it works but I cant get it to work at all. I decided to keep the phone because I am switching providers within the next few months and rather not buy another phone.
            "
"889","**CAVEAT EMPTOR** My phone and phone box were labelled with the wrong MEID number. When I called Sprint to activate, they told me it wasn't unlocked, so you can imagine my frustration. I finally figured out that if you dial *#06#, it will show you your phone's serial number, MEID #, and IMEI#, which turned out was different than what was on the box or the back of the phone. When I then called Sprint to activate with the actual number and my Sprint SIM card, and everything worked out fine.As to the phone itself, it's great. The screen is nice and large, responsive, good speakers, I like the water resistant design, and the swag is great (comes with the charger w/ USB cable, a transfer USB set to transfer info from your old Samsung phone, and a set of headphones. One of the best things about this phone is that it has NONE of the bloatware that comes with Sprint phones that can't be disabled or turned off.Overally, outside of the hassle, this is a great deal on a great phone.

"890","Its been 6 months now, so i guess that makes me qualified to give a review. Amazing piece by Samsung, its fast, great color production on display, and a screen which is the best in the market. No issues with multitasking though it gets a lil slower if you open up 15-20 apps at a time, (that is bound to happen for any Android one which you buy). Love the latest Snapdragon, played a lot of graphic intensive games but it hasn't underperformed in any of them..Thanks to Amazon, happy with my buy. Will stay with me for years hopefully !

"902","Exactly as described - unlocked and new in box. Some of the other reviews had me concerned this was going to be a refurb that was prior locked to a carrier. That was not the case. I followed the link direct from Samsung's website to this listing.
            "
"903","Galaxy is always right
            "
"904","Nice memory great storage some new features great sound and pictures. The only thing I don't like is it does not have and I. R. can't use it as a remote for regular TV and other electronic devices. Like the s5 and s4. The permanent battery such too that will cost a lot of money to replace in the future.
            "
"905","I had to buy a new sim card because my old one was too small, works perfectly with Straight Talk and had zero issues using it for the last month or so. I love this phone! It's so nice to hold, amazing picture quality, everything about it is so nice. (Just disable Bixby button on press and your good to go!) 10/10 would recommend.
            "
"906","Just received and hope this Samsung works as well as my last one.  Do not buy an LG phone, stick with Samsung (learned this one the hard way).  Slim fit in hand even with protective case on, so I love the size.  Time will tell if Samsung has maintained its quality.
            "
"907","Accidently broke my phone and needed a replacement.  This one works exactly like my last one and saved my self a couple 100 bucks. Compatible with sprint. Perfect new condition!
            "
"908","most breakable phone I have ever owned. Do not like Bixby & if you enable it other setting get jacked up. the edges make it difficult to hold without triggering certain apps unintentionally.  I have never been so dissatisfied with a phone (this is the 3rd or 4th Galaxy I have invested in & I have LOVED the rest  :-()
            "
"909","This phone has been amazing! I purchased it when it was roughly $550. Retail price was $850 with T-Mobile (ridiculous)! Overall the phone has worked amazing. Only complaint is that the screen protectors for this phone (purchased separately) makes it super hard to type.Overall, love this phone!!!
            "
"910","Ordered phone, received it, took it to my local sprint store.  They swapped out 2 phones I had on our Sprint Plan, sold me sim cards for $2.99, transferred all the info from old phones to new phones and we are extremely pleased with the whole process.  We had never purchased an ""Unlocked Phone"" and we did not have any problem using the phones on Sprint.
            "
"911","Great phone. Seller should specify exact model number. Mine is SM-G950U1
            "
"912","I like the phone very much.  Would recommend it to others.  Light weight, easy to use even for a person of my advanced years.  I do wish the punctuation marks like the question and exclamation marks were on the main keyboard.  I am hearing impaired and don't use the audio at all so I can't speak to that. The picture quality is excellent and it's easy to navigate.
            "
"913","I bought an open box return. It was just like new. I like the size of the phone. It's a little bit longer but, it is thinner. That makes it easier to hold. It came unlocked and I was able to get it on my cell phone provider's network without any problems or surprises.
            "
"914","Works with Verizon.
            "
"915","Omg this is everything I want in a phone! It's super quick, battery lasts forever, lots of room, it really is unlocked. I took it to Verizon and it works just fine. Only I saved a couple hundred dollars and didn't get Verizon's bloatware.
            "
"916","Read reviews and various positive comment ... all are true and useful for decision making! One bit lower, keyboard only English .. that is unfortunate, should have a version with 2 languages and more with predictable and dictionary features available!
            "
"917","So far so good as a replacement phone for the Amazon Fire Phone I've had for 4 years.  Working out the details of learning it, I have not tried to register yet to ensure a warranty was available  It arrived timely and looked brand new.
            "
"918","We love the phone, but unfortunately most likely will be our last Samsung phone unless they remove the Bixby button or allow us to disable it without creating a account. If I knew then what I know now, I would of went with a Google Phone.
            "
"919","The best phone at any price right now.  I'm looking forward to next year when I may go for the Samsung Note.  I was a ten year iPhone user and finally lost patience with Tim Cook and his mediocre product development.  He's no Steve Jobs, not by a long shot...  This is the best phone and still has a proper headphone jack.  Until bluetooth headphones can make it a few days on one charge and can fit in my pocket as compactly as a small set of wired earbuds, I will continue to use a phone with a regular headphone jack.  With Apple and now Google Pixel phones committing to what is obviously a very controversial move, it seems like there may be a bigger agenda.  Maybe one of you software engineers can figure out what is the huge advantage of taking away a feature of the phone without adding to it.  Seems like maybe there is some larger reason, like maybe the bluetooth  headsets allow the companies to track you differently.  Maybe the headsets communicate with every wifi device in the world and tell them what you are doing.  I just don't get why they go out of their way to remove it, when it obviously still fits.  Samsung did it, but these other companies can't?  Got to be more to it.
            "
"920","I was unable to register this product in my Samsung  product web. It's IMEI or so number was not accepted, unlike order Samsung Galaxy phones from another supplier,  why?
            "
"921","Ever since changing from iPhone to a Samsung phone, I have never been happier. Now my whole family uses Samsung phones, from Galaxy s7 to s9+. My kiddo really like this s7, which is an upgrade from the Note 5.
            "
"922","Charged normally first few days. Suddenly the battery stopped charging. Burning metal smell was emanating from charging port. Otherwise, the phone seemed fine. The edges did not really improve the whole screen. Camera is really good. Price was reasonable as the phone itself is on its way to obsoletion.
            "
"923","I really love this phone it's pretty fast great for some emulating gaming I may get it activated with Metro by tmobile got this as a upgrade from my S7 I will give it 9/10 base on the condition has a few scratches on screen but that's expected because it was used .
            "
"924","I like the S8, replaces an S3. Lots to figure out, but not much difference.  I have not figured out how to set message tone for contacts. Other than that all good.
            "
"925","Love love love it! I replaced a Samsung J3 from AT&T with this this high end S8. The J3 just didn't have what it takes to operate the WIFI in my new apartment building ""fortress"". The Amazon price for this unlocked S8 cannot be beat - $300 less than anywhere else! As directed by AT&T I only had to insert the Sim card from my J7 and it was good to go instantly! I couldn't be happier with my unlocked S8 at this spectacular Amazon Prime price!
            "
"926","The one that was sent to me did not operate well and the camera was subpar
            "
"927","Phone worked well for the first 4 months. Now I have to keep it attached to the charger most of the day because it charges slowly and drains quickly. It's become really slow, and sometimes the audio has issues so I have to restart it often.
            "
"928","S7 Edge screen broke so I picked this up and preferred the size/feel over the plus.  What an awesome device, incredible how quickly we move on to the ""next best thing"" this phone is still A+!  Download Nova Launcher and you have the finest phone on the market
            "
"929","Too many stupid initialization pop ups that keep happening as new things are opened and used. Too many things already turned on for notifications for evaluate businesses and apps. Otherwise it's great
            "
"930","Best phone I've ever owned. Screen is beautiful. Camera excellent. And yes, it had an FM antenna not requiring WiFi or mobile data to hear local FM stations. Samsung apps are excellent great improvements over stock Android.
            "
"931","Great product, fast, stylish. The only thing I complained is that the text on the phone edge is somewhat warped. We are using AT&T cellular service and the phone works well.
            "
"932","Perfect. I' m very happy with my new Samsung it's new. I love it.
            "
"933","So far I am very please with this phone. Shipping, packaging, quality are all great.

"934","Too smart for me absolutely great phone

"935","Work great in us with t mobile. Just popped in my sim and it worked. Has 4glte and the fm radio feature is great.

"936","Best phone I've ever owned very fast great screen and sound just awsome.
            "
"937","LOVE THIS PHONE SO MUCH. Got to me fast and was easy to set up.Price cheaper then other places.
            "
"938","The best phone available. Just wish Samsung would drop the Bixby stuff. Also Samsung does not believe in cutting edge Android so it is running an older version than my old phone.
            "
"939","As expected.  Fast.  Have owned many Samsung Galaxy phones and all have been great
            "
"940","Good product, nothing wrong with and was easy to connect service. Works good.
            "
"941","Excellent condition as described. Unlocked model so there's no bloatware. I'm happy with this purchase.
            "
"942","Took a bit to get use to but its been amazing.
            "
"943","Does not have the original lamination and the packaging is a little different. i have bought bought 3 s8+ and a note 8 so I know.
            "
"944","So far, so good, this phone does so much more then I would have imagined, as well as things I never could imagine. Its way smarted then I am.
            "
"945","Awesome phone!!!Pros:Amazing (super amazing) displayawesome aesthetics (the phone is very sleek)lightweightCons:Awkward position for a fingerprint sensor.I heard screen breaks pretty easily (I ordered screen protector and a case for this phone, although my earlier phones didn't require one)
            "
"946","Bought as a gift for my elderly father. Works much better than the LG4 and without issue.
            "
"947","I love this phone, it is so nice and easy to use. Perfect screen size , I just love it
            "
"948","Just the right size: not to large to hold easily and not too small to have to strain to see.  All the bells and whistles I'll need for awhile!
            "
"949","This phone came with virus loaded software from seller. Virus is called ZZU, plus one that is written in Asian characters.
            "
"950","Awesome phone except the bixby button.
            "
"951","Been using for about 6months. I always like Samsung products in general. Its good
            "
"952","No issues and takes even nicer photos than my last phone.
            "
"953","Two thumbs up! Works as expected, connects with all my smart gadgets, long battery life, Durable screen (I'm a klutz so this has been tried and tested but the screen has not cracked)
            "
"954","Not even a month after buying it died and completely stopped charging, now I'm 700$ short and I don't have a phone, very disappointed
            "
"955","The phone is amazing and the delivery was really fast!The phone arrived in perfections conditions.Galaxy 8 is a beautiful cell phone and the camera can take some gorgeous pictures.I would definitely recommend it.
            "
"956","After 3 years I had to upgrade from an S6 and the S8 is great. Love all the newer features, unlock with face, and endless customization settings. Picture/sound all great.
            "
"957","Works great and everything that I was looking for
            "
"958","It's a great phone. It replaced my Samsung Mega 4. I like it.
            "
"959","Good enough function and performance for the price you paid.
            "
"960","Worst phone ever. Samsung is worst service. Do not buy this/Samsung products. Software updates ruin the phone and due to purchasing via Amazon the service isn't good. It's US Warranty phone but doesn't cover the same as a store bought or direct Samsung bought. Bought it 3 months ago and still suffering with a non functional phone.
            "
"961","This is best experience of all the smart phones I have tried yet and I have tried all from iPhone 3s,Nokia Lumia till iphone 7 and many more in the mix.
            "
"962","Please know that my phone previous to this was a Droid Razr Max XT912.  After owning this new Samsung Galaxy S8 for a couple weeks now, there really is no comparison to my old phone.  It's almost like going from a black and white 13"" TV with rabbit ear antennas to a 39"" HD flat screen with high speed cable.  I only mention this to offer perspective in the event some feel I have over fluffed this product in my review.The phone arrived precisely as advertised.  Neatly boxed with instructions, corded head-set, charger with USB adapter fittings, and Sim/SD card remover tool.  Upon removal from the box I could find no flaws or blemishes.  It started right up and had a 50% charge on the battery.  I was immediately able to connect it to my high speed home wifi.  Afterwards, I just browsed a bit on the internet to get a feel for it and immediately noticed that it was insanely faster than my previous phone but the biggest glaring difference was the clarity and crispness of the display.Not wanting to tempt fate, I forced myself to stop playing with it long enough to get it in a protector case and apply a glass protector to the face.  Even with the glass protector, there was no noticeable difference in the display.  The sound was very sharp as well.I played around with it a bit more but then had to run over to the Verizon store to get them to put a SIM card in it since I already had a service plan with them.  Once I got there, it literally took 5 minutes for a Verizon representative to find my account and put a new SIM card in the phone.  After that it was a simple restart and I was full connected.  After I returned home I was able to download all of my previous content from the Verizon cloud using my high speed wifi.  After that it was business as usual except now it was faster, cleaner, sharper, and just all-around better than that old Droid Razr Max.I admit though that I can't bring myself to ditch Google voice for Bixby.  I have heard from many that Bixby doesn't compare so I haven't tried it.  If there is an issue with the phone it is that I sometimes accidently enable Bixby with an inadvertent swipe in the wrong direction or tap of the button on the bottom left side.  I will eventually try it out an update this review later.After having the phone a couple of weeks now, I am still extremely please with this phone.  I've had no performance issues whatsoever.  Navigating through the net, apps, settings, etc. is quite painless.  Photos are very clear even with my unsteady hands.  I will update this review with anything I feel is worthy later.  Good or bad.  Right now I highly recommend this phone if you are looking for one.
            "
"963","Love the size and picture quality. Do not like the Bixby key that that you are unable to disabled unless you create a Samsung account
            "
"964","Great phone! My husband likes it a lot and it has a nice camera too.
            "
"965","Excellent fit as usual. Slight ridge on sides sometimes interferes with buttons but no biggie. Very good access to the fingerprint scanner which is a weakness of their main competitor--a crucial plus if this is what you rely on to turn on the screen. 'Grippiness' comes with time as finger oils penetrate the back. Good product.
            "
"966","This is the first time I got a new phone and wasn't upset about it.
            "
"967","Great Battery compared to previous versions. Sound it send to different speakers/headphones vary.

"972","This was perfect,  no scratches or imperfections.  Thank you
            "
"973","Samsung told me it's not original and didn't want to update or touch anything.
            "
"974","So happy with price and phone.  Registered fine and I'm very happy with purchase.
            "
"975","I used to have a windows phone now I have this I  Am glad I upgraded
            "
"976","Fast, good looking, good size, long battery, good sound, great camera, huge storage, never brakes. Didn't activated Bixby, however.
            "
"977","Pros:- gorgeous display ( seriously you will fall in love with this bezeless beauty)- So many helpful and useful features that I never knew I wanted/needed- Insane battery life- Unlimited customization options- More storage than you'll ever need, plus sd slot in case you somehow need more- The list goes on and onCons: (Small things but worth noting)- Dedicated ""Bixby"" button is annoying if accidentally pressed- Slick (can be fixed with skin or case)- Fingerprint sensor is in kind of a weird spot (especially for left-handed users)All in all every second of using this phone had been an absolute pleasure!
            "
"978","You'll probably have to activate it yourself because Verizon personnel seem to be ignorant about what to do with these.  Luckily it is very easy to do. Love, love, love this phone.
            "
"979","Love the phone.  No useless Verizon apps.  Great price!

            "
"982","Love this phone, completely unlocked. I can make a WiFi hotspot with it which is great. I use a straight talk sim card.
            "
"983","Great deal, Verizon will act stupid when you try to switch your phone. They will assume it is a prepaid, just tell Verizon to shut up and put a sim card in it. Very happy with this deal!
            "
"984","Great phone. A lot less expensive then buying from Verizon Wireless. Works great!
            "
"985","Slow charging / please use original charger messages appear when plugged in.

"1001","Samsung S8 should be named the Kim Kardashian selfie phone.  This phone came with bloatware that cannot be turn off.  Especially irritating is the automatic selfie application that kicks in frequently when you're getting ready to capture an important camera shot.  There seems to be no solution to turning off the selfie mode application.  If there is, please let me know.  Not worth the money..

"1073","As advertised, very good transaction.
            "
"1074","I received the phone with open packaging. There was no seal on the phone and protective thin film on the phone packaging was also missing.It seems like I received the phone returned by someone else.

"1077","Unfortunately this phone, when activated with Verizon Wireless, is not capable of utilizing the Advanced Calling Features. This includes video calling and is very disappointing for me. I have another S8 work phone purchased from Verizon and the advanced calling works well. Verizon technicians have attempted to resolve and thus far have been unsuccessful. I would have rather paid additional money and had all the features available to me. The phone works fine otherwise, but this issue leaves me very disappointed with this purchase.
            "
"1078","I am disappointed, Is it unlocked ? Because it doesn't really work as a phone. I mean it's main function is to call,  but it doesn't see my sim card, I have no network connection, even though it was set up to the carrier instructions. My other phone works fine with the same settings and simcard.
            "
"1079","Love
            "
"1080","Love the S8, and shipping here was fast.
            "
"1081","They said new, but...... it didn't have a plastic seal on it, and the screen cover has been tempered with.... but not scratches. Which was really satisfying to look at
            "

"1083","Best phone ever.

"1084","Can't wait for the s9 to come out.
            "
"1085","I have been a IPhone user for some years but got feed up with the prices Apple charges. so I went with Samsung, The camera is very good the screen quality is great. the reason I only give it 3 stars is the edge screen is very easy to touch and easily changes things just by holding the phone.A few things that bug me might have to do with user control. For example having different sounds for different apps,Facebook,messanger,emails and so on does not seem to work or at least I have not made it happen. At the moment I seem to get a ring or ding but then when I go to check my phone I have nothing showing I have missed a message. Again this could be me so if I can figure this phone out I will happily update my review.
            "
"1086","It was nice and quick and wasn¡¯t damage it¡¯s a great buy
            "
"1087","Absolutely love my phone.

"1088","Very nice
            "
"1089","Bought this used from HTownGadgets and I'm very very happy with it.The shipping was faster than expected, and the phone is in better condition than expected.Everything was transferred easily from my Galaxy S5, and I had no problem with setup through AT&T. Phone is smooth and just what I wanted from the Galaxy S8.The only thing really making this phone differ from a new one is the battery life. It's still miles above what I was getting on my S5, but it does die faster than it would if it was new (which is to be expected).Overall, I would not hesitate to by another device from HTown in the future.
            "
"1090","Excellent
            "
"1091","Fantastic phone. I haven't own a Galaxy phone since the S3. I went to iPhone and now I'm back on Galaxy and oh boy this phone is great. There are so many features on this phone that it would take me hours to explain them all in detail. They are great. From wireless charging, fast charging, the Iris scanner, and the gorgeous display. The screen has Gorilla Glass 5 and it's not easy to ruin with scratches. Be careful with buying screen protectors though with a case because thanks to the edges, cases will lift up the screen protectors from the bottom so you will need to find screen protectors that are case compatible. That was only problem I suppose that i've had so far. Otherwise, the phone is amazing and you won't be disappointed.
            "
"1092","I love this phone....
            "
"1093","Great phone!
            "
"1094","Received quickly, phone activated with no issues on Sprint network since I had ordered the SIM at the same time. Beautiful phone!
            "
"1095","Here is the thing, the phone works fine and I am really happy with the S8. However, when it arrived there was no seal on the box, and after I completed the install I noticed that it was already associated with another email account. The original protective stickers were attached, so it seems more like it was returned by the previous owner, but it is really inappropriate to sell a used phone as new.
            "
"1096","Slowest phone on wifi I have EVER used! It's not the wifi either because my husband's Galaxy s6 edge runs on the wifi in our house perfectly. EVERY other phone is fine. This one is so slow I give up and stop using it. I hate it. Everything else about this phone is great.
            "
"1097","Why was I so loyal to the iPhone for so long?  The Galaxy makes the iPhone look like a toy that you would give to a small child to keep them busy.  I love this phone...  Every aspect of it blows Apple away...  I even went to the Apple store to check out the iPhone X - side by side the Galaxy still looks 10 times better..  I love it.  Customization...  Removable memory.  The best phone on the planet.
            "
"1098","The phone itself is fine.  But because it's an unlocked phone, Verizon does not allow wifi calling.  I have no service a work.  And will not notify you if there is voicemail in your inbox.  Instead you have to call your voicemail every day to make sure you didn't miss anything.  Driving me CRAZY.  So I say it's not worth it, and to go get your locked phone from your service provider provider.
            "
"1099","This phone is not fully featured like the phones sold by the wireless companies here in the U.S.  It's usable. however, if you want all the bells and whistles, this isn't the phone.  If you are happy with less, this phone fine.  It wasn't until set up, missing features were noticed.  An example, a landscape option for viewing or texting.
            "
"1100","KNOWN ISSUES WITH TEXTING - read the Samsung forums before buying this phone. I sent my 2 month old phone in for repair when it stopped sending texts after a security update, and it was supposedly repaired but is still not working! Tech support and Sales pointed fingers at one another and have given me the runaround and refused a refund. Hard to believe Samsung hasn't improved their customer support after the S7 debacle. So far I've wasted hundreds of dollars on a paperweight and hours of my time on the phone with Samsung. Buy a reliable but inexpensive Moto G5 plus instead if you require texting capabilities on your phone!
            "
"1101","Would give 0 if I could!  Received phone, all it does is reboot constantly, before I was able to even set it up!  Cannot get past wifi screen without it rebooting.  Samsung is of no help.  Reading online, this issue has existed for 8 months and they are still shipping defective phones without a fix.  I will be returning this POS, and will get an iPhone instead.  Shame on you Samsung!
            "
"1102","Does a perfect cell phone even exist?  This phone has some little annoying things about it.  Nothing too major I can think of right now.  One is the ugly emojis.  I liked the ones on my old Droid way better.
            "
"1103","Less than a year and the phone has stopped taking charge
            "
"1104","I installed two of these; one went on great, the other not so great.  one is curled up a little at the bottom.  This occurred when I put the protective case back on the phone.  The material is durable and the curled portion does not affect the function, just the appearance.
            "
"1105","I love this phhone.It works perfectly on both my local service provider here in the bahamas.

"1107","Yes works with Verizon wireless!
            "
"1108","Too much junk on the phone
            "
"1109","Well, screen cracked with just one week and a half old. Just one fall. Unable to use it anymore. I feel disappointed and angry about how cellphone business has become. Sell fragile devices and charge a fortune for a replacement. Around $300, because basically the phone is a single unit, so they have to change almost everything, even the battery (because of their exploding batteries history, they must replace it) You get what you pay for? doesn't apply here.
            "
"1110","Just as described!
            "
"1111","I have used androids for many years now.  I was not impressed with this phone at all. Visual Voicemail would not work, talk to text never worked and I would have to constantly reboot to get it to work only to have it go out after a couple messages.  Would not work with call recorder or other voice recorder. It would record some messages and some messages it would not. all of the Samsung bloatware was just way too much as well.  Simply not impressed.
            "
"1112","Returned it because it doesn't have wifi calling and that's the only reason I bought it. It's a great phone just spend the extra money at the carrier's store and wifi calling works.
            "
"1113","This, made in Vietnam, model replaced my beloved, well served s4. Like the s4, the s8 represented big changes in cell phone tech. At $750 last year, $500 this year is a bargain. So far so good. Connected to Net10 in minutes.
            "
"1114","Great product,but my older one  Sam. 5 one picked whi fi a lot, this needs a much stronger signl,  darn!
            "
"1115","I purchased this because it was a US unlocked phone and could be used in the US and abroad. I have Verizon as a service and although the phone wotks, it has issues because it is made for Sorint service.
            "
"1116","Love Samsung products! This is my 3rd android from Samsung, and each upgrade just keeps getting better. Good price, too!
            "
"1117","The phone is amazing rather for some rattling that happens when you shake it. The headphones broke shortly after a day of use which is bad specially for $100 headphones, didn't do anything to them, just normal use and they broke.
            "
"1118","My husband got this for himself and took it to the Verizon store and had them sit it up.
            "
"1119","stop now!

"1120","After years on iPhone, my wife finally got on board an Android phone and she's enjoying every minute of it!

"1123","Shipping was dismal. But the phone was as advertised and we'll boxed with all the proper items. Would definitely buy this again.
            "
"1124","I was about to get the Samsung S8 Note if it was cheaper but I got this instead. Tons of features and just an overall satisfaction with the aesthetics
            "
"1125","This is the best and most beautiful phone I've had. Hands down a sight of beauty.
            "
"1126","If you have Verizon, don't expect to be able to use wi-fi calling.  :-(

"1137","The phone came the same day, thanks to amazons hardworking employees. The phone is great looks slick and works amazingly.
            "
"1138","The most fragile phone I've ever owned. Such a piece of junk! My S5 lasted 3 years without a scratch and this has a broken screen from a 2 foot fall! Fell out of my pocket while sitting in a chair and the screen is shattered. Will never buy another Samsung product, even though my home is filled with them.Edit: I've been having fun destroying this POS phone since the first break. It's now virtually impossible to read the screen and the sad part is how simple it was to get it to this point. A couple of ""accidental"" drops and the screen is completely trashed! Almost worth the price of the phone for the pleasure of reducing it to what it really is,,, garbage.

"1146","Great product, fast shipping.
            "
"1147","Love the s8 phone itself.  I had destroyed my first one and bought this one to replace it. I have Verizon wireless as my carrier. So i got this unlocked one. You loose some Verizon features like visual voice mails that I did not realize upon buying. But now after a month of use the Wi-Fi stopped work. Shows it's connected  until you try and load a webpage or use an app the Wi-Fi crashes and has to restart and connect.  Will continue to do so and the page will not load till you turn Wi-Fi off. Leaving me pretty dissatisfied with a 1 month old phone.
            "
"1148","The camera is great but the phone itself....negative.  The glass on this phone is very fragile.  Even in a case this phone is fragile. Most cases cannot protect the infinity screen.  Visit Samungs website and go to the community forum and look for broken screens.  I wish I had before my purchase.  I shattered the back and it is costing me $70 to repair.  And of course if there is physical damage it voids the warranty.  So use super thin glass and then sit back and collect the repair money. I guess they had to make up for the Note 7 somehow.
            "

"1152","If there's a negative zero i will choose that for this item.I trusted Amazon LLC to be selling efficient devices and I was wrong.It's hardly 3 months since I purchased this item and its not working.i could hardly hear people I am talking to on the phone so i had to use a speaker to hear them.so you can't afford to have a private conversation.I emailed amazon about the issue and because its way pass the return period they didn't help.Warning to those purchasing this item think a million times don't waste your money.Think where its safer to buy cellphones.I believe in Karma what goes around will come around.

"1166","the phone in itself is fine. i bought this with a trade in phone so supposedly i was getting $125 for the old phone. well, a month later, samsung sales came back to say sorry, your item does not qualify for trade in so we charging you 125 dollars extra. i asked to return the s8 here as clearly this was now beyond my budget. well, you wish. they said i had only 15 days after the purchase day to return it so i am stuck now with an over priced item. i am still reporting Samsung to the Federal Trade Commission to try to resolve this issue (after all, how was i supposed to return within 15 days when they rejected the item a month later, clearly the 15 days should apply to the moment the buyer has all the final costs charged). anyways beware of the dirty tricks that samsung plays with the customer. if you come to rely on their support, you may as well be on your own.

"1168","overall after having this device for a little while it is a decent device clean video playback and great camera however the few minor issues keeping this from being a higher review the back glass is very brittle the screen is decent as for durability and great for playback my review would be a 4 star except for the fact that once i downloaded the update that was ready to be installed out of the box (i waited a month before installing so i could see what all was impacted by it) i have noticed a slight decline in battery life and complete loss of the microphone in calls unless i have speakerphone on or an external headset i will update this post if and when a new update comes around to fix that problem.finally would i recommend this phone? yes i would as long as you keep a headset as part of your daily routine or chose to not install the updates.Updated rating up to 4 stars as the December update has fixed all problems with the microphone and no longer requireing a head set to use as a phone

"1173","Samsung Galaxy S8 2018 ReviewIntroduction The Samsung Galaxy S8. A device that has ushered in a new era of design in Samsung¡¯s mobile division. Now, Samsung¡¯s ¡°Best smartphone ever¡± is a year old. So, How does it hold up in 2018? I¡¯m going to preface this piece by saying that I haven¡¯t bought a flagship since 2015, with the release of the iPhone 6S in 16GB. Since 2015 smartphones have changed A LOT. Bezels in flagships have become a passe thing. And releasing a flagship with bezels in 2018 seems more of a taboo than a design flaw. Bezels in a 2018 flagship are considered unacceptable by most critics. And in some ways I can see why but we¡¯ll talk about that later. For now let¡¯s do a basic overview of this device. The Samsung Galaxy S8 was released in early 2017 with a QUALCOMM snapdragon 835 SOC, an Adreno 540 Graphics chip, 4 Gigabytes of RAM, and 64GB¡¯s of storage. Compared to other 2017 flagships, these specs aren¡¯t anything special, however one thing separates from the rest. The design of the phone. The curved back, and curved display with a marginally thin side lip, makes for a phone that molds into your hand. The glass front and back also makes the device very slippery in the hands. Which for me, isn¡¯t a good thing. While it¡¯s aesthetic is beautiful, I need a case on this thing to give me the grip I like. On the bottom of the device we see USB-C, a admittedly small bottom firing speaker, and surprise, a headphone jack. On the sides you¡¯ll find a power button as well as the volume rocker and bixby button. On the top you¡¯ll find a sim + micro sd card slot. And on the rear you¡¯ll find a fingerprint sensor on the right of the 13 megapixel camera lens, and flash + heartrate monitor. But let¡¯s go back to the headphone jack for a second. As I mentioned earlier my phone has been the iPhone 6S for about two years now, and headphone jacks for me are STILL a must have. My 3.5mm earpods work fine, so why replace them? I¡¯m glad the S8 kept the headphone jack, it¡¯s a breath of fresh air in a market where less is apparently more. And, in some respects the S8 nails what ¡°Less is more¡± means. With this philosophy being most prominent in the display.The Screen  The Screen of the Galaxy s8 is a beautiful Quad HD AMOLED panel with a unique 18:9 aspect ratio that takes up most of the front side of the phone, and this is a good thing. No longer do we see large bezels that do nothing for the device. In a way the display is not only more beautiful but also more utilitarian. The more screen real estate makes for a more satisfying experience in some apps, allowing one to be fully immersed in the content. While not every app is optimized for this screen ratio, a decent number of apps are, and the ones that aren¡¯t optimized are easy to make them look nice and fill the display. The panel itself has Vivid and bright colors that aren¡¯t as saturated as Samsung displays usually are, they are a little truer to life. The curved glass makes a return from the S7 Edge, a welcome inclusion to not only the design but the functionality. The edge tab, while not for everyone has made my experience with the device very interesting. It¡¯s customization is awesome allowing you to choose what information to show, so your never flipping through any useless panels. The edge lighting on the display is also helpful for notifications. The Viewing angles in the display are also very good. Colors are nice and smooth in a wide variety of viewing angles, and the very bright capability of the display also helps viewing angle quite a bit to mitigate reflection from lights and the sun, so no matter what angle your viewing the display from you¡¯ll almost always get a good clear picture from the phone. Overall, this phone has one of the best and brightest displays around, even today in 2018.  So, how does Samsung utilize these features in Software?The OS The Galaxy S8 originally shipped with android 7.0 Nougat with Samsung Experience 8.0, but now Android 8.0 Oreo is available for this device and with it brings Samsung Experience 9.0 to the table. We see a return of all the features from Nougat, with some little added features in Oreo, that without much investigation could go unnoticed. But, these features are very helpful to the user experience over stock android. The Launcher is intuitive and very customizable which is something I enjoy out of the box! The setup process is very easy to get through, it felt very iPhone like, which is a very good thing. The ability to change the button layout is also a very nice touch that allows the user to change it to their liking, this feature is not available on stock android, but it is present here which is all the much appreciated! The facial unlock, while not iPhone X level Is much more intuitive than it used to be, it is also for the most part pretty fast and accurate, the software also makes it very easy to register a face. Google Assistant and Samsung Bixby is baked right into android. Google assistant is my preferred assistant just because of my previous usage history. Bixby is the new-comer to the digital assistant game. While it¡¯s good, it¡¯s not great. Some things it doesn¡¯t understand yet, and overall to me it seems like a half-baked effort. But that¡¯s not to say it isn¡¯t getting better so my opinion might change as Samsung updates Bixby over time. Side note to Bixby, The Bixby button as mentioned in the overview is a button located under the volume rocker, it is mapped n default to launch Bixby by default, which is annoying. It can be remapped to launch something else using a third-party app, but other than that the button is quite useless in the software experience.  If you are switching from iPhone to Samsung, the software may be a learning curve but once you get the hang of it, it is quite nice, although Samsung¡¯s emoji are quite weird compared to the iPhone and some emojis don¡¯t show up at all or are completely different than the iPhone counterpart. If you are switching from another device or android phone, the interface might be a little heavy to say than what you¡¯re used to, so tread with caution if you love stock android. While the software brings many new features it also lacks consistent security patches. You will get a security patch every 2 <U+2013> 3 months, but it¡¯s not as consistent as I would like. Security is important to me, and I don¡¯t like the idea that I¡¯m not on the latest and greatest security patch, however if you can look over this, as it¡¯s quite nitpicky than you¡¯ll probably love the Samsung software on your phone.The Camera In 2018 smartphones have become the go-to camera for most casual smartphone users. We expect our cameras to take good pictures of us, our family, our children, our adventures in life. And to put it simply, the rear camera is AMAZING! It still does very well in 2018 against other flagships. It¡¯s quick auto mode allows amazing shots to be taken without any input from the user. The integrated pro mode also allows the inner photographer inside stretch its legs, with ISO and shutter speed controls just to name a few being present. There are other rear camera modes that will help in certain scenarios but often auto and pro mode will be plenty for taking pictures. The rear camera will give you shots that are Instagram worthy. The front facing camera is more mediocre. It takes OK, selfies and the automatic face enhancing features can sometimes make one¡¯s face look plastic. But once face filters have been turned off, in good lighting the front camera can produce some good selfies, not AW inspiring ones but, decent ones nether the less. Video recording is of course present, and the rear camera is optically stabilized so shooting smooth and stunning video is no problem. 4K recording is also here, but it can be shaky and isn¡¯t as sharp as I would like for 4K. The front camera also has video but It is not stabilized so video from this selfie cam can be shaky. Also please note, if you are a heavy snapchat user, this camera does not play nice with snapchat due to the lack of optimization from snap inc. So photos look noticeably worse than what the normal camera app would take, I would highly suggest sticking with the stock camera for most picture taking needs.The Tradeoffs This phone despite all of it¡¯s great highlight features has some flaw you want to consider. The fingerprint sensor can be hard to find due to it¡¯s close proximity to the camera. The Speaker isn¡¯t that loud and can easily be muffled by your hand depending on how you hold it. The phone also is very easy to drop, and Gorilla glass 5 while great, won¡¯t always save you from an accidental drop. So always have some sort of extra grip on the device to protect it. In stressful tasks it can also get hot and drain the battery, so try not to push it too hard all the time.Overall This phone in 2018 is an amazing device still. Consider it if the S9 or note 8 are too expensive. This is as close you¡¯ll get to a modern phone that is also fast and very sleek! Despite it being a year old, it¡¯s age isn¡¯t showing at all! I love it!Features not mentioned:IP 68 Water and dust resistanceWireless chargingIris scanningSamsung pay

            "
"1175","I bought my Galaxy S8 directly through the Verizon store, but I need to vent here on Amazon to warn others about he Galaxy S8 and even the new Galaxy S9's that are coming out very soon... Overall, the Galaxy S8 is a great flagship phone, it's fast, and offers amazing features. The biggest downfall, and why I'm likely to return it and grab a Pixel 2 phone, is a severe lack of good-quality aftermarket phone accessories that properly protect the phone. I'm used to going out and buying an Otterbox Defender, or a LifeProof for FULL phone and screen protection, and being happy about it. Unfortunately, if you look up the reviews for the Lifeproof or the Otterbox for the Galaxy S8, you will see just how much of a difficult time the aftermarket accessories providers have had with trying to FULL protect this Galaxy S8 phone because of its curved screen.Because of the curved screen on this phone, it is VERY hard to find ANYONE who makes a fantastic all-around screen protector or case for the Galaxy S8. Sure many people SELL cases and screen protectors for this S8 phone, but if you actually read most of the reviews on the aftermarket protective devices for the Galaxy S8, you'll see that the curved screen causes all kinds of issues such as killing the functionality of using the heart-rate sensor, or fingerprint reader, or the touch screen not working properly or as well as it should because of a curved screen protector goes on top of it. The curved screen on these Samsung phones, in my own humble opinion, is a terrible fad that needs to go away. It reminds me of when Samsung and others were also trying to push their hardest to sell curved LCD/LED TV's after the 3D-TV push to the American market failed due to impatient TV manufacturers waiting for 3D and curved screens to take-hold.When I bought my Galaxy S7 I purposely opted for the NON-curved screen because I was on the fence back then too. Now that Samsung has completely forced everyone into an ""all-or-none"" scenario where I can only buy a regular-sized curved screen, or a bigger-sized curved screen. After having tried this Galaxy S8 for a week now, buying the Otterbox and Spigen screen protector along with some tempered glass protectors that kept popping off because they only stay secured to the curved screen via a thin glue that is applied ONLY around the edges of the glass screen protector, and then trying the Lifeproof Fre case, and then trying the Ghostek waterproof case...I've just about lost my mind. The curved screen on this phone has NO good product that I can find where there is not a gap between the screen protector and the phones actual screen, making lots of texting and typing a major pain. The cases all seem to hinder functionality of fingerprint and heart-beat sensors and mess with the front AND back camera lighting a little, and they muffle speaker phone calls a bit... I could live with all the downsides EXCEPT for the touchscreen issues. If you cant touch the phone properly and make accurate presses, then the phone is useless and fails in its biggest goal as being a smart phone. Add insult to injury, every case I've tried still still leaves the curved area of the LCD screen unprotected (otherwise you wouldnt be able to use tabs or the curved screen functions)...but because these cases never properly protect the edge of the curved screen, it means that there is always a possibly of dropping your Galaxy S8 and it lands at such an angle where the edge of the curved screen hits first, and this will easily cause a broken or cracked screen. Look at the reviews for various Galaxy S8 cases and screen protectors on Amazon photos, and you'll see many broken-hearted people who thought their phone would be safe from a 4-foot drop onto the floor.These curved screens need to go away. Until I can get a FLAT-SCREENED phone with no dumb curves from Samsung (flat screens make it easier to get third-party accessory support for protective cases that actually work properly) then I'm done with Samsung after this recent headache. It's too bad too, because I've been a loyal Galaxy user since the Galaxy S2, and I've owned the S3, S4, S5, S6, AND S7 and was always very happy with the case and screen protector options that I could buy in the past. With this Galaxy S8, I'm almost certain it will end up broken with the S8 cases and screen protectors that are currently available on the market. Therefore, the Galaxy S8 goes back to the store and I'll have to buy a different Android phone. Samsung, please cater to all of your customers while keeping phone protection in mind. I'm sure that Samsung loves broken phones while selling replacements with all of the accidental warranty services out these days...but I dont want to buy a $700 to $1000 phone only to have crappy physical protection for it due to a silly curved screen. A curved screen isn't worth the potential losses and breakages to me.Seriously, what the heck.
            "
"1176","UPDATE 12/22/17: My phone is still going strong and looks pretty much the same as when I first got it. I'm still using the same Speck Candyshell Grip case and same liquid install screen protector. They are in great shape and providing enough protection tor my phone. The glitchy stuff seems to have mostly been fixed after an update. I have the unlocked version. Facebook app has been sucking big time, so I mostly access facebook through a browser and only use the facebook app to post pictures.When picking a phone over the past few months, I tried iphone 6s(hated the locked down feel and it had major battery drain with my music app that could not be fixed, so that was a deal breaker), Huawei Mate 9(Has a good camera, good battery life when battery drain isn't happening, but it isn't optimized for google apps and gets battery drain every couple weeks so I had to reset it all the time, ridiculous), LG G6(Great front camera, loved the wide-angle option, terrible front camera circa 2013 and bad connectivity with my Honda UPlay and Google play music)....And, now the Samsung S8, I have had it for a month now. It takes pretty good pictures. The Mate 9 had more detailed pics, but S8 takes better low-light photos in my experience. I'd say they are about tied for front cameras. The selfie camera is slightly better with the Mate 9 than the S8 because you can adjust more on the Mate 9 and the focus seems to be a little better when people stay in the background of a photo and not side by side. I prefer the Mate 9 photo gallery, too. It's easier to select photos to share. The speakers are a bit quiet and not as nice sounding on the S8 verses the Mate 9. Mate 9 has loud speakers with stereo option when it's side, but the S8 sounds acceptable and is much improved over my old Samsung S3. It's quieter than the LG G6 as well and comparable to the iPhone 6s. I heard the newer iPhones have stereo speakers and get pretty loud, though. But, new model iPhones are too expensive for me and offer less features than android phones at a similar price.So far, the Samsung S8 is still the better phone, it's more reliable, it does not have battery drain and the battery life is consistently allowing 6-7 hrs screen on time if all used in one day or around 5 hrs if used over 2 days. I do have to restart my phone sometimes because of minor glitches here and there. Not often, just a couple times a week, so no biggie. It does have a buggy connection with Google Play Music and Honda Uplay, but it still plays the music, it just causes the menu to flash on and off, but it's ignorable and better than not working like the G6, Mate 9 didn't have this problem, but the battery drain still makes Mate 9 a loser for me. I prefer the smaller feel of the S8. It feels very comfortable to hold as compared to the phablet phones like Mate 9. Samsung S8 has many accessories available to it that Mate 9 did not offer in the US due to lack of popularity. S8 has a car charger option, battery pack charger option, and many cases and screen protector options. I tried a couple cases and found the Speck Candyshell Grip case to be the best, I like that it gives some protection around the edge part of the screen while still leaving you full functionality and it's not bulky. I dropped my phone a couple times in the case from a couple feet up and the phone is unharmed.I used an IQ shield liquid install screen protector and that works well even though it takes longer to install. No issues with it coming loose until now. I don't like the curved phone screen, but the Samsung S8 is one of the best phones available and beats out the competition in my opinion. I got mine for close to $600 with tax, I don't think I would pay more than that. Watch for sales. It's been on sale many times since it's release. I would not recommend buying from Samsung directly. I bought one S8 from Samsung and returned it before going back and buying it again elsewhere. The return through Samsung took a month and I had to contact them a second time before they finally processed the return with some message about getting lost at the facility or something, but they still have a note about receiving it. Amazon is a good place to buy from as long as you buy directly through Amazon and not through a third party. It's nice that they give you a 30 day return period. That's the longest period I have seen anywhere.If you want an Android phone, Samsung is still the best available in the states, in my opinion. There are more nice phones available overseas, but you want to have a US warranty, easily available accessories, etc, that leaves you with Samsung, LG, Google, and iPhone for the most part. One big negative with Samsung is that screen is SUPER expensive to replace. I would not get a Samsung S8 if you are rough on your phones. There is an S8 active available through ATT and it's supposed to release for other carriers and maybe unlocked in the future from what I read. Maybe Amazon will get it, too?
            "
"1177","I bought my unlocked US version S8 from Best Buy about six months ago and it has progressively been randomly restarting more often and even with the US version, Samsung's customer service is atrocious.  It'll restart in the middle of phone calls, while I'm driving with Google Maps open, or while it's just sitting there with the lock screen on.I keep the phone up to date, the apps up to date, tried deleting all my apps, cleared the system cache, used safe mode for a few days, removed the SD card for a few days, and nothing has worked. It wasn't that big of an issue for the first 2 months, although I can't say how often it restarted because it does so randomly without notification (sometimes I'll pull it out of my pocket and it'll be rebooting), but I noticed it restarting about once a week.  Now, however, it's so unreliable that I make sure I know where I'm driving before I leave the house because odds are it'll reboot, no matter how short the drive is, and last night it restarted 3 times during a ten minute conversation with my boss. It's just a piece of junk.What's worse is Best Buy's warranty is only 14 days and Samsung's 1-year warranty has some serious strings attached that I'm sure they intended to make it a last-ditch-effort. After a long chat session with Samsung they gave me a packing slip that was only good for 2 days, I even had to procure my own box and packing material, and they told me the turnaround time would be about 3 weeks, primarily so they can cheapskate the domestic shipping.  Then, they'll either fix the phone or send me a refurbished one that hopefully had its kinks worked out (otherwise rinse, repeat), and that's only if they determine the phone is a factory defect. If they determine I was somehow responsible then I'd have to pay the full price for repairs and shipping, and where they draw the line at acceptable wear and tear is anyone's guess, but presumably it's not going to be biased in my favor, especially based on how they've conducted themselves so far. Super convenient, right? So those of you upset about not having a Samsung warranty, trust me, you're not missing much.The best solution I've found is that some Best Buy stores are Samsung Authorized Service Providers, so they can do the repairs in-house. The bad news is that these repair centers are only in like 10 states and most aren't in major cities, however, there's a huge concentration of stores in the Dallas area. Luckily I'm an airline pilot and I can fly for free, so I'm going to fly halfway across the country next week to get my phone fixed, but I realize that's not an option for most people. Hopefully the trip will be worth it. I can understand Samsung having such bad customer service if the phone was dropped, the screen was cracked, etc, but for factory issues that don't become apparent right away, you'd think it'd be better than trying to get a refund on a Hotwire hotel. especially for a company that sells so many electronics.  I mean, electronics are sensitive and the best break before they get to the consumer, but if their business model is to make it so frustrating to get them to stand by their warranty that you just go out and buy someone else's product, no wonder their stock tanked this year.  I, for one, am staying away from Samsung until they have a change in corporate culture.
            "
"1178","So many other reviewers have posted exemplary write-ups detailing the features, benefits, photos of the S8.  I won't even try to compare. All I can tell you is that I needed to replace my 3-year-old Galaxy Alpha, so when the Galaxy S8 went on sale over Labor Day weekend, I walked into a big box retailer (whose name rhymes with ""guest guy"") intending to buy one of the lesser priced prior year models like the G7. However when I walked into the display area, the S8 winked at me, it was love at first sight, I was stunned and floored by the beauty, grace, forward-looking design, advanced features including VR, and vibration control video camera performance that reminded me (in my simplistic estimation) of Hollywood steadicam, a far cry from my prior Alpha's performance in that regard.  (Plus, simply, when it comes to Android, where obsolescence unfortunately happens rather quickly, newer is better, because it gives you longer usable life.)  I bought.  I haven't looked back.  The two of us have been joined at the hip (literally) for almost 2 months, as I mated it with a very inexpensive, minimal size holster case that visually recedes out of the way to allow the stunning beauty of this phone to shine (while continuing to buffer it from shocks).Phone setup was a breeze, as I merely unplugged the micro SIM from my Galaxy Alpha, plugged it into the S8, and my cellular carrier was auto-configured by the S8, so you really can't hope for anything cleaner than that. Plus the simplified migration utility that came with the S8  copied over my files and photos, my contacts lists and more, from my prior phone.I spent a fair amount of time optimizing app power use.  The S8 now uses minimal power while I'm out and about, and at night it takes no more than a few minutes to bring to full charge again, ready for next day.A chief buying criteria for me was camera performance. I found amazing praise in the comparative reviews published at GSMArena, a prominent factor in my willingness to purchase the S8.  Camera performance matches or exceeds reviewers' expectations.Unlock methods:  fingerprint / face scan / iris scan / voice scan / nearby device detection / draw pattern / type a PIN.  (I've used face, fingerprint, pattern.)  Fingerprint wasn't working for a while but Samsung fixed with a firmware push (Nov 2018).I'm a guy who has consciously avoided the phablet phenomenon as I can't imagine carrying a massive hunk of hardware wherever I go. The S8 has surprised me with its incredibly large viewable area, while still maintaining a manageably slim and narrow carrying profile, the perfect fusion of function, beauty and utility, in my opinion.Read some of the other reviews, see it for yourself, and allow yourself to believe that there truly can be such an exceptional piece of engineering.So far, it's been a joy ride.
            "
"1179","Honest review: (CONS FIRST)1. Not durable and hard to protect screen.If you are active and work out etc. and tend to drop your phone every once in awhile this phone is not for you. I dropped from 2 feet or so and the glass shattered because it landed face down. If you don't believe me look at what reviews say online. Furthermore, the glass scratches very easy. Like if you have a tiny metal button on your Jean's by your  pocket or sometimes drop your keys in with your phone. The second part of this is that I tried purchasing a screen protector but the cheap film ones just don't work, you need an expensive glass one that has a special adhesive which may cost an extra 50-100 dollars and ruins the sensitivity and beauty of the screen.2. The phone can be annoyingly complexNote: This is just my preference. I enjoy simplicity and ease of use because I'm a rather busy person and I just want things to work. I got rather annoyed when I went to volume down and there were 6 volume bars for media, ringtone, system, Bixby, etc. and the phones recognition when changing apps is not smooth. Example: I volume down in app and media volume goes down, then I close app and volume down, it will still volume down media for a couple seconds, and because there is no silence bar it takes longer to silence your phone.Second,There are other annoying things like getting back in to end a call if your looking at other things while talking etc. Just use the phone in a store before you buy it.Also, I couldn't tell you how difficult it was to purchase things in the Google play store, it took me a long time. I wished it synced with samsung pay.3. The edge of the screen is constantly beingaccidentally activated by the palm of my hand. I eventually turned it off.4. I just feel there is less security with apps. When I download them they literally always want access to everything!I have always owned apple phones but I decided to switch after reading tons of good reviews about this phone on consumer reports. Apple's latest scandal of slowing down old phones upset me as well.PROS:1. The screen is amazing. I just went back to iphone 8 and I still look back at my S8 screen thinking how much better it is.2. The camera is great.3. Amazing battery life.4. Everything in terms of hardware seems tip top.At the end of the day a cracked screen is 200 plus to replace as of 4/18. While the hard hardware is great, it's just to fragile and impracticable for the everyday user. If you get this phone please get a good case that protects the front. Hope this helps!
            "
"1180","2 things about this phone really frustrates me.  Since the moment I got it out of the box, no matter how many setting I adjusted, the displays blacks out after 10 seconds.  Plus each time I remove the pictures to a safe place to save memory, these pictures return to the phone.  Now I understand there are software features at play, but I should be turning these on.  This should not be occurring out of the box.  Now I got a ton of duplicates stored on my computer harddrive and pics that won't delete on my phone.  The other issue I hate is the screen is not protected well by every case I have looked at.  I'm told it's a curved screen feature, but why would I want this feature!  The screen won't scratch if I set down upside down on a table but if it falls on a rock, it's over.  I really hate this.
            "
"1181","For context, in the past three years, I have used a Samsung Galaxy S5 and an LG G5 for my personal line, and an iphone 5s for my work line.  I have been using the S8 for a little while now and it's a mix of upgrades and downgrades from my previous phones.  Before I go into my review, I would like to point out that this review is for the second S8 phone that I got.  The first one (which I ordered from samsung.com) arrived defective, where a dime-sized portion of the touch screen was completely unresponsive out of the box.  While I'm sure every phone manufacturer will ship some defective devices, this has definitely lowered my confidence in Samsung's quality control.  Also, the Samsung customer support is the worst I've ever dealt with, and I spent 9 phone calls and over 13 hours trying to get the issue resolved.  If you do buy the device, buy from a third party (amazon, best buy, verizon, - just not samsung's online store) Here is my review of my second (non-defective) s8 device:1. The screen - First the good: It gets relatively bright outdoors, and is a high quality screen.  Now the bad:  The curve of the screen is the worst feature of the phone.  Sure, it makes the phone look fancy, but it actually makes the phone functionally worse.  When watching full screen videos, you will always have a  distracting glare on the curved edges of the screen.  This effectively means that every movie you watch in landscape mode will have the top and bottom of the movie distorted and annoying to watch.  Second, I have occasionally accidentally activated the back button with my hand when reaching over to the far edge of the screen, and this is definitely because the curve of the screen allows this.  The curve also makes it more difficult to get a glass screen protector that will make full contact with the screen.  And when you do find one, you'll still end up with a non-contact spot if you dont install it precisely in the right spot.  (I wasted a screen protector trying to find the right position.)2 - Performance - The performance of the phone is pretty great.  I haven't had any hiccups and everything seems to be running smoothly.3 - Battery Life - So far the battery is better than any of the phones I have previously had.  It gets me through the day with roughly 45% left at the end of the day.  That's from 7:30am to around 11pm.  I'd estimate I probably use around 4 to 5 hours of screen-on time during a full day.  I really dont like that the battery is not user-replaceable, but that's the world we live in now.  Based on how batteries degrade over time,  I suspect that a year from now, the battery life will not be as good as it is now, and I will have no way to replace it on my own.4 - Cameras - The front and back cameras work well.  I do miss the dual back camera that my LG G5 had, because once in a while a wide angle shot would have been useful.  If you have never used a dual back camera before, you obviously wont miss it.  But if you have, you might be in the same boat wishing that samsung had included it.5 - Fingerprint scanner - The offset location of the fingerprint scanner is odd.  If you use the phone without a case on it, this will probably annoy you as locating it by feel is not super easy.  I always have a case on it though, and this solves the problem.  With the case on it, my finger is immediately  able to find the edge of the cutout in the case, landing it directly on the scanner.  As long as your finger lands on it, the fingerprint scanner is actually quite responsive.6. Bixby - I have only used the voice assistant bixby a few times, so these are only my initial impressions.  I have used Bixby pretty successfully using voice commands to have it read and send text messages without me having to look at or touch the phone.  This is better than my experience with google now.  The bixby button is annoyingly easy to accidentally press though.  It hasn't been a consistent issue for me yet, but if my fingers dont learn to avoid it, I may start looking to see if there are any workarounds to remap or disable the button.7 - Build and design quality - This is where all of the professional review sites have gotten it wrong.  Most of the review sites praise this phone for ""feeling premium"" and having a great design. I'm sorry to say but they clearly have no understanding of what premium build quality is.  If they mean it feels like solid glass, yeah it does, because it is.  Both the front and back are glass.  Sure my fingers feel the glass too, but solid and smooth doesn't mean premium.  What my brain knows when it's holding glass is that it's holding something fragile.  I'm an engineer, and this is how I would design a phone if I wanted it to shatter in a drop.  The curved screen makes it worse, as it's significantly more likely that an impact will occur against the glass.  Also, because of the curve, there are no phone cases that will wrap around the sides of the phone.  This means even with a case there is a good chance you will damage your phone if you drop it.  If you buy this phone, you should probably also get a accidental damage warranty, and expect to pay something like a $100 deductible on top of that if/when you drop the phone.  I hope this design fad goes away, because I would much prefer a phone with a flat screen and an aluminum or plastic back.8 - Water Resistance - The phone is supposed to be water resistant, but honestly I didn't have the guts to check, so I'll have to take their word for it.Overall - This is a mix of good and bad features.  The problem is, there aren't that many device options for a Verizon user who prefers android.  I would have gone with the LG G6, but after the build quality and GPS issues that I (and many other people, apparently) experienced with the G5, I dont really want to buy another LG phone.  The Moto Z2 series looks good, and I'd love to have a phone I don't have to be concerned about dropping, but the phone is bigger than I'd like.  The S8 is a nice size.  Given the other options out there, I don't regret my s8 purchase, but I don't love the phone, and I'm not confident that I wouldn't have been happier with the Moto Z2 or G6.

"1184","This is an amazing phone. I bought it outright and had it unlocked immediately on a CDMA plan. Took a trip and my carrier wasn't anywhere in the area. Found a local store that said only one was. He sold me a pay as you go SIM, which allowed me to do texting, but I blocked all the rest, and it worked perfectly. Just as promised by Samsung, it is broadcast band independent!
            "
"1185","I can not say enough about this phone. It is as perfect as a company has done creating the perfect smartphone for me.This phone is PERFECT in my hand. Its screen is big but you wouldn't be able to tell because it is in such a small footprint. The phone is light. The worst thing about the design is how slippery it is. But a skin or case will fix that.The bezelless display makes it look leagues above every phone out there other then the Pixel 2, Essential Phone, iPhone X and LG V30. To me however the iPhone X and the S8 are tied aesthetically. They both represent the next generations of what is a smartphone. I almost bought a LG G6 before I even held this phone and thank god I didn't buy it. It doesn't compare aesthetically at all. I can list many reasons why this phone is better then all phones other then the Note 8. The V30 is debatable. And the iPhone X isn't available to the masses yet.The screen is AMAZING. Which everyone knows Sammy Mobile creates the best screens around. However, I came from a Note 5 to this thing and could instantly see the difference. Which is crazy because I didn't think the screen could get any better at a QHD resolution (this screen is only QHD+ because of the 16:9 aspect ratio).At first I thought I would hate the aspect ratio. I love squarish phones so much and prefer my displays to be more square then rectangle. But I actually got used to it fast. Content on this looks so good with that aspect ratio. Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Video and the native Samsung video app all support a zoom in function. At first I was thinking this would be terrible because it would look stretched and things would be missing I needed to see. But no. They did an AMAZING job with the zoom feature. It's the reason I was finally sold on this aspect ratio. With out it I would have never gotten this phone.The cameras are amazing. The pixel is the only one that compares. Even the iPhone X looks night and day compared to this phone. It may be preference but shots from this phone are so much better imo.I waited a month before I wrote this review to see if the phone would start slowing down or stuttering. Nope! I run a launcher and a custom notification shader and my phone doesn't even seemed bothered. My Note 5 slowed down and sputtered when I customized the heck out of it. My S8+? No problem.The fingerprint scanner, iris scanner and facial recognition are all amazing. I have used them all and had no problems. Yes photos can trick facial recognition. However I am way more worried about a stranger robbing me or stealing it then I am of someone I know taking it. So facial recognition to me, has gotten a bad rep on this phone. As well as the fingerprint scanner. I pull out my phone conveniently with my finger in the same spot as the fingerprint scanner. So to me this design works. When I am using it two handed I just slide my left hand up and it really isn't that bad. But it is the biggest complaint on this phone. That says A LOT!Battery life has been phenomenal. I crank it to max brightness. Wifi is usually on, NFC and bluetooth. I am still averaging like 4-5 1/2 screen on time.With a bezelless gorgeous 2K HDR screen, 4 gb Ram, Samsung Pay, the cameras, the security features (Samsung Knox, Pass, Secure Folder and the various biometric locks ), the light skin over Android, the specs that future proof it (LTE-A/LTE+, Bluetooth 5.0), big battery with great longevity (battery cycle count a lot higher then all phones before it) and wireless charging, HEADPHONE Jack, exedra exedra this is as perfect as a cell phone as you can get imo. Front facing stereo speakers are the only missing feature I can think of. But even then the speaker on this is really nice.As you can tell I love this phone. Probably my favorite peice of tech since I got my iPad Pro 9.7. Definitely by this. If you don't get a V30, Note 8 or iPhone X instead if that's your thing.Easiest 5/5 rating I have ever given.

"1186","4/19/2018 Important update:  I finally found a hands free app that works, its called ""Call To Bluetooth"".  So now I can make phone calls and launch music hands free.  I still don't know why this isn't standard on every phone.03/29/2018 Had it for 5 weeks.  Went from a Motorola to this because my company no longer provides Motorolas.  I use it for work, and forgive me sounding ageist, but I'm not of the generation who spends their lives staring at their phones.  I use a bluetooth head set so that I can listen in noisy environments like construct sites and mechanical rooms, that works well, but you can forget about hands free operation.  Everything I've tried requires that I withdraw the phone from its belt clip, unlock it, then use the voice commands, totally defeating the purpose of hands free.  So if I'm driving I have to handle the phone.  Not safe.  My Motorola also had a motion activated camera, so if I""m standing on a ladder all I had to do was draw the phone, twist it and the camera came on. Now I have to unlock it first, again more attention to the phone, not as safe.  I've tried 3 different hands free apps and none of them have overcome this.  I did find a 'shake on' flashlight app that works so when I""m doing above ceiling inspections I don't have to look at the phone for that. When I read reviews on this before getting it all they want to talk about is the curved screen. Really?  No one over the age of twelve should be captivated by this trinket.  I did find out how to turn off the edge touch so I quit invoking bixby every time I handled the thing.  And that's another thing, Bixby is just a powerful marketing tool for Samsung.  It tracks everything you do and targets ads to you.  I have been a loyal Samsung fan for years, still have a Samsung flat screen and DVD that are going on 10 years old and work as well as they did on day one, so I'm guessing the mechanics of the phone will be great, but these features make the S8 less useful for me. Bixby is an insult and I don't care if every other phone in world does something similar its still an affront.ps: This Amazon account is in my wife's name in case anybody cares.

"1187","This phone is absolutely beautiful to hold and it has a sleek, 'new-car' feeling!Over all the functionality is similarly comparable across the Galaxy phones (4/7edge) with exception to few obvious changes (upgrades?) to the phone.  In the quest for the slick, they opted to take away the 'Home' button, which my fingers - as well as other iPhone/Galaxy users - have gotten subconsciously programmed to press, only to find that there are no buttons. I would need to 'swipe up' from the bottom of the screen and a virtual 'Home¡¯ button, 'back' function and 'multi-window' interface becomes accessible.This phone has a Samsung Note8-esque interface (not to mention, the screen size difference between those two is just 0.1 inch!). So outside of the Stylus, S8+ promises to be just as versatile in its use!  One other function they did away with - because of the ¡®Home¡¯ button change - I have to use the Volume down+Power button to take a screenshot.  Using my thumb+middle finger to squeeze a shot may get some getting used to!The 3500mAh Battery holds well through the day (I use it heavily and I only seem to be down to about 35% by dinner time) and the only thing that seems to 'overheat' the product and/or shorten the battery life is when I am using it with VR.When I first had the Samsung S4, I was able to capture image of a beautiful low-light sunset (for which I was selected winner for a photography submission) and ever since then I¡¯ve been HOOKED!  I took a photo of another sunset! This one was taken without any special filter and yet it beautifully captures the layers of the fading colors - S8+ exceeds it¡¯s low-light capabilities of it's predecessors!  In addition, there are some new photo functions (swipe left in ¡®Camera¡¯). I love that as an inner (or Yelp) ¡®Foodies¡¯, I have my very own food filter to snap as many lunch or dinners as I pleased!  Use the 'Pro' function and I am Wow'd with the filter package it comes with!Getting an unlocked phone will give me the freedom to choose mobile network not just in the US but Internationally - which is great, as an international photographer to travel with and it sure beats carrying around multi handsets!  As an unlocked phone, this Samsung S8+ has both CDMA and GSM capabilities.  I went with a CDMA network, and the company blocked my ¡®Talk and Surf¡¯ function. On the bright side, CDMA does seem to preserve the battery life better so it¡¯s a toss up!As the saying goes, ya either will Love it or Hate it, like Kimchee.  Take it from a diehard Macgirl that switched out of the iPhone to a Samsung.  It was worth it and haven¡¯t gone back!  <U+2028>

"1188","Far too fragile for everyday use. I dropped this from 2-3 feet up (hand at my side), with a case, and the curved glass corner cracked. Samsung of course makes a fortune selling replacement screens, though I'm going to buy another brand phone instead. Durability should be much, much higher at this price point for a device that's taken with you wherever you go. Independent tests confirm poor durability here.
            "
"1189","The phone has too many gimmicks. The curved edges do nothing but make the phone more difficult to use. For example, when larger hands hold the phone they usually have a bit of skin on the curved edge effectively rendering the screen unable to select anything.Also, the software buttons can be frustrating.Overall, this is the best phone I've had but the features designed to make the phone look cool actually make it worse.

"1191","I had iphone 6+ and changed to the S8. I did not like the over size and weight iphone 6+ and I did not like the small screen size of the iphone 6. The S8 is much smaller and lighter and has a bigger screen which is amazing. The display is way better than iphone 6+ and also is OLED which iphone doesn¡¯t have and maybe the next gen iphone will have on its most expensive model. Pictures and movies look far superior than on the iphone. I needed and unlocked phone so when I travel to other countries I just drop in a sim card from that country and not have to pay roaming charges etc.The S8 supports wireless charging in which I bought an after market wireless charger stand for $16 and works excellent and also can charge while on its side which is nice when watching movies. The screen looks like miniature movie theatre when watching full length movies and most movies fill the entire screen.The memory can expand to 2 TB when available but I just stuck in 128 gig sd card for now. I have lots of FLAC lossless music and it takes up lots of space and also have lots of HD movies. By the way Apple does not support FLAC lossless music which is the most prolific lossless music format available. And also the S8 video is 4k so that takes a lot of memory. You need to up the resolution in settings as the default is not the highest.The benchmarks show that the S8 is twice as fast as the iphone 6+. The battery life seems good but did not have it long enough. Some people say that the battery life is average but with the much higher speed and higher resolution graphics, the tradeoff of slightly less battery life is fine with me. Also the weight factor and size is important to me.It has a built in pulse sensor and O2 sensor which works good and can calculate stress level also.When plugged into my Dell I7 notebook it sees the internal memory and the SD card so easy to load files from the computer. However when plugged into my Acer Aspire I5 desk computer it sees the S8 but not the internal or external memory. Also when using my wifi file transfer app it only can access the internal memory and does not see the external memory.The fingerprint sensor works excellent and after a few times I had no problem putting my finger on the sensor and not accidently on the camera lens. I don¡¯t know why people complain as it is a no brainer after a few times only. I find the fingerprint sensor to be very fast and 100% accurate. However I use the retina sensor to unlock the phone and works excellent also and very fast and 100% accurate so I don¡¯t use the fingerprint sensor unless I have to.I do not know how the new iphone 8 will compare of course but with the new iphone OS 11 you won¡¯t be able to run any 32 bit programs so many programs will not work after the upgrade. The S8 also retains the headphone jack which is important to me and apple got rid of it of course forcing you to use and adapter. The S8 uses the  C type usb connector which is much better and more robust than the micro usb that most phones come with and now appears to be the industry standard for portable devices.The phone is also waterproof to a certain extent but I did not test it and not sure how water will not get into the headphone jack. The earphones that come with the phone are throw away type but maybe ok for phone call and with good earphone and or headphone the sound is excellent with FLAC lossless music.I like the fact that I can open multiple windows and switch back and forth quickly which Apple OS can¡¯t do and also there is always a back button which somehow Apple feels is not necessary so going back to a previous page etc. is impossible unless the app itself contains a back button. It is also easier to add items in groups than the Apple OS. Lots of other features makes this phone easier to use and manage than the Apple OS.As soon as you get this phone you need to buy a case and a good screen protector obviously due to the front and back being glass. The case would make the size a little bigger but not as big and cumbersome as the 6+.I have not used the Bixby and the left Bixby button should be user programmable so the user has control as to what you want it to do. There are other options to use other than Bixby of course.To conclude, there is no perfect phone but this has the fewest problems of the phones I¡¯ve encountered up until now and I bought this on sale making the price much cheaper than the comparable iphone also.

"1192","Definitely a noticeable improvement in speed from the S7; it seems snappier. Losing the physical home key and moving the fingerprint sensor to the back near the camera lens was a little annoying at first, but I got used to it fairly quickly. Even though the physical home key is gone, there is still a satisfying tactile ""click"" for feedback if you press down on the location of the home key. You also can lightly touch the home key and it will respond, like the back and menu keys.The size is nice. The screen is narrow enough that I can reach across the entire screen with my smaller hands, and it is tall/long enough to allow more of a webpage to be read on the screen at one time.Bixby seems like another S voice knockoff that doesn't quite do things as well as Google Voice. There are some youtube videos showing cool tricks you can do with Bixby that can't be done with the other voice apps, but they seem like tricks rather than useful tools. I ended up disabling Bixby, and there are some low-cost apps available to help you do that. The placement of the Bixby button so close to the volume buttons actually ends up with a lot of accidental Bixby pop-ups when you are trying to adjust the volume.The camera is awesome. It starts up quickly and the autofocus is fast. There is plenty of on-board memory for photos and video. One somewhat hidden feature in the Edge is the Animation portion of the Smart Select. You can select an area of the screen while a video is playing and create a GIF. Perfect for making a reaction GIF.

"1193","Pretty good looking and impressive phone. I definitely like it much better than the iPhone 6 that I had. I've had it for 2 1/2 months and so far so good. But Samsung is notorious for their phones doing good for the first 6 months and then crapping out because of their software updates. We'll see. I did go for the Sprint 12 month Forever Galaxy Plan so I don't have to wait every two years to upgrade.The interface is much more intuitive than the iPhone 6. Gorgeous 5.8"" edge to edge Infinity screen. I like how you can crop the screen on YouTube videos. They do need to patch the software to allow users to keep that feature on at all times. Annoying not having that option. Great speakerphone. Loud and clear!Overall, probably the best smartphone on the market right now. As of this post, Apple just announced their new iPhone X. I remember when Samsung was playing catch-up with Apple, now it's the opposite. The iPhone X seems like a copy of the GS8. Front and back glass. 5.8"" curved screen. Probably the same 18.5 by 9.0 ratio screen as well. I don't think most people care for those fat and wide phones, I know I don't. The GS8 is narrow and comfortable in your hand, still sporting a huge screen size for a smartphone.I was watching Fox News when the iPhone X was announced and these people, who by the way all seem to be on the Apple bandwagon, were cheerfully saying and bragging about the X's face recognition, like this was some new technology. The GS8 already has that going back to the Note 7, as well as having iris scanning which the X doesn't have.Did anyone see that jerk CEO Tim Cook brag about the X's feature of their interactive emoticons, using a pile of crap with a funny face? What class! Apple can keep their NSA iPhone X! I know I know, we have the same problem with Google Android phones as well. Oh well, what can we do? I need my smartphone for work. :-(

"1194","Excellent hardware but the Samsung software could have been written better by a sophomore computer science major.The Samsung Bloatware should be uninstallable by the end user. This is my first Samsung phone and probably my last. I bought two because after being an Android purist with Nexus and HTC devices, I figured I would give them a try. I am really disappointed with the Galaxy Software and store. I love Google photos but the camera app keeps forcing the Samsung app on me. I gave it a two star for the software and lack of ability to uninstall most of it. You can disable some apps but they are usually back at reboot. Even with all of my Google app store credits from survey rewards, this will probably push me over the edge to go to iPhone. Samsung, please get your crap together and fix this software abomination.

"1195","These manufacturers are charging way too much money for cell phones these days. A man is supposed to spend 3 months salary on an Engagement ring to ask his lady to marry him, not 3 months salary on a phone.Joking aside I've been an android user since the beginning of the smart phone era. Before this S8 I had an S5 and it was a very nice transition.This phone works and works well. I love that it's water proof and when it gets dirty I  just hold it on under running water and scrub if with hand soap. The naked phone is a bit slippery so I highly recommend the otter box defender case.I bought this phone on sale during Prime Day which gave a nice $200 discount plus they threw in a few free toys. The package included the wireless charging pad which I use everyday but would never pay extra for. It's really not necessary. And it came with the VR goggles which I still haven't taken out of the box. I know the goggles need the naked phone and I keep my phone in the otter box case so I'll never use the goggles. If it was an option I honestly would have preferred a heavier discount on the phone and they could have kept the wireless pad and goggles.

"1196","I have not seen a smart phone camera yet that compares to the s8 main camera. It is without a doubt the best camera in a smart phone i've ever seen to date. The pics it can take are amazing and just as good as my $5000 camera i use for professional photography. It blows away apple in my opinion, Yes apple has some decent phones but ISO is not quite a computer if you ask me they can't be plugged into any PC without having to download itunes which comes with malware that you don't know your installing on your PC and can damage some pc's.It also installs some other apps you don't know your getting that can cause serious issues with system settings in the PC if its not an apple.Any android can be plugged into any PC without a problem with no software to clog up your PC. The processor is killer,4 gig of ram! And I was sold on the camera immediately.  Being in a dark room or outside at night the pictures are crystal clear and can be adjusted with the pro setting it can take some time to figure out if you are not a photographer but still very user friendly.The battery is OK but if you don't have a app killer constantly killing background apps it will drain your battery pretty quick. But this can be controlled, Power battery is my most recommended app killer that keeps apps closed and keeps tabson the battery. It really does not need any cleaner apps since one is built in. I can't wait for the s9 to come out they are both going to be around the same price? the s8 and s9 at least for a while. I give the s8 5 stars!!!

"1197","Exactly what was advertised. I was a little worried when reading other reviews as it seems some have received used, refurbished, or even fake devices.  I made the purchase despite these worries and couldn't be happier. The phone is great, it was a good price, and it was delivered sooner than the original estimated delivery date. I would be careful with who you actually order from if buying from a 3rd party seller but my experience was great!

You need to make an insurance claim to replace ENTIRE PHONE. and pay the price. Even with insurance it is not cheap.

"1204","As the new year approached, one of my goals was to try something different. I though, what better way to start off the new year than switch over to the Samsung Galaxy S8? As a Apple IOS user for over 10 years, I found the switch difficult and challenging, however, almost 2 weeks into using the Galaxy S8, I don't want to go back! I am very happy with the decision I've made to try out this device.<U+00A0>What I really liked about the Galaxy S8:-Customizable: There is so much more customization I can do with the Galaxy S8 where I couldn't or was limited to do with other phones.-The Infinity Display: When configured correctly, the S8 has a phenomenal colorful infinity display.<U+00A0>-Headphone Jack: As competitor brands are shift away from the headphone jack, I'm grateful Samsung decided to leave the headphone jack in the S8. The headphone jack becomes useful when I accidentally forget to charge my wireless headphones.-Iris Scan: I enjoy the Iris scan as it is more accurate and reliable than the face recognition. No matter how many times I set up the face recognition, the device couldn't recognize my face. The iris scanner is more reliable with a faster response time.-Finger Print Scanner: Though many Samsung users argue the finger print scanner is placed awkwardly in the back, I, a person w/ long fingers, enjoy it as I can easily reach the fingerprint scanner with one hand.-Camera- When configured to the highest resolution i, in my opinion, the photos and videos on the S8 look phenomenal.<U+00A0>-Fast Charging- The S8 charges extremely fast! I purchased a wireless charger that also allows me to charge the S8!Google Assistant- Real MVP- I use it everyday!Cons:Unfortunately, since the Galaxy S8's aspect ratio, l experience black bars around the screen. Though there is a option to fit the movie/video in the whole screen, it reduces the quality of the video.The speaker on the galaxy S8 is very low compared to other devices. It's difficult watching a video or clip out in public.<U+00A0>Recommendations:Purchase a screen protector to protect this beautiful 5.8 inch AMOLED Infinity Display Screen!Purchase a case! Due to the phones glossy glass exterior, it's likely to get slippery and covered with finger prints. I use the OtterBox Commuter Series that I purchased through Amazon!<U+00A0>Customize your phone to your personality!

"1205","Normally I would have given 5 stars because the phone works very well.Samsung did an extremely LOUSY JOB with the fingerprint scanner. The fingerprint scanner is totally unusable for someone with somewhat larger hands. And I am not a big guy. Imagine a Caucasian man who does manual work. It will never work. The fingerprint scanner is made for children or women with very little hands.The face recognition is also unreliable. Much less so, but still unreliable.So, Samsung, someone did a very bad job here.....

"1206","Amazing phone. I bought mine from Costco, but I have not had any issues with my Galaxy. The 64 GB of storage is more than enough for my apps, photos and music. The battery life is exceptional and the fast charging adapter that comes with all Galaxy phones is amazing for quickly getting some juice while you are in a rush. Wireless charging is amazing in that I only need to set my phone down and it will begin charging. I switched from the iPhone 7 Plus and I do not see myself going back to Apple anytime soon.

"1207","Let me start by saying that i owned almost all the Samsung Galaxy phones starting from s2, and i am a big Samsung fan. However the recent crop of Galaxy phones is left to be desired when it comes to the form factor and the screen. The biggest issue is with the AMOLED screen, which is oversaturated and suffers from back light shimmer especially around text. It suffers from poor white balance and contrast, as well as from Blu light bleeding around the curved edges. The font is noticably less sharp than on Apple's retina displays, and whites are almost gray... Very bad rendition of AMOLED technology, IMHO...Second biggest problem with the latest Galaxy lineup is the  elongated form factor which is very hard to use with one hand, as well as view content in landscape mode. Not all applications support the ultra wide screen format, and the contents looks odd in a very short but wide viewing area...Also not insignificant the fact that the phone is literally very slick, and can easily slip out ones hands. The galaxy back cover of the case feels fragile, and the phone simply requires a case to have any semblance of durability. It is literally superslick and fragile... Huge design problem...and this is not to mention that especially in black it is a fingerprint magnet...It is a shame, sine the phone is really a good performer and has a good battery life...  and I really love Samsung's latest rendition of it's TouchWiz Android experience...I bought this phone unlocked from BestBuy thinking I would fall in love with it, but unfortunately I had to return it on the third day at a penalty. I do not recommend this phone, especially at its current high price point...

"1208","This phone is amazing but has one massive flaw. The edge to edge screen, while it looks and performs amazingly is the downfall of this device. You will break this phone.You could put a case on it to protect the glass edges. However, the case will only be effective if it is also covering the edges of the screen that your phone will fall on when you drop it. So if the only way to realistically use this phone without having to replace it every time you drop it is to cover the main feature, the edge to edge screen with a case. So what is the point of the phone? Save your heartache with cracked screans and invest in any of the competitors that won't shatter on the first drop.

"1209","This phone lives up to my expectations. One nice thing Samsung did was include multiple USB cable type adapters to make the transition to USB C less painful for those who have micro USB cables. Setup was easy, and with a T Mobile SIM from my less than flattering G6, booted right up and started working with the network. Build quality seems to be good.Bixby is interesting, and works about as well as Google's voice activation, if not slightly better, it at least tells you when it can't do something, and has a nice tutorial when you first swipe to its screen on the phone.

"1210","Out of all the smart phones Ive used in my life Samsung has always made the best impression. The apple ecosystem has always been strong competition however the battery life on the iPhone was always ridiculous which makes no sense because their macbook pro batteries are incredible. Also since the macbook pro and the samsung S8 both use usb -c, in my opinion they make a better combination. Lets face it, everyone has a macbook pro. The Pixel 2XL seems to be the only real competitor for the S8 but the bezel is way too thick compared to the S8's invisible edge. The only real downside to this phone is the placement of the fingerprint scanner but you can always config facial or retina recognition. Alternatively, you can try out the S9 which is basically the same phone but the fingerprint scanner is reachable by your double jointed swan neck deformed stubbs. Visit planet-red.net to see pictures i took of my dog on the S8 camera. The quality is THICCC. 10 out of 10, would recommend this baddie.

So I can set it on the edge of the tub and not have to worry if I may accidentally knock it into the water. It does have a limit though. Read the manual. It is very user friendly just as all Samsung Galaxies are. I know there is so much more I could tell you but just know it is a great phone overall.

It's small footprint  is an illusion since the screen cracks easily so you must protect it with an Otter Box or some other armored case.  It's hard to determine what's good about the phone since the carrier has a say in what comes with it.  The best part is the camera, just great.  At times I want to return to my old Motorola (Lenovo) Plus 4, big screen and battery life.

"1215","It's easily my best phone so far. The screen is really nice. The form factor is a great surprise. It's very easy to hold.The phone also has a great camera that is better than on any previous phone, a Nexus 5X.My biggest concern with Samsung phones was it's software, especially after coming from a pure Google phone. I have been pleasantly surprised how nice Samsungs have gotten. In many ways it is nicer to use than a pure Google phone.The battery life is great and so is the speed and the usability. In all its a great phone.

"1216","This is my very first Smartphone and I love it so far.  Just for calling, texting, checking emails and taking photos, it's terrific, but that's all I have sampled so far. From what I understand from my other, more ""tech-savvy"" smartphone-owing pros, this is great.  Will advise if anything changes after i've had it for more than one month, but I don't foresee that happening.  Just love it. OH- I specifically got an unblocked phone so I could shop around (I'm in Florida). I decided on Verizon, but they were unable to make this phone compatible with their system. Something about CDMA vs. GSM.

"1217","beautiful display but then there is Bixby. why samsung? they really want to be intrusive I guess!  most annoying thing ever, even more than the wrap edges... butt dials like you have never seen except it is opening all kinds of things in my back pocket so be sure to lock bone the display.  display is gorgeous, battery life solid after a few months yay!- and it gives warnings if moisture sensed in charging port. nice.  beautiful phone and great camera but annoying as heck sometimes."" Honest Opinion"" put a nice true review I think
            "
"1218","I already had an S8 that I got through Verizon so I knew I liked the phone. It's sleek and beautiful and is practically my personal assistant. I wasn't sure if this unlocked version would be simple to activate, but we took the Verizon SIM card out of my daughter's dying S6 and put it in the S8 and it works perfectly, calls, texts, apps, etc. We didn't even have to go online to activate it! And if she wants to switch carriers, she can just get a new SIM card. This unlocked phone is the way to go.

"1219","Entirely too fragile, screen broke after phone dropped two feet in a case. First time I have ever cracked a screen and I have dropped other galaxy and Apple phones further with zero damage. Repairs are almost as much as a new phone, ridiculous....looking at several owner forums it seems to be a design flaw
            "
"1220","Beautiful, sleek design. I mainly use this device for messaging and playing fps mobile games, and don't notice any lagging issues due to the phone processor. Lagging is typically from a fluctuating wifi connection. Touch sensitivity is perfect, even with a screen protector. Apps open quickly. Use headphones, because phone speakers are not comparable to your surround sound system. I'd highly recommend getting a case and screen protector, as the entire phone is encased in glass, which makes the device prone to cracks.
            "
"1221","This is my last Samsung product after having had 3 previously. I have to update my phone every year due to issues that fall just outside of warranty and it's getting to be a very expensive habit.

"1224","I've had my phone since maybe August. I immediately put a screen protector and case on the thing. Screen has two cracks, and it's not worth paying Verizon my deductible to get another just like it. The edge screen is not protected well by any case I've tried, so that's where cracks form. Also, it's impossible to get a decent screen protector that sits well on the screen if you're using a case. I am terribly disappointed.
            "
"1225","I purchased the phone and I transferred my data from my s7 in turn it made the phone not function properly. It wouldn't read my sim card. The volume bottom was not working so I couldn't hear conversations unless I had the phone on speaker. Two days of this and I did a master reset. Phone is working now but the in call volume is still an issue.  I would have loved to have everything transfer over without an issue. The phones camera is so awesome though. It's super clear! The split screen makes me love this phone. Samsung over Apple for sure. I was unsure when I originally switched but the pros outweigh the cons. The expandable memory is a huge plus! I'm sure as I get more familiar with this phone I'll learn to love it 100%
            "
"1226","Came from jailbroken iPhone because I thought I could do whatever I want with my android after I bought it, such as rooting. Samsung apparently didn't get the memo of what android stands for, user customizability. Rooting is damn near impossible on this crappy phone. This phone misses on all the little things I didn't appreciate on my iphone. These things include actually sending music metadata to my car over Bluetooth, not unlocking my phone everytime Bluetooth makes and ends a call, not unlocking my phone when I miss a call.
            "

"1229","Bixby, is new voice assistant from samsung,  that can't be deleted.  if you like  alexis, and google voice, now you have a new voice command.  if you don't want that, tough.the extra button on the left side will activate Bixby, and can not be deactivated -per samsung tech support.  I can't recommend this phone because of bixby.
            "
"1230","Definitely one of the best of 2017.Not giving 5star because Samsung chose to play safe with quick charge 2.0 rather than using a more recent iteration

"1231","I wish i had bought one that wasnt unlocked. It prevents me from seeing voicemail and only allows me to swipe to open in one direction and doesnt always allow auto direction of screen. My screen broke first time i dropped it. I have a case on it but not the greatest( obviously :( )it still works but im sure its not waterproof any longer.
            "
"1232","If you don't mind surrendering your integrity by lying, saying you've read the thousands of legal words about Bixby, you can use the app. OTOH, if you prefer to retain your integrity (but don't want to spend the time to read all of that), it remains unusable, but will pop up anyway every time you accidentally hit the physical button toward the middle of the left side of the phone. There were ways to remap this with apps, but Samsung apparently got around that with the latest update, showing their complete disdain for their customers. This is not my first Samsung, but will probably be my last.
            "
"1233","So disappointed in this phone.  The bezeled edge makes it difficult to hit certain buttons, ads are popping up all of the time.  Just not a good phone, so many things have changed, and in a bad way.  Things just disappear off of the screen, ie, phone call, alarm, music, and I can't get them back easily.  Just plain sucks!!!!  Been using for about 3 months now and wish I had purchased an iphone.  Have been an Android fan for about a decade.  Definitely will next time.

"1234","Love This phone. Was a little hard to type with the curved screen at first. I kept bumping letters with the sides of hands while hanging on to the phone. I recommend a case for it. Once I put that on I didn't have any more problems because now my hands are resting on the case and not on the actual screen. I use an otter box.

"1237","This is the worst NON apple phone ever.  It is very slick and difficult to handle, resulting in it frequently crashing to the floor.  I have used several apps that require the phone to be rest by removing frquently the battery--something that cannot be done with the S8.  The curved screen results in apps too often being opened inadvertently.  There appears to be no way to disable Bixby and the button is in a very difficult spot to avoid--extremely annoying.  Much of the functionality of previous devices is gone or virtually impossible to find.  Worst of all, IT CAME WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS!!!!!!!!!!!  THIS WILL BE MY LAST SAMSUNG PHONE.

"1242","I've had this phone for a day.  It was an emergency replacement for my S7.  I wasn't too excited about upgrading to the 8 for 1 reason... the lack of a physical home button.  I thought that like everything else in the touch screen world, the new home area would be unresponsive at times and I've been right.  Several times today, I've had to tap the home area 2 or 3 times before the phone realizes I want it to wake up.The other issue is the location of the fingerprint reader.  Now on the back of the phone, it's tough to get your finger lined up properly without flipping the phone over to look at what you're doing,  The facial recognition seems to be pretty good though.The performance seems great.  It's very responsive.  Some of the new shortcuts seem helpful.  I'm sure I'll get used to it over the coming weeks, but out of the box, I think Samsung should have left some things alone.

"1243","Excellent product.I come from Xperia smartphones, this is my first galaxy and truly it's the best, It's worth.Package arrived in time and with all the stuffs (quick charger, usb cable, earphones (not the best).Highly recommended, with quick charge you can charge it at 100 percent in aprox 1 hour.

            "
"1245","After great experiences with my s4 & Note 4 i couldn't pass up the Prime day deal on the S8. The camera is crazy and the phone itself is solid as a brick (and looks  good just sitting there). Nougat and Bixby take some getting used to (I haven't given up and resorted to a custom launcher yet). You can't customize LED colors for different apps/callers. There's still one tiny speaker instead of adopting stereo speakers like other companies. But my biggest complaint is the Bluetooth is Fubar. The forums are full of people that can't get this series phone to sync with radios or speakers. I've tried three cars and two speakers and the only thing it successfully pairs with is the controller for the VR headset. Thankfully my Note4 works just fine for mobile entertainment, but I can't use my car's hands-free calling features.It's a fine phone, Still has a headphone jack...which apparently I'll need for music since the Bluetooth doesn't work right, but is missing stuff that should have been caught before shipping.

P.o.s.Additional cons (as I use the phone, I will update the cons area, I highly doubt the pros field will get updated, samsung really has to show me something special here)""Can't back up data""  Because OF COURSE samsung sells a 64 gig phone with FULL intention of NOT providing that much much cloud storage and then AUTOMATICALLY SETS UP CLOUD STORAGE because we don't care about the customer, you will still buy our garbage is why.Pro: the ONLY reason I own this trash is because it's the absolutely only phone with 64 gigs on my network.However, I love my provider soooo much I am not willing to leave them.  BOOST needs more LG's!!!There's tons more negatives dealing with wireless charging, bluetooth fails, trash wifi...  but at least I have storage (whoever's bright idea it was to remove the move app to sd function, you need to just quit, you suck so much) for my two games, yes, only flippin 2.  Maybe I'll just quit android all together next time.  And after my S2 and s4 experiences I really don't know what the heck I was thinking.  Just do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS.

I'm a military brat and still never liked to use military time.  Not a fan of Bixby either.

"1259","Bought at Sam's Club. 17 days after owning the phone it would no longer charge at the port. There was  defect in the connection. I contacted the company.  They had me send in the phone for repair.  Eleven days later (yesterday) I got my phone back. Charging port worked fine, but then the phone kept shutting down and restarting. I couldn't even get it to stay on long enough to set it up. I contacted the company again and I have sent off the phone again for repairs. Where the phone is barely used I wish they would just replace it so that I could have an experience without a defective phone.  I spent a lot of money on this phone.  The phone is beautiful in design, but I was not going for beauty, just reliability, and it failed, miserably.  Because of this experience with the phone and customer service, this is, most likely, my last Samsung phone purchase. If you buy this phone, you'll need the warranty. Unfortunately,  I didn't buy the warranty. I had already paid more than intended for the phone. I didn't have the funds for the warranty.

"1261","Disappointing.  I was looking forward to upgrading from Note 4 to 8.  Once I saw/held the 8, I decided to stick with the 4.  The 8 is too long and skinny making it inconvenient to read on, it breaks to easily and is slips out of the hand easier.  By now, all phones should be stronger/more impact resistant for dropping without a case.  Hopefully the Note 9 will be better meaning shorter, wider and stronger.

"1270","1rst and biggest, you have to get a case. This phone is so slippery it's silly. I set it on a pillow the other morning it would not stay.  gravity slowly Slid it off. I've dropped this 600$ phone twice in less than a week. It has rounded/tappered edges hardly any bezel to get a purchase on. Yes this is normally a good thing, but dropping sucks.2nd finger print sensor is in a poorly thought out spot next to camera lens. It's hard to say where to place it because it feels natural where they put it. Maybe move camera, Regardless your camera lens Will be smudged.3rd bixby not interested in it and I don't have a choice. The dedicated button is in the worst spot.  If I hold phone in landscape to take pic, watch video, or what ever I hit the button (by the way I'm left handed) with thumb. Phone is so slick holding in landscape position is precarious already. Samsung and bloatware, bixby is to much and to dedicate an annoying button to it is absolutely dumb.4th the screen is curved on edges and can be touched or tapped. I have big hands, phone is slick, phone is thin, and edges are round so i try to grip it good especially in landscape. Watching a YouTube video as an example either I hit bixby button or  accidently hit top left corner  of screen dropping notifications bar down or in YouTube back video up 10 seconds(how i am double tapping is beyond me). I have ordered a case it's been a week waiting on shipping I hope this fixes most of these problems. Being one of the more expensive phones out there, You would think these things would be thought through.5th I liked having removable battery option but LG doesn't offer any more. So I am assuming no decent smart phone has that option anymore. But on average I get a new phone every 2-3 years and generally battery would be replaced once in that time. 600$-700$ it should last that long. Seems to be a rant but for the money it should be better. And for god sakes stop with the bloatware, and a dedicated physical button. Seems like your are trying to piss off customers.

The other 40 % of the time will say that it has moisture in the port and will refuse to charge.After the first 3 months the phone becomes extremely sluggish when moving between apps and different home screens, while I am use to this slowdown on mobile devices, this is the only time it started slowing down before I had owned it for a single quarter.This phone will give you about as much functionality as one of those old Nokia phones with how sluggish, inconsistent and poorly constructed it is.

I hate the typing as its no where near Apple.  Koreans never bother to learn English anyway so its not hard to understand.  Its beneath them to do such.  The phone calls coming in on top of the current call take away as the beep just continues over and over.  The music player is lacking as well.  Text are also a pain as app compete with other apps for default status.  Such a pain.  I will probably try LG next.  Samsung products are high tech but mostly crap from what I have seen in my years.

I do not like the taller form factor as compared to the S6.  This one sticks out of my  jean pocket a bit.  And I am not a fan of the Bixby button.  I understand the money involved in Samsung getting into the voice business but the location of the Bixby button is terrible.. there has got to be another way.  I disabled mine but when the S8 upgrades to Android One UI it will no longer be possible to fully disable it.  I also prefer a flat screen to a screen with curved edges.  The S7 and Note 5 had a curved edges on the back side which was nice because the screen was flat but the curved edge was still a bit more grippy than the standard edge.  Despite my notes.. this is a great phone.. I recommend it.
