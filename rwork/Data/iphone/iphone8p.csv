"1","Ordered 2 and one is perfect condition just like new! The other one has 2 small scratches on the side. 1 month after use, the screen on one side is darker... and my boyfriends phone cracked by just being in his pocket. Don¡¯t buy this phone, spend a little more for brand new.
            "
"2","HONESTLY, i really was indecisive reading some of the reviews on here. Some were great and others not so much. I order my Iphone 8 Plus from ""My Wit"". It came faster than i expected  AND Its like in perfect condition. Works like its brand new, sim card synced perfectly. I have Family mobile which is similar to metro PC etc. If youre going to buy this item buy from MYWIT you wont be disappointed. If i can edit this post ill post pictures later
            "
"3","I love this phone!! Reviews were a bit bias but it works amazing! Came in a white box with an adapter, usb cable and the phone. Runs smoothly & efficiently.
            "
"4","This phone works amazing. No scratches or dings when i got it. Only thing was, it doesn¡¯t come with headphones or a dongle. And the charger they gave me was not working at all. I tried different outlets, different power blocks, and even a different cord to make sure it wasnt the phone. So definitely expect to buy ALL your own attachments
            "
"5","Perfect condition and as described
            "
"6","I love it! Actually better than I expected! And yes it works with Metro PCS
            "
"7","Beautiful and exactly  like new.  I prefer refurbished because the phone goes through more rigorous testing than the brand new ones.Gave this phone to my son for his 2nd MBA graduation and he loves it.  Says it¡¯s super fast in every aspect.  Guess so because he went from an iPhone 5.
            "
"8","Traveling without any worry of not having any local communication is a great plus having this phone. Just buy their sim card and your done. If you use the USA sim then you will be charged very large (international calls) but if you buy the country (where you are going) sim card (switching your sim card to local sim card) will be a big plus to you.
            "
"9","Lo compre con miedo a recibir algo danado o mal reparado, vino en ina caja normal y con un cargador normal,la vida de bateria estaba al 90% y venia con vidrio templado ya instalado.Por el precio y el envio rapido obtuve mas de lo que pague.Muy satisfecho con la compra.Puse mi sim card (soy de un pais fuera de USA) y reconocio mi linea sin problemas.¢®Muy recomendado!
            "
"10","Purchased this with the intention they were refurbished... but instead is just a repackaged used phone.  The screens are scratched and one has a nice gouge.  For the price they should have replaced the screens.  These are not refurbished phones.  If you need a fully refurbished phone, looks somewhere else.  They do come with a third party cable and charging adapter.
            "
"11","Phone was completely defective. Had a hard time to switch on the phone. And once it was switched on, it got restarted every 2 min. Wasted full day on this phone. And now, it gets to old situation again where the phone is not able to switched on. Don't know why the phone was not tested. Since it is refurbished phone, it should be tested more for any defects.
            "
"12","Product came with a functionality issue. The phone would cut my voice in and out as I was talking to people. Eventually the phone became useless and it was returned.
            "
"13","It worked perfectly no scratches or dings. It even came with an already applied screen protected! The charging cable and block work perfectly and it isn¡¯t slow or glitchy. You wouldn¡¯t even know it was refurbished except that it didn¡¯t come with headphones or an apple box which is fine with me
            "
"14","Good condition. All around great
            "
"15","So far is working great. Pretty much like a brand new iphone out of the box.
            "
"16","Love my iPhone 8plus! Could not connect to boost mobile. Connected to metro pcs works great
            "
"17","Me encanto! Esta como nuevo, todo funciona a la perfeccion. Lo uso en Ecuador sin ningun problema.
            "
"18","Well first of all, the item arrived 5 days later than expected.. when I finally got it I found out the phone has an iCloud lock and it turns out I have to pay more to unlock it... till this day I don¡¯t know if the phone works or not because my iTunes cannot activate it. I have Tmobile and ATT cards which specified that it would work with I don¡¯t know if it¡¯s a sim problem or iCloud problem like most people and researc tells me.Total Scam.
            "
"19","The phone had came scratched from the back, less than half battery, and a weird ¡°cube¡± to charge (that looks very cheap) but overall the phone looks like it works. I will give updates if it stops working.UPDATE: I TRIED TO CONNECT IT AND THEY SAID THE PHONE WAS STOLEN!!!

            "
"22","The phone arrived on time and was packaged well. This phone was for my son, and he says it works great. The only complaint is the screen had scratches on it and that's the reason I gave it four stars. Everything else is great.
            "
"23","I LOVE THIS PHONE! It came with no scratches or marks and super clean. When I unboxed it had a key for my SIM card slot and my phone has a glass screen protector already on it. Put my Straight Talk SIM card in and immediately got service. Couldn¡¯t have asked for a better phone! Perfect condition and was worth every penny!
            "
"24","Maximum capacity show 88% very disappointing.may have to have the battery replaced sadly. Other than that seems to be in very good shape. Came with a screen protector already on it and small scratched on the bottom near the speaker. After some use noticed when watching Netflix the image in very blurry. Sending the phone back!! I would not waste money on something like this again not worth the 500$ headache
            "
"25","I love my new Apple iPhone 8 Plus. It is a Great phone at a Great price! The only thing that I dislike is that there is a tiny scratch on the glass at the bottom, but since it is refurbished I cannot expect perfection! It is easy to use so far and I also got a shock proof case to help protect it from getting damaged. I made the switch from a Samsung to an Apple so I am still getting used to the changes, but so far, so good!
            "
"26","Everything worked great, except I bought two phones. One phone was like new, but the other phone had a battery health of 80%. Very disappointed, and would buy from another seller in the future.
            "
"27","This thing is great - more polished than the newer iPhones with a more reasonable price. Storage is ok, kinda wished I had gotten the 256gig even tho I don¡¯t really need it.
            "
"28","No me agrado el producto, tenia severos danos en el marco, golpes y scratches.Se supone viene restaurado con buenas prestaciones esteticas. Muy mala compra.
            "
"29","It can be scary to purchase such a big item online used n refurbished but this phone was absolutely better than expected! Exact same as a brand new one n the process of setting up was exactly like buying one straight from Apple straight outta the box! Will always buy my phones from this seller! Thank God for honest n good sellers of electronics like this seller! So very very happy with my phone! Thank u!
            "
"30","Fast delivery and shipping.  Satisfied product condition with 93% maximum battery capacity when it is fully charged.
            "
"31","I love this phone! I was so skeptical about buying this refurbished and just the scares that come from that but I got my phone within a week and a half and no problems!!! It actually looked brand new when I got it. No scratches, no dents, NOTHING! Absolutely a wonderful company to buy refurbished phones from. Definitely recommend!!!
            "
"32","Never buy from buy spry. The $709 iPhone is faulty and I have had it 45 days and work in China. This a total rip off
            "
"33","The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I only bought it for the camera and the studio lighting feature. Well had I known it was this crappy I wouldn¡¯t have spent the extra couple hundred and just got the 7 plus. I see no difference from this and the iPhone 7 (minus the camera). So if the camera and it¡¯s features aren¡¯t important to you, get the 7 plus!!! Other than that this phone is great. It doesn¡¯t even seem like it¡¯s used at all!! Got an Apple charger included in the box! I haven¡¯t had a single issue!! Don¡¯t let the bad ratings change your mind!
            "
"34","Came 3 days earlier than expected delivery date. Minimal cosmetic damages and came in good packing. I like that it came with its original chargers. Would buy again.
            "
"35","I was hesitant to make this purchase because of some of the bad reviews but my phone is perfect - little to no noticeable wear, no scratches or anything like that. I easily set it up with cricket in a matter of minutes. The battery life and camera are great. With the 3 month warranty and the insurance option you really can¡¯t go wrong with this phone and it¡¯s a hell of a lot cheaper than buying new.
            "
"36","Don¡¯t buy this product... the quality of the screen is bad. The phone was used
            "
"37","Very pleased with phone and delivery time.
            "
"38","Battery great , looks brand new. No problems what so ever ! Reviews threw me a little off but we got it from buyspry and it perfect, ordered my husband one also and his is perfect also.
            "
"39","Cuando llego el telefono era inutilizable ya que el propietario original lo tiene bloqueado con find my iphone, el boton de inicio de un colo diferente al del telefono y ademas flojo o mal instalado. No vale nada el producto y cobran cientos de dolares
            "
"40","Too a risk ordering online. The phone came early. No earphones but came with a charger and a screen protectorThere¡¯s like a few paint chips on the bottom where the screws are but I only noticed because I read some of the reviews and was really looking for them battery chargers to 100% and lasts me all day so far. No scratches or scrapes or dents anywhere on the phone. I¡¯d definitely recommend anyone.
            "
"41","My note 4 was acting terribly. I have an iPad and like the way the phone and iPad work together. Plus I like turning off the ringer with just a flip of a switch.
            "
"42","This phone works great the reason I gave a 4 is because sometimes the light moves up on it's on. But my daughter loves it! Better than the iPhone 7plus we ordered last year
            "
"43","It work good
            "
"44","I was scared at first to buy this phone cause it was pre-owned but it's in extremely good condition practically brand new even though it doesn't come in original apple packaging. I heavily recommend anyone to get this phone it's better than paying 700$ from the apple website
            "
"45","Mostly in good condition but has a small scratch on the front glass.  Unfortunately I need a phone for business so I cannot wait the time to send back and get replaced

            "
"150","The phone came in a generic as stated and seams to be working so far but did not come with earphone or connector other than the USB cable charger.
            "
"151","Phone was in pristine condition but it was completely defective i charged it for 2 hours straight and it would not boot up. Would recommend to just purchase from Apple retailer.
            "
"152","I have been an Android guy for a very long time because of how user friendly the phones have been...until I started using iPhones at work, and then the metamorphosis happened.The phone I had was outdated, and decided to take a chance and saw the iPhone 8 Plus, and decided to pull the trigger on this purchase. My perception changed completely. The phone came earlier than anticipated, and as soon as I opened the box, the phone was ready to go. I just popped the SIM card in, and it took off from there.The iPhone 8 Plus is so smooth and the OS is incredible. I love this phone and doubt I will ever go back to Android phones again.The phone came in pristine condition and the charger is officially an Apple product, and charges the phone incredibly fast.
            "
"153","The phone wouldn¡¯t work when I put the SIM card in it and also the the speakers are so scratched up at the bottom of the phone that it makes the audio sound bad

"156","So far so good should I say. Phone looked and performs as brand new and came in after 2 days of shipping! Said it would come in May 3rd but came in April 28. Best phone yet! Especially if you¡¯re not ready to change up the original kind of type iPhone. I wasnt ready to upgrade to the Iphone X bc I love having my home button and the feels of the original iPhones that I just dont see with the iPhone X, I see an android. Im sticking with the 8 plus<U+0001F937><U+0001F3FC><U+200D>¡Ï<U+FE0F> But great phone so far!
            "
"157","Upgrading from a 6s, I see some performance improvement, not huge like my previous upgrade from a 5 to 6s.Other than that, the dual camera system is nice, there¡¯s not much else to mention compared to my 6s. The fake home button (not a real button that depresses) does take a day or two to get use to.Some people may not like the removal of the earphone jack, but I¡¯ve always used Bluetooth headphones anyway. One less port for them to worry about waterproofing.
            "
"158","I received this phone with a 88% maximum capacity for battery life. My sisters I phone six which she¡¯s had for over a year currently has a 94% maximum capacity for battery life. I¡¯m really upset after noticing this wish it wasn¡¯t so expensive if the battery wasn¡¯t replaced or new. Super annoying if I¡¯m being honest <U+0001F644>. Other wise the phone works perfectly fine but of course the battery life is a huge factor.
            "
"159","Switching from being an avid high end android user the 8 plus is decent but at times lacking. The camera overall is good but I am biased as having a 200+ FPS ability previously is an adjustment. Overall I like the phone and would easily give 4 stars except for having the dreaded microphone glitch. According to apple along with being apple certified I haven¡¯t yet determined if it¡¯s hardware or software since it¡¯s very intermittent. Hard resetting per apples advice is not conclusive and may have to exchange.

"160","Super relieved to say that this purchase went smoothly and everything's just as expected. Everything is as promised, right down to the finish. It was a birthday gift for our daughter and she's delighted with it. The camera is head and shoulders above her older model. It came ready to go right outside of the box. She had to do very little in terms of setup, and she found it intuitive.Good to know: You'll have to order earbuds to go with this. They are not included.Quick delivery. You have to be home to sign for it.

"163","After reading the reviews I was scared to purchase but my phone is amazing , it came with little to no scratches and it looks brand new<U+0001F495> it even came with a cute little charger and I love it. I purchased from BuySPRY<U+0001F495> I do recommend<U+0001F495>
            "
"164","When I first received the phone, my earbuds sounded crackly, I emailed the seller right away and asked them to advise.  Before I received their response a friend of mine showed me how to clean the lightning port, and the phone was fixed. Then I received emails from the seller, 100% ready to right any wrongs. I told them I had cleaned the port, and decided to keep the phone. They were very helpful.The phone is not in new condition, but it¡¯s in good condition and has been working as it should for 2 months now.

"165","I am very pleased with the iPhone 8 Plus. It was flawless in both appearance and performance. It was delivered quickly and the price was great too. The only problem was practical: getting off Android and onto iOS. I am very happy with the new handset and plan on using it for many years.
            "
"166","Hesitated at first but very satisfied when the package arrived. Had it for 5 days and so far so good. iPhone looks brand new even have a screen protector on it. It also comes with lighting cable. Not a single scratch. Really worth the money
            "
"167","I am very happy with the purchase of this iPhone. It works great and I¡¯ve not had any issues with it at all. It looks and works like a brand new phone, but for a much better price. Would definitely buy it on here again in the future!

"169","Excellent 5 stars

"170","Awesome phone no problems brand new and they give you the actual apple charger!!! If they would have included headphones I would have fell in love but I highly recommend. I¡¯ve had this phone for 2 months no issues at all super sleek super fast and I only charge my phone once every other day because it can hold a charge well

            "
"174","Refurbished must mean damaged. This this performs like a phone at the end of its life, not the beginning.

"184","I went from the iPhone 6 to the iPhone 8 Plus. I considered the X, but just didn't care for that annoying notch, narrower aspect ratio and lack of touch ID, so the 8 Plus was preferable to the X. The bigger screen is a must (especially for people like myself who are always working and rely on a phone when we're away from the office.) You won't regret it!The 8 Plus is extremely heavy compared to the aluminum iPhones; it took me awhile to adjust. After comparing it to the iPhone X, I feel the 8 Plus's heft gives it a premium feel. I just wish they would have at least narrowed the bezels even a smidge. It's past due time for a refresh.The 8 plus has an incredible battery life! The true tone feature is definitely worth the hype and the camera is amazing! I use it all the time and people sometimes ask me ""what kind of DLSR do you have?"" They can't believe I took the photo on my iPhone!
            "
"185","I ended up finding a brand new 8+ for the same price as this one so I never used it and returned it when I got it.However, I opened the box to see what I would have dealt with if I had decided to keep it. It was boxed nicely, it comes with a (non-Apple) charger and a pre-installed screen protector which I thought was a nice touch.I never powered it on but the phone looked 100% good except for a scratch on the screen in the middle right. For a refurbished phone I actually think it is acceptable so I wasn¡¯t disappointed.Sending back to seller just because I don¡¯t need it anymore, otherwise I think I would have kept it.I¡¯m assuming that the phone would have powered on and worked if I had charged it. It came with 0 battery life so it wouldn¡¯t turn on when I got it, but acted like it was charging when I set it on my wireless charger for a second.Overall it is a great buy<U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FC>

"191","Good day, I bought this phone a month ago, I brought it to Ecuador, when I entered the SIM card I did not read it. For that reason I was a technician where he told me that he needs to know with which operator worked before the cell phone to open the band of the phone and that this can work here, can you help me with this information, please.

"196","Ordered 2 and one is perfect condition just like new! The other one has 2 small scratches on the side. 1 month after use, the screen on one side is darker... and my boyfriends phone cracked by just being in his pocket. Don¡¯t buy this phone, spend a little more for brand new.
            "
"197","HONESTLY, i really was indecisive reading some of the reviews on here. Some were great and others not so much. I order my Iphone 8 Plus from ""My Wit"". It came faster than i expected  AND Its like in perfect condition. Works like its brand new, sim card synced perfectly. I have Family mobile which is similar to metro PC etc. If youre going to buy this item buy from MYWIT you wont be disappointed. If i can edit this post ill post pictures later
            "
"198","I love this phone!! Reviews were a bit bias but it works amazing! Came in a white box with an adapter, usb cable and the phone. Runs smoothly & efficiently.
            "
"199","This phone works amazing. No scratches or dings when i got it. Only thing was, it doesn¡¯t come with headphones or a dongle. And the charger they gave me was not working at all. I tried different outlets, different power blocks, and even a different cord to make sure it wasnt the phone. So definitely expect to buy ALL your own attachments
            "
"200","Perfect condition and as described
            "
"201","I love it! Actually better than I expected! And yes it works with Metro PCS
            "
"202","Beautiful and exactly  like new.  I prefer refurbished because the phone goes through more rigorous testing than the brand new ones.Gave this phone to my son for his 2nd MBA graduation and he loves it.  Says it¡¯s super fast in every aspect.  Guess so because he went from an iPhone 5.
            "
"203","Traveling without any worry of not having any local communication is a great plus having this phone. Just buy their sim card and your done. If you use the USA sim then you will be charged very large (international calls) but if you buy the country (where you are going) sim card (switching your sim card to local sim card) will be a big plus to you.
            "
"204","Lo compre con miedo a recibir algo danado o mal reparado, vino en ina caja normal y con un cargador normal,la vida de bateria estaba al 90% y venia con vidrio templado ya instalado.Por el precio y el envio rapido obtuve mas de lo que pague.Muy satisfecho con la compra.Puse mi sim card (soy de un pais fuera de USA) y reconocio mi linea sin problemas.¢®Muy recomendado!
            "
"205","Purchased this with the intention they were refurbished... but instead is just a repackaged used phone.  The screens are scratched and one has a nice gouge.  For the price they should have replaced the screens.  These are not refurbished phones.  If you need a fully refurbished phone, looks somewhere else.  They do come with a third party cable and charging adapter.
            "
"206","Phone was completely defective. Had a hard time to switch on the phone. And once it was switched on, it got restarted every 2 min. Wasted full day on this phone. And now, it gets to old situation again where the phone is not able to switched on. Don't know why the phone was not tested. Since it is refurbished phone, it should be tested more for any defects.
            "
"207","Product came with a functionality issue. The phone would cut my voice in and out as I was talking to people. Eventually the phone became useless and it was returned.
            "
"208","It worked perfectly no scratches or dings. It even came with an already applied screen protected! The charging cable and block work perfectly and it isn¡¯t slow or glitchy. You wouldn¡¯t even know it was refurbished except that it didn¡¯t come with headphones or an apple box which is fine with me
            "
"209","Good condition. All around great

"210","So far is working great. Pretty much like a brand new iphone out of the box.

"212","Me encanto! Esta como nuevo, todo funciona a la perfeccion. Lo uso en Ecuador sin ningun problema.
            "
"213","Well first of all, the item arrived 5 days later than expected.. when I finally got it I found out the phone has an iCloud lock and it turns out I have to pay more to unlock it... till this day I don¡¯t know if the phone works or not because my iTunes cannot activate it. I have Tmobile and ATT cards which specified that it would work with I don¡¯t know if it¡¯s a sim problem or iCloud problem like most people and researc tells me.Total Scam.
            "
"214","The phone had came scratched from the back, less than half battery, and a weird ¡°cube¡± to charge (that looks very cheap) but overall the phone looks like it works. I will give updates if it stops working.UPDATE: I TRIED TO CONNECT IT AND THEY SAID THE PHONE WAS STOLEN!!!

"218","I LOVE THIS PHONE! It came with no scratches or marks and super clean. When I unboxed it had a key for my SIM card slot and my phone has a glass screen protector already on it. Put my Straight Talk SIM card in and immediately got service. Couldn¡¯t have asked for a better phone! Perfect condition and was worth every penny!
            "
"219","Maximum capacity show 88% very disappointing.may have to have the battery replaced sadly. Other than that seems to be in very good shape. Came with a screen protector already on it and small scratched on the bottom near the speaker. After some use noticed when watching Netflix the image in very blurry. Sending the phone back!! I would not waste money on something like this again not worth the 500$ headache
            "
"220","I love my new Apple iPhone 8 Plus. It is a Great phone at a Great price! The only thing that I dislike is that there is a tiny scratch on the glass at the bottom, but since it is refurbished I cannot expect perfection! It is easy to use so far and I also got a shock proof case to help protect it from getting damaged. I made the switch from a Samsung to an Apple so I am still getting used to the changes, but so far, so good!
            "
"221","Everything worked great, except I bought two phones. One phone was like new, but the other phone had a battery health of 80%. Very disappointed, and would buy from another seller in the future.

It actually looked brand new when I got it. No scratches, no dents, NOTHING! Absolutely a wonderful company to buy refurbished phones from. Definitely recommend!!!
            "
"227","Never buy from buy spry. The $709 iPhone is faulty and I have had it 45 days and work in China. This a total rip off
            "
"228","The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I only bought it for the camera and the studio lighting feature. Well had I known it was this crappy I wouldn¡¯t have spent the extra couple hundred and just got the 7 plus. I see no difference from this and the iPhone 7 (minus the camera). So if the camera and it¡¯s features aren¡¯t important to you, get the 7 plus!!! Other than that this phone is great. It doesn¡¯t even seem like it¡¯s used at all!! Got an Apple charger included in the box! I haven¡¯t had a single issue!! Don¡¯t let the bad ratings change your mind!
            "
"229","Came 3 days earlier than expected delivery date. Minimal cosmetic damages and came in good packing. I like that it came with its original chargers. Would buy again.

"230","I was hesitant to make this purchase because of some of the bad reviews but my phone is perfect - little to no noticeable wear, no scratches or anything like that. I easily set it up with cricket in a matter of minutes. The battery life and camera are great. With the 3 month warranty and the insurance option you really can¡¯t go wrong with this phone and it¡¯s a hell of a lot cheaper than buying new.

"235","Too a risk ordering online. The phone came early. No earphones but came with a charger and a screen protectorThere¡¯s like a few paint chips on the bottom where the screws are but I only noticed because I read some of the reviews and was really looking for them battery chargers to 100% and lasts me all day so far. No scratches or scrapes or dents anywhere on the phone. I¡¯d definitely recommend anyone.

"344","I love it! brand new phone and came earlier than expected. came with a charger and nice box for shipping.
            "
"345","The phone came in a generic as stated and seams to be working so far but did not come with earphone or connector other than the USB cable charger.
            "
"346","Phone was in pristine condition but it was completely defective i charged it for 2 hours straight and it would not boot up. Would recommend to just purchase from Apple retailer.
            "
"347","I have been an Android guy for a very long time because of how user friendly the phones have been...until I started using iPhones at work, and then the metamorphosis happened.The phone I had was outdated, and decided to take a chance and saw the iPhone 8 Plus, and decided to pull the trigger on this purchase. My perception changed completely. The phone came earlier than anticipated, and as soon as I opened the box, the phone was ready to go. I just popped the SIM card in, and it took off from there.The iPhone 8 Plus is so smooth and the OS is incredible. I love this phone and doubt I will ever go back to Android phones again.The phone came in pristine condition and the charger is officially an Apple product, and charges the phone incredibly fast.
            "
"348","The phone wouldn¡¯t work when I put the SIM card in it and also the the speakers are so scratched up at the bottom of the phone that it makes the audio sound bad

"351","So far so good should I say. Phone looked and performs as brand new and came in after 2 days of shipping! Said it would come in May 3rd but came in April 28. Best phone yet! Especially if you¡¯re not ready to change up the original kind of type iPhone. I wasnt ready to upgrade to the Iphone X bc I love having my home button and the feels of the original iPhones that I just dont see with the iPhone X, I see an android. Im sticking with the 8 plus<U+0001F937><U+0001F3FC><U+200D>¡Ï<U+FE0F> But great phone so far!
            "
"352","Upgrading from a 6s, I see some performance improvement, not huge like my previous upgrade from a 5 to 6s.Other than that, the dual camera system is nice, there¡¯s not much else to mention compared to my 6s. The fake home button (not a real button that depresses) does take a day or two to get use to.Some people may not like the removal of the earphone jack, but I¡¯ve always used Bluetooth headphones anyway. One less port for them to worry about waterproofing.
            "
"353","I received this phone with a 88% maximum capacity for battery life. My sisters I phone six which she¡¯s had for over a year currently has a 94% maximum capacity for battery life. I¡¯m really upset after noticing this wish it wasn¡¯t so expensive if the battery wasn¡¯t replaced or new. Super annoying if I¡¯m being honest <U+0001F644>. Other wise the phone works perfectly fine but of course the battery life is a huge factor.
            "
"354","Switching from being an avid high end android user the 8 plus is decent but at times lacking. The camera overall is good but I am biased as having a 200+ FPS ability previously is an adjustment. Overall I like the phone and would easily give 4 stars except for having the dreaded microphone glitch. According to apple along with being apple certified I haven¡¯t yet determined if it¡¯s hardware or software since it¡¯s very intermittent. Hard resetting per apples advice is not conclusive and may have to exchange.
            "
"355","Super relieved to say that this purchase went smoothly and everything's just as expected. Everything is as promised, right down to the finish. It was a birthday gift for our daughter and she's delighted with it. The camera is head and shoulders above her older model. It came ready to go right outside of the box. She had to do very little in terms of setup, and she found it intuitive.Good to know: You'll have to order earbuds to go with this. They are not included.Quick delivery. You have to be home to sign for it.

"358","After reading the reviews I was scared to purchase but my phone is amazing , it came with little to no scratches and it looks brand new<U+0001F495> it even came with a cute little charger and I love it. I purchased from BuySPRY<U+0001F495> I do recommend<U+0001F495>
            "
"359","When I first received the phone, my earbuds sounded crackly, I emailed the seller right away and asked them to advise.  Before I received their response a friend of mine showed me how to clean the lightning port, and the phone was fixed. Then I received emails from the seller, 100% ready to right any wrongs. I told them I had cleaned the port, and decided to keep the phone. They were very helpful.The phone is not in new condition, but it¡¯s in good condition and has been working as it should for 2 months now.
            "
"360","I am very pleased with the iPhone 8 Plus. It was flawless in both appearance and performance. It was delivered quickly and the price was great too. The only problem was practical: getting off Android and onto iOS. I am very happy with the new handset and plan on using it for many years.
            "
"361","Hesitated at first but very satisfied when the package arrived. Had it for 5 days and so far so good. iPhone looks brand new even have a screen protector on it. It also comes with lighting cable. Not a single scratch. Really worth the money
            "
"362","I am very happy with the purchase of this iPhone. It works great and I¡¯ve not had any issues with it at all. It looks and works like a brand new phone, but for a much better price. Would definitely buy it on here again in the future!

"365","Awesome phone no problems brand new and they give you the actual apple charger!!! If they would have included headphones I would have fell in love but I highly recommend.

"369","Refurbished must mean damaged. This this performs like a phone at the end of its life, not the beginning.

"379","I went from the iPhone 6 to the iPhone 8 Plus. I considered the X, but just didn't care for that annoying notch, narrower aspect ratio and lack of touch ID, so the 8 Plus was preferable to the X. The bigger screen is a must (especially for people like myself who are always working and rely on a phone when we're away from the office.) You won't regret it!The 8 Plus is extremely heavy compared to the aluminum iPhones; it took me awhile to adjust. After comparing it to the iPhone X, I feel the 8 Plus's heft gives it a premium feel. I just wish they would have at least narrowed the bezels even a smidge. It's past due time for a refresh.The 8 plus has an incredible battery life! The true tone feature is definitely worth the hype and the camera is amazing! I use it all the time and people sometimes ask me ""what kind of DLSR do you have?"" They can't believe I took the photo on my iPhone!
            "
"380","I ended up finding a brand new 8+ for the same price as this one so I never used it and returned it when I got it.However, I opened the box to see what I would have dealt with if I had decided to keep it. It was boxed nicely, it comes with a (non-Apple) charger and a pre-installed screen protector which I thought was a nice touch.I never powered it on but the phone looked 100% good except for a scratch on the screen in the middle right. For a refurbished phone I actually think it is acceptable so I wasn¡¯t disappointed.Sending back to seller just because I don¡¯t need it anymore, otherwise I think I would have kept it.I¡¯m assuming that the phone would have powered on and worked if I had charged it. It came with 0 battery life so it wouldn¡¯t turn on when I got it, but acted like it was charging when I set it on my wireless charger for a second.Overall it is a great buy<U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FC>

"386","Good day, I bought this phone a month ago, I brought it to Ecuador, when I entered the SIM card I did not read it. For that reason I was a technician where he told me that he needs to know with which operator worked before the cell phone to open the band of the phone and that this can work here, can you help me with this information, please.
