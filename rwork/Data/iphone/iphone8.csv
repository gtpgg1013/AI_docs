            "
"2","These cannot possibly be certified refurbished as stated. Both phone batteries were so dead when I received them it took a day to charge. One phone has a camera that does not work.
            "
"3","I researched the iPhone 6,7, and 8 as replacements for my aging 5s. I also sought out sellers with good ratings for this purchase. I settled on MyWit based on their reviews and their volume of sales. The phone arrived a day early and it is absolutely pristine. If it is a refurb, there are zero signs of that as there are no marks anywhere on it. Not even finger prints or dust. It came with a nice flex lighting cable and Apple charger (no sim as advertised).I put the sim card from my old iPhone 5s in it and went through the setup questions. I had a fully functional iPhone 8  in 5 minutes tops.  I selected the iPhone 8 over the 6 or 7 due to the advanced technology in the 8. It is worth the extra $100 over the same size 7.  It is fast but the battery lasts all day without showing significant signs of needing a charge.I also purchased a Speck Candy Shell case for this phone. The iPhone 8 has a glass back for wireless charging and it is very smooth and slick to hold. With my dry fingers, it is difficult to even use the phone so a case is necessary to give it some grip. The Speck case is a perfect, anti-slip and lots of drop and screen protection. See this case here https://www.amazon.com/Speck-Products-CandyShell-Phone-iPhone/dp/B01K094IZ8Very pleased with the seller too and I would certainly use them for another phone purchase without question!

"5","well yes very good the IPhone I said before, but when I proved yesterday the Bluetooth connection, so it¡¯s doesn¡¯t work. Why?And the cuestion is what can I do??? More simple: return the product that doesn¡¯t work.

"6","we buy an unlocked iphone and to open the screen it is asking for a code! very bad service
            "
"7","There were a few small blemishes on the back of the phone that were only noticeable if you look really close.  Otherwise no scratches, dent, or anything else customers mentioned on either of the two phones that I ordered.  It came with a real Apple charger not a knockoff and the phone itself worked perfectly.  I saved $200 over buying a new phone and am super happy.
            "
"8","2 month ago I have purchased above iphone 8 with 64gb. we received in good condition and it is totally dent and scratc. h free. so far working perfectly.
            "
"9","After two bad IPhone purchases on Ebay, both refunded, and no luck finding a decent IPhone 8 on Gazelle I was hesitant to order another pre-owned IPhone. However, this IPhone was as advertised. Mint condition, excellent battery life and yes, it was actually an unlocked  model 1863. Dropped in my MetroPCS sim card and was up and running immediately. Good purchase and would buy again.
            "
"10","It is almost perfect...It takes a while to fully charge, but the battery lasts all day long, esthetically flawless.. not a single scratch.

"12","This is a great product that arrived very timely and looks great!!

"13","I was looking for a reasonably priced iPhone 8 and happened to stumble upon this phone. I was skeptical at first because it was the cheapest I could find anywhere online, however, I couldn¡¯t be happier with my purchase. The phone was advertised as a renewed phone that could vary on the degree of visual usage and battery health. Aside from one scratch on the back glass, the phone is flawless. The battery is also running at 100% capacity which was one of the most important categories for me when buying a new phone. I also checked the IMEI number and model number to find out more information. I was very happy to find that the phone was only 8 months old, and basically brand new with all original parts. This checked all the boxes and I couldn¡¯t be happier with my purchase. For any one that cares my order was fulfilled by CR Land, who has their orders fulfilled by amazon. You can feel safe knowing that if you have to return your item or have any issues you will be dealing with amazon directly. You will not be dealing with the store front who supplies the product which is a plus since amazons return process is relatively painless. I would definitely recommend this product to another person just make sure you watch the prices, they often change and you may miss out on a deal that is up to $40 less than what is usually offered.

"14","Took hours to reach 20% charge; must be a defective while the front and back has no scratch the rounded corner has dents. The phone has been dropped, which most likely lead to the charging issue.In package only the phone is original, plug and cable are oem and no instruction. No lightening to earphone jack adaptor.Read some of the reviews and people had same issues; hope this return isn¡¯t going to someone else?
            "
"15","Exactly what I was hoping for. Great condition barely any scratches! Screen protector and case were included!!! What else could you ask for. I¡¯d buy from this seller again.
            "
"16","Pretty much like new. I was quite skeptical given its Amazon and one step removed from the Wild West but the device is just about like new. A strong battery, no scratches, everything functions well and it even came with a tempered glass screen protector. I¡¯m very impressed with the Renewed program.

The phone is still on as it had 80% charge and it is vibrating when I touch the home button, but the screen does not work. I am now turned off by the whole experience as the phone looked perfect and stopped working out of nowhere.
