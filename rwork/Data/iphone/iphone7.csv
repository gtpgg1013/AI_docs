"1","I¡¯ve seen a lot of bad reviews for this phone based on issues with the seller. Granted, some of those reviews say it took a few weeks for the problems to appear so I¡¯ll edit this if that happens, but wow was I happy with what I got. Not only did it come with a charger (there¡¯s some debate on that in other reviews), but it even had a clear bumper case. That was neither expected nor necessary but I appreciated it (I bought a Unicorn Beetle case which I have used and loved before on other phones). There wasn¡¯t a scratch on this phone and it started working right away for me. The battery seems to be holding up fine. All in all I¡¯d say this seems like a steal. If it self destructs on me in the next few weeks I¡¯ll update this.UPDATE: It's been a few months and a trip overseas since I wrote that initial review, and it remains a solid decision I'm very happy with.
            "
"2","Returning. For one, it was not an unlocked phone. I've had it for a month and the screen has started going black every few minutes, and sometimes it freaks out and tells me I have no way to connect to wifi or cell coverage (despite being somewhere with wifi and usually 4G). I'm returning before the problems escalate.Note- it doesn't come with a charger or with headphones.
            "
"3","Before I even turned it on I tried to put it in a case and saw that the screen had popped out of the casing. The phone wouldn't turn on so I tried to charge it. The cable was loose in the charging port and the phone never powered on!!
            "
"4","Awful. Paid $510 to get a defected camera that does not work. Would not recommend buying from this 3rd party seller. Every time I try to take a picture my phone freezes. Have been trying to reach out to the seller for awhile now and have been unable to contact them.
            "
"5","My son had not had his iPhone 7 for even 3 months when he started experiencing problems.  His phone is well protected with a screen protector and in a case and was not dropped in water.  However, the Home button and keyboard keys stopped functioning.  Since he was unable to even unlock his phone the Apple technician I spoke with online stated a full restore would be needed.  After the restore was complete, an error message appeared stating ""The Home Button May Need Service"".  I was hopeful I would at least be able to setup his phone and update from the Cloud.  But unfortunately, was unable to get beyond the message.  So now I must go to the Apple store in hopes that they will be able to somehow resolve this issue.  I have purchased 2 certified refurbished iPhones in the past, and this is the first time I have any issue or any kind.  But this has been such an incredibly frustrating experience, I can't imagine purchasing another certified refurbished phone.
            "
"6","Just usb cable and charger in box but iphone 7 not in there
            "
"7","I would not recommend this product to anyone. It came scratched, with imitation charger that didn't work, no accessories at all. Don't loose you money.
            "
"8","The refurbished iPhone 7 I ordered for my wife for mother's day was defective. I spent a lot of effort to back up her information and transfer to the new phone, even installed tempered screen protectors, go through the set up process with iPhone, only to discover no signal/service available. i switched sim cards several times and it worked well with my previous iPhones. The unit is defective. I thought refurbished was checked and were good as new. The seller only replied to get my order number and didn't reply again (or is taking too long). I'm not waiting for your reply, I'm just returning everything.
            "
"9","I just got this phone and it¡¯s amazingggg. Great camera quality and easy to transfer my number from my old phone to here. I got it like it was brand new!! I really enjoy it
            "
"10","The iPhone arrived with minor scratches on the back, but other than that the phone works perfectly fine! I have been using it for awhile and haven't noticed any complications with the battery or anything yet. I am very happy with this purchase!
            "
"11","Exactly as described. Unlocked . Worked immediately in excellent condition. Battery is in prime condition.I believe the people that are reading negative reviews are using iPhones that they received from these guys to try and put their SIM card from Verizon or Sprint which are still pulling from cdma based networks which is why it's not going to workThe phone is GSM unlocked not factory unlocked there is a big difference the sooner people educate themselves on the difference the better off our society will be
            "
"12","Phone worked only for 1day and then it started acting up. It was stuck on the apple logo and it kept going off and on. Please don¡¯t trust these product. On top of that I had to pay additional $10 to return it.
            "
"13","This phone looks and performs like it's brand new. Not one scratch. The phone came with a screen protector and a charger. I was surprised as other reviews said they did not get one. For $269, I feel like this was a steal, compared to other listings. Hopefully nothing goes wrong with the phone later. But with the Amazon 90 day guarantee I'm a little more at ease. Never bought a refurbished phone before. Not sure what to expect. As far as my order, I am happy with it.
            "
"14","I actually never write reviews. I am a business owner and I know what it feels like to have a bad review posted. That being said I want to warn the consumer.I ordered the phone it being factory refurbished I new it was risky but, the savings was enough to consider. The phone worked for a total of two days. Then began to shut of and continue restarting and then saying on for about 1 second and shutting down again. I then had to go a verizon store and just get a phone because I needed a phone by that time...Hear is the biggest hassle to return the phone you have to take Iphone cloud off. I couldn't do that because my phone wouldn't turn on. I called them and they sent me a link. I had to login and switch the phone to no longer in use. For most people that may not be a problem. I'm not very tech savy so again it was just more of a hassle.The company did have amazing customer service they picked up right away. That why this isn't a 1 star. They also had an easy solution to turning the Iphone  cloud off.
            "
"15","The phone came with a case and a screen protector..the phone is perfect its new theres no scratches no cracks way better than expected
            "
"16","Purchased this refurbished phone to replace my Iphone 6, only to have it freeze up every few seconds using it.  Had to hit sleep button, resign in, and continue what I was doing, but this happened way to much and found extremely annoying.  I was unable to return it, because I waiting to long to activate it.  So, I had the front screen replaced, and everything worked fine.  I agree with other people, that if you are selling refurbished products, it should be fully tested, before selling for over $400.  Very annoying.
            "
"17","The device stopped working after less than three week. I tried to contact the seller and was unable to get any substantial communication. I had hardware issues that I was unable to have fixed right away because I was out of country. I had to pay Apple to replace the parts because they were not actually Apple parts. This is a purchase I truly regret making, I have been extremely disappointed!
            "
"18","First, seller did a great job and I think I got a good price for an iPhone 7, I just think ALL CELL PHONES are way way way too expensive. When a Cell phone costs more than a good laptop computer that is too expensive.  Second all Smart phones have horrible battery life.  Apple's iPhones are no exception.  There is a mode on the iPhone 7 to allow for an extended battery life setting.  But I see no difference between the extended setting and the normal setting.  I do not use my phone except for emergencies so I would expect the phone to last 5-6 days between charging, but I am averaging 3-4 days between charging.  I am having an issue that the WiFi doesn't see both of my wireless networks (dual band router). Seller tried to help but Apple's support said if it sees a network that's all they care about.  Phone appears to be working fine and so far I am happy with it.
            "
"19","Excellent phone! Not even a scratch on it! Only drawback is that,it has come without a box and earphones or a connector and an original iPhone charger!
            "
"20","This iPhone 7 matte black was a good purchase for me because my old phone was slow and battery would run out fast but with this iPhone it seems to last me the whole day of usage without charging it back but theres two problems first the fingerprint doesn¡¯t work so good it took me a while to set up because it would say an error and second of all when I wanted to put it to charge, it wouldn¡¯t charge unless I fixed its position but overall I can fix those miner problems and it was worth it.
            "
"21","Be cautious, this says Apple is the seller but once you purchase it will update the ""sold by"" line to a third-party seller (mine was called MyWit). That means you're not covered by Apple protections on a refurbished device. The phone I got didn't have it's battery replaced in the refurbishment. I had Apple run a test within a month of purchase and they said it definitely needed to be replaced (battery drained to 25% after using it for 3 hours) and it would cost $30 for a new battery (I eventually talked Apple out of this once they realized how I had been mislead, and how the refurbishment was done poorly). When I contacted MyWit for a replacement, they said they don't do replacements, but I could return the phone and buy a new one. Seems reasonable, except that the price was fluctuating every day and had increased between $20-$60 since I had purchased it.The phone works OK now that I got Apple to fix it, but just be aware this isn't actually Apple selling it, so it's a riskier buy. Go to Apple.com and look at their refurbished devices if you want to be sure your phone was properly refurbished.
            "
"22","Overall a great product. Came in almost perfect condition with a glass screen protector already on it. I did have to get the battery replaced, no big deal. Shortly after the battery was replaced the camera and flashlight stopped working. Apparently this is an issue with the iPhone 7s in general (that's a risk you take when buying a refurbished phone)... I was able to get it replaced as well though and I have a perfect working phone.
            "
"23","My 32 GB 6 got knocked over by a 3 year old the other day and some wonky pixel lines messed up my screen, so that I couldn't even unlock it.  I got this 128 GB Black 7, and now I have tons of room.  It looks and feels brand new, charged like a champ, battery life has been great, camera is wonderful even using my iphone 6 case.  I could not be happier.  Seriously, I'm dancing around about this purchase!
            "
"24","Buenas tardes... pense que el celular era nuevo, ya que me vino rallado y sin la caja original, me parece un total abuso y hasta estaria dispuesto a devolverlo, son una estafa total! pido la devolucion de mi dinero
            "
"25","Phone WAS NOT unlocked when it arrived. Was still locked by AT&T. Had to call Apple Care and AT&T before I could get the phone unlocked and operational.
            "
"26","I can¡¯t even use the phone because it won¡¯t read any SIM cards... can¡¯t make calls or text anyone and can¡¯t use data. Super irritated and probably will never do this again. I¡¯m returning my today.
            "
"27","The phone came with its own screen saver and had no cracks on it. Was worried about getting a broken one like some of the reviews, but it works (for now anyway). But there¡¯s a camera shutter sound whenever I take a picture (iPhone camera, Snapchat, instagram, etc). I looked online and they said that phones in other countries have it illegal to have the shutter noise on silent (but in the US it isn¡¯t like that), so if anyone knows how to silence that it will be great. Everything else on the phone is fantastic!
            "
"28","I bought this phone for my mother and she loves it. It was in great condition and functioning great! Also came with a tempered glass cover on it «Ã
            "
"29","The phone was shipped on time, looked great and functioned correctly.  However, it was not unlocked and I am unable to get my current carrier (AT&T) to unlock it so I can switch carriers.  I now have to call the other major carriers to see if I can convince them to do it or just purchase another phone that is for the carrier that I want to switch too.  Ultra frustrating.
            "
"30","There are too many problems. The earphone was not heard from left side. Also when I call, I can hear the other person's voice, but other person can't hear my voice. The problem is serious <U+0001F621>
            "
"31","Be careful ordering from this seller. Do not buy. When I received the phone, I went to turn it on at the boost mobile store and he was able to give me a new sim card, (which I paid for) and a number. The boost mobile store guy then told me it was not picking up a signal and he tried updating the phone, and it did not work. He told me that it was a known iphone 7 problem, and I had to go to the apple store. I went to the apple store who first told me they would send the phone out (to I am guessing apples corporation because they could not fix it in the store) and give me a phone to use until I get mine back. Another lady then came to me and said since the phone was refurbished that they would send it out but the corporation would just send it back unfixed because it is refurbished, so they gave me another option to trade my iphone 7 in to them since it is in perfect condition and it is worth $250 off of whatever phone I buy from them. I then looked up the ¡°problem¡± the iphone 7¡¯s are having, and it says some iphone 7¡¯s Apple has determined that a small percentage of iPhone 7 devices may show ""No Service"" in the status bar (even if cellular coverage is available), due to a component that has failed on the main logic board, the seller also lied and said thathe checked everything to see if it works, which he lied he knew it would be like this. Now I am going through all this trouble teying to figure out what to do, so beware you will be waisting your money, and time.
            "
"32","I am totally unsatisfied with the bought. The iPhone is defective and I tried to return the item but Amazon informed I have to pay to do that and this is extremelly expensive here from Brasil. I would also like to be able to return the product but without having to for very expensive mail rates in Brazil.  I wish I had not made the purchase.
            "
"33","I have to return it.  Not fully unlocked.  I couldn't connect it to Tmobile.  We wasted  a day going to Tmobile and then Apple store.  No one was able to help us.  They said couldn't connect to network.  VERY, VERY unhappy.
            "
"34","So the iPhone itself on the outside was good looking. Small scratch on the bottom of the screen. Software seemed to work okay but I only had it a few hours before I decided to return it. This is why: I went to test out the camera and it couldn't focus on something even when I tapped on the screen to tell it what to focus on. The screen when using the camera ""jiggled"" and my husband pointed out the clicking sound coming from the hardware of the device. Then I noticed the camera was shaking! Then we couldn't hold the phone because it overheated! So yeah it got sent back. True review with no lies.
            "
"35","I have gotten a Japanese or Korean phone and I¡¯m in the states. My camera shutter sound will not turn off because it¡¯s illegal there to have the shutter sound off.  The phone will not stop glitching and crashes a lot. It looked like it was in great condition but it was not.
            "
"36","I was extremely excited to get my iPhone 7, but it turned out to be a very frustrating situation. I went through the process to start up the phone and get to the home screen. The first thing I tried was to put my SIM card into the phone, but it didn¡¯t work. It searched for minutes only to say ¡°No Service¡±. Then I tried using the camera app, but it glitched out every time I attempted to take a photo or record a video. I looked up the problem and the articles said to check Voice Memos to see if you get ¡°Recording Failed - No audio devices found.¡± <U+2014> unfortunately, I had this problem. The only good aspect to this phone was its look, nothing else. Overall, the phone is broke and unusable. I bought my phone from ElectroWireless; they ripped me off completely. I expected a working phone from the description, but instead I was shipped an exact opposite of it. I am very upset.
            "
"37","The phone(iPhone7 - 256GB - black) came with a fried modem. Within 24 hours an alert saying ¡°Carrier Update Failed¡± popped up. After that I had no bars, instead it was replaced with ¡°No Service¡± and a warning icon.Besides the defective internals, The outer casing and glass were in good condition. Only minor nicks in the aluminum from the previous owners case.I¡¯m currently sending the phone to Apple for the iPhone ¡°No Service¡± repair program, as it is still eligible.
            "
"38","I purchased an Unlocked silver 32GB iPhone 7. Phone appears to be in great condition. However I received a rose gold phone that is not GSM unlocked.Please advise.  I really need to have this phone unlocked.
            "
"39","I bought this phone and within 6 weeks, the motem had totally failed, which prevented me from getting any service at all. I bought the same phone again through this listing but from a different vendor and had the same result. Just spend the extra money to get a brand new phone. These refurbished phones aren't reliable.

"40","from ecuador I bought an iphone 7 128gb and my daughter brought it to me and when I tried to use it I realized that the headset did not work and the speaker option was also inactive .. I took it to a technical center and they told me that they would have to check it his repair would cost between $ 50 - $ 120, so I do not know how to proceed since it is the first time this happens to me
            "
"41","Product worked fine for first two months and whenI travelled abroad it did not last more than two days. By the time I returned from abroad, the return window period closed. The screen keeps suggesting to connect to iTunes and when I did it tries to restore but fails repeatedly, does not go any further. Being unable to contact the seller, had to use to my old iPhone. This was my first refurbished iPhone I bought and wouldn¡¯t suggest buying one anymore.
            "
"42","After having this phone for 61days the phone started freezing up , force closing and the back camera stopped working (it was just black , no image would show when you pull up the back camera) and the flashlight stopped working . Not happy with this phone at all . This didn¡¯t even last me 3 full month so it was definitely not worth the money <U+0001F616><U+0001F616>
            "
"43","I got this phone back in March after my old one was stolen. It was decently priced and I was desperate. It worked great, looked and felt brand new, I had no problems connecting it with my carrier! After about 6 months, it started to freak out and restart all the time. My apple ID no longer would work so my imessages were turned off, I couldn¡¯t facetime. It was a nightmare! Also when I would barely put it down on a table the screen would freak out and it was restart again. Sometimes I would have to forse wake it. The people at the Apple Store told me that there was something wrong with the hardware and that many certified refurbished phones have had their hardware touched or messed with during the refurbishing process. I ended up getting a brand new phone about 8 months after I purchased this one. Bottom line, don¡¯t buy this phone if you want it for a long period of time it will have so many problems in the long run and it¡¯s more worth it to spend the money on a new phone.
            "
"44","I ended up searching on Amazon for the iPhone 7 after my original was non functional and two of the replacement phones the AT&T insurance vendor sent were also individually non-functional not to mention they only had black when I originally had a silver/white that matched my case. They sent me a check to find my own and so I got a refurb here in my desired color.Everything is pretty much equivalent to my original phone in wear and tear (minor scratches and dings) aside from the fact that the screen lifts on the bottom left a little and I feel it may be effecting the touch screen efficiency.I was also surprised to find it had a screen cover already on it when I received it which I bought separately with the phone not expecting that bonus! So I was very pleased.I also received a charging block and cable with the phone.
            "
"45","Purchased is item based on the Amazon reviews. Extremely unhappy with the purchase and the item is not as described. Below are the issues I faced on this refurbished phone.1) When making and receiving calls hear alot of noise ( like raining on the other side and birds chip sound). It took some time to realize from where that sound is coming, tried calling multiple numbers and its the same everytime.2) Phone gets over heated and felt like its going to blow up. Very scary.3) Noticed battery drops from 92% to 76% with a single call which lasted for 5 min. Definitely not a good battery, could be fake.4) Noticed call drops and ""No Service"" while on the phone. Weird, had to do sim in and out. Seems like the SIM card tray is not firm.5) The speakers on the phone are not functioning as it supposed to be, very distorted sound.Very unhappy with the purchase
            "
"46","Very satisfied with my refurbished iPhone 7, been using it from like 3 weeks and everything looking and working fine, its looks like its almost new and came in a really good package and a screen protector (tempered glass) to protect it, it also came with USB lightning cable and a wall adapter, the only thing I did not like about this seller (and I¡¯m not really sure if is he's fault), is that it came without invoice, but I know that happens sometimes so, its not a big deal.
            "
"47","It¡¯s a great product, I am really happy with my brand new iPhone. It¡¯s was good deal. I highly recommend PRIVI. Thank you so much and God bless you!!

"48","This phone looks new and the battery is phenomenal. Popped in my T Mobile sim and it was ready to rock and roll. Everything about this phone has been as expected EXCEPT the screen. Sometimes it works perfectly, but about half the time it does not. It doesn¡¯t recognize the correct location where touching the screen. For example, I¡¯ll try typing a word but it¡¯ll recognize keystrokes from the other side of the keyboard. If I lock and unlock the screen a few times it will act normally.  I cannot find out how to reach their tech support.
            "
"49","So far, I LOVE this phone. Looks like new, everything works as it should, battery holds its charge great. No issues whatsoever. Even the clerk as TMobile commented on what a great phone it is, and at such a terrific price.
            "
"50","I was nervous upon buying this however it did not disappoint. The phone was in perfect condition, however did not come with the original charger. There was no damage, works perfectly and doesn¡¯t seem to have any functioning issues.
            "
"51","Phone seems to work well and is fast. Arrived looking great. The battery how ever is bad. Per the phones battery health the battery is degraded and will not hold a charge. I can not even use it for an hour.
            "
"52","I bought this from BuySpry In September 2018. The battery was just 1% higher than the cut off limit for the free battery replacement from Apple, until the first week of 2019 (when the battery replacement wouldn¡¯t be free anymore). Now (April 2019), it¡¯s at 75% max capacity and doesn¡¯t last for long after just casual use.It arrived with a little chip out of the side near the volume buttons. It¡¯s just cosmetic but it still irks me.The screen is also starting to mess up. It doesn¡¯t always sense when I swipe across the screen to answer a call or when I type.So now I¡¯m going to be down another $50 at least to get another digitizer and battery.I gave it 3 stars for value for money because I¡¯m still not sure if it would¡¯ve been easier and cheaper in the long run to just buy new.
            "
"53","Overall, this was a great phone and a nice purchase. It did come two days late, but it wasn¡¯t a major issue for me. The phone came well packaged and was not damaged. However, there are a few white specks on the back of the phone that I can¡¯t remove and there is also a small scratch on the screen, but nothing too bad. It works perfectly fine and is pretty fast. It is also ¡°GSM unlocked¡±, which Verizon said wouldn¡¯t work with their carriers. But I tried the SIM card anyways, and it actually worked. So overall, I¡¯m really pleased with this purchase.
            "
"54","Seems to work well. I¡¯m enjoying a battery that lasts overnight and apps that don¡¯t crash every time they open (like my poor older phone). Overall, seems to be a good product so far. A couple minor dings on the corners of the phone but it came with a screen protector which is great. My only other complaint is that it has trouble with my parents¡¯ WiFi, but they don¡¯t have the fastest internet to start. And of course I hate that it doesn¡¯t have a headphone jack (but that¡¯s an iPhone thing not an amazon thing).
            "
"55","Saved up for months and months to purchase this, when I received it, the camera was completely broken. The exterior looked strange and it refused to take any pictures. The lens would shake and shake and it would show a blue screen but the rest of the phone was functional.
            "
"56","The phone was in perfect shape. But it did not work with my Xfinity account (uses Verizon network). Too bad. Nice phone. They did a quick refund, about a days turnaround. Pretty incredible.
            "
"57","This is a recurring experience to me !!!. The price was very attractive but you know every cheap thing always comes with a hidden cost.  The iPhone worked only 14 hours !!!, and then it suddenly turned off without any warning. Since then it never worked again. Taking into consideration that the seller was a certified seller, I went to an apple store to get it fixed cause seller said the mobile phone came with 90 days of warranty. Apple store guys told me ""this phone was sold damaged by us and also sold AS IS !!! we can't believe this seller did not warn the buyer about the phone condition."" I say it is a recurring experience cause in many times ""certified sellers"" are not as certified as the must be. Apple store was located in Boston (Boylston). Finally time wasted for nothing !!.
            "
"58","Wi-fi button doesn't work, so you can't connect to wi-fi even after restarting the phone, battery shows different digits every minute from charged 80% to 5% in just a minute. The phone would turn off and on by itself. After purchasing this item I sent it back and got a refund. Although after about a month my card was charged 130$ from Amazon and I didn't make this purchase. This phone was the only item I used the card for this website. So yeah terrible phone and possible fraud on the card from this account.
            "
"59","I think this is a knock-off item. On the back of the phone, it has the words ¡°iPhone product¡±. It¡¯s not a real iPhone.Also, it did not come with the earbuds and lightening jack connector as advertised. These we will end up needing to buy separately. It works, but it¡¯s pricey for basically a fake iPhone.
            "
"60","This is my second iPhone purchase from amazon but first from this seller and I am very happy! It actually came a day earlier than promised which is awesome! It has two TINY scratches on the back but you really cannot see them so it looks and works as a brand new phone! Thank you!
            "
"61","I just received my product today. Comes with a screen protector and lookes like new. I see no scratches or dents etc. I too was skeptical about this product for being 290$. So far works perfectly I just popped in my SIM card and it worked right away. I highly recommend buying this!

"62","My iPhone 6 took a swim and I didn't want to $700 -$1000 for a new phone.  This phone works great, I just transferred my AT&T sim card and updated via iCloud.  The iPhone 7 and above are ""waterproof"".  It's the same size as the iPhone 6.
            "
"63","Bought this as a gift for mothers day. Was going to be first iPhone, so I didn't really care if it was somewhat slow and the battery didn't work as good. Well, after I received it, I checked it out myself and I was impressed and satisfied with what I was looking at. The touch, speakers, battery and screen were in great condition. I do wish they would just wipe down the phone and clean it before sending it out though.
            "
"64","Very unhappy about my purchase the phones are supposed to be unlocked so you can program them and they are not I have to return it and with that I am out on the screen protectors as well

"65","So far so good.Bought refurbished iphone7 128gb from eKings.I received this product within a week. It came in a plain white box, it did come with brand new apple charger. The phone looks brand new. No scratches, the screen and back have a protective film on it which I appreciate. So far from what I have tried everything works. I did notice a little dust in the charger port and speaker area but that¡¯s no big deal. I did notice the phone got hot when I used an off brand charger.I will try to update this post in a month or two.

"66","OMG I finally got it! Now I know why kids will stand on line for iPhones for hours. After fooling around with Motorola smart phones for 9 years, none of which were particularly impressive or worked particularly well, I have finally come away from the darkside of cellular and into the light. This thing is great and it wasn't very hard to set up. The security on the phone is outstanding. I bought this iPhone 7 (256GB) for myself and the iPhone 7+ (128 GB) for my wife for less than $1K .  All my kids, and grandkids told me that the iPhone 7, with loads of memory, and an upgrade to the IOS 11 operating system was the way to go. They were right. These phones are an outstanding value.
            "
"67","My son purchased this phone because he broke his phone. The phone was not charged at all, and the charger they sent with it was not an apple accessory; it would not charge the phone. I had to charge it with my charger before I could do anything. It just seemed like a very cheaply done refurbish. Won¡¯t purchase from them again. It was still expensive and should have come with the proper charging equipment.
            "
"68","The phone is in very good condition, the carcass did not have any type of scratch, mark of blow or damage; the touch screen works without problems; the quality of the audio is very good when making calls; Apple's own functionalities work without problems. It includes a generic charger and does not include headphones
            "
"69","This is working out perfectly so far... great condition, great battery life so far... the only thing I didn't expect was the glass protection screen already on it... it made the cover I got for it a little difficult to install. Other than that... very happy so far with it.
            "
"70","Ok after a month of use I can say the phone is like brand new for $400 (what a bargain). Got the phone in a nice box with a charger, cable and an Amazon renewed booklet. I'm using the phone outside of the US without any issue.
            "
"71","Very bad, recive with scratches!
            "
"72","Prompt shipping. Phone looks brand new. Works great, but it has only been a couple of days. The battery is only 84%, but that is to be expected on a refurbished phone, and can be easily replaced in the future. All good so far! 100% happy.
            "
"73","I got what I paid for. An iPhone refurbished, working and rolling. Only minor scratches (like one small). I haven't fully see how battery life will be, but seems okay. I bought it from Quick Deals CR (with Prime). If you want an iPhone, plus the benefits when buying from Amazon, I think it's a good deal.
            "
"74","Do not buy this phone, there is no way it¡¯s certifiedI am now 3 weeks after my return window and the phone stopped workingI took it to get fixed and they said it¡¯s under no warranty as it was just mashed up from different parts
            "
"75","Phone arrived in prestine condition, with a new charger to boot; HOWEVER it is defective. My phone doesn¡¯t pick up signal from any SIM card that is inserted. It is a known issue for iPhone 7¡¯s that start with Serial # A1660. My iPhone starts with that serial number and because I¡¯m not the original purchaser Apple is charging me $300 to fix the issue. Fix this.
            "
"76","So far, this phone has been working as expected. No disappointments
            "
"77","I even do not want to give a star. This product is a garbage. It keeps turning on and off by itself. I can¡¯t even use a minute. The seller is trying to cheat on us. Be careful. Evil.
            "
"78","Upgraded from the 5s. Love my new phone. Looks like new !!!! The battery life is DECENT but that¡¯s not a problem considering I¡¯m not the type of person who is constantly using their phone. Didn¡¯t come with case and screen protector btw
            "
"79","I¡¯ve had this phone for less than a year. I¡¯d love to return but they won¡¯t let me ( of course). And within 6 months the vibrate features became very aggressive. I¡¯m told I was sold a phone with a faulty Taptic Engine as well as an often unresponsive touch screen. I¡¯d like to buy a newer iPhone but I can¡¯t sell it to anyone bc I can¡¯t justify f***ing anyone over with a phone that is ¡°operational but still broken¡±
            "
"80","Muy bueno
            "
"81","Like a new phone without the price
            "
"82","This company needs to be closely watched because I made a purchase and they said the phone was fully unlocked but it was not I want to AT&T to try and get it unlocked and the Apple store and they told me to send it back to where I get it from it was no good they could possibly unlock it but it will cost me an extra $300 to have it unlocked they are charging me to ship it back to them when in the fluid off the phone was locked
            "
"83","Phone arrived on time and included a charger. I had to revise this review after a few days of receiving the phone. Everything was fine. The phone worked and got service. I absolutely loved it. However, the phone randomly stopped working with Verizon. I couldn't send/receive text messages or phone calls and it wouldn't even connect to wifi. I had no way of contacting anyone and I had to be somewhere that night. It was beyond frustrating. I went to Verizon to hopefully fix the issue, but the IMEI number on the phone was not even legit and they could not do anything. Spend the extra money to get a real iPhone from Apple or a trusted friend. It is not worth the hassle, trust me.
            "
"84","The phone it¡¯s selfnis alright, the charger I received with the phone has stopped working all together. I take good care of my things so I know it¡¯s not me. I received my phone at the end of October. It is December 6th and my charger isn¡¯t working. That is a problem. Now I can¡¯t even charge my phone anymore.
            "
"85","Phone is awesome. When you're on a call the volume is low could barely hear  so we switch to speaker. But over all the phone is great ot looks great no other problems i will be buying again in the very near future.
            "
"86","My package came on time and the iphone 7 looked new. There were no scratches or marks on it. it's unlocked so no bundled apps to bog down the system. It works great with T-mobile. I paid 1/2 of what i would have paid if i went to the A Store. It has the larges memory and the best price and functions well so far.
            "
"87","nothing but problems since I bought it, mic sometimes doesn't work the camera sometimes doesn't work,took it in to have it fix and a was told that it was falling apart inside missing screws every where.and that  I have to replaced the charging port too, was having trouble charging it.
            "
"88","Apple iPhone 7, with a three month warranty.  within two months of purchase we began having issues with this phone.  A week ago the phone completely locked up and shows nothing but the apple sign when powered on.  I have contacted the seller twice through recommended email and I still haven¡¯t received a reply.  Completely dissatisfied with this purchase. <U+0001F44E><U+0001F3FC>
            "
"89","Overall the phone is great especially for the price. It¡¯s Friday April 26th, 2019 and I¡¯ve had my phone for a week now. I read a lot of comments about not being a bale to use the phone due to network problems, but mine worked perfectly. I¡¯m with cricket who¡¯s also owned by AT&T and literally all I did was switched SIM cards and the phone worked. I had an android and did the switch and had to save contacts and other information, but it¡¯s a great purchase
            "
"90","The phone is not unlocked. The battery life is zero. So upset cos Ispent so much time now need to look for another phone.
            "
"91","the first few days the phone was working real fine and when it came to the 3rd day the service went out and i went to tmobile and they said its been reported stolen. Then the day after the charger won't fit all of a sudden and also the screen would randomly go black. I hope i get my money back for all this.
            "
"92","My phone works great, I have had it for over an year now. The only problem is once when an Apple software update had a glitch and my phone started rebooting continuously, and I couldn¡¯t rely on Apple¡¯s Genius services to solve it. But I guess that is the only downside.
            "
"93","We have been using the phone for about a month now -- ZERO ISSUES!  Arrived in perfect shape.  No scratches at all.  Unlocked and works great in Germany.  Arrives in plain box with charger plug and usb charger.  Highly recommend refurb over new.  Great value.
            "
"94","The phone is in good condition but it¡¯s not unlocked like it says. I live in a remote area that only gets service from certain carriers and since i¡¯ve been lied to, ive been struggling to even activate this iphone.
            "
"95","I don't usually give five stars on any of my reviews so this item is a rarity.  Phone worked perfectly on GSM T-Mobile.  Just inserted the SIM and added Apple account and the phone hasn't given me any issues after about six weeks of heavy use.  The phone had absolutely zero blemishes or any type of damage.  Absolutely no scuffing of housing or scratches on screen.  It looked brand new.  Sorry no pictures.  Very happy with this purchase and will be looking at buying another from this seller.  Hopefully it'll be in similar conditions.
            "
"96","I was afraid to get this phone when I read the reviews but I took a chance. I am not disappointed. It looks brand new and everything works great.
            "
"97","el telefono me funcono bien 10 dias . Luego estuvo con la posibilidad de comunicarme por wp pero no pude recibir no realizar llamadas.El departamento tecnico de apple diagnostico falla del rutter.He resulto devolverlo en mas o menos un mes que estare en Miami para poder enviar por correo seguro  el aparato dado que desde Uruguay me parece menos seguro.Agradezco a Amazon la rapida respuesta y la aceptacion de mi reclamo y el reemboslo del dinero.
            "
"98","I purchased this phone, and it came with a supervision profile installed, which allows someone to monitor my internet usage and location.  The top of the phone says ¡°This device is supervised by TEST¡±.  This is not acceptable.  If this cannot be removed, I will need to return the phone.
            "
"99","Phone keeps disconnecting from cellular service. Apple claims this is normal for this model and it needs to be repaired. If the refurbishing replaced any of the internals this will cost $319.
            "
"100","I brought this as an early Christmas gift for my husband. This phone came earlier than the estimated shipping. I also think the cost was inexpensive. The condition was great, no complaints from either one of us. My husband loves his phone and now on team Apple. I will definitely be purchasing again when it¡¯s time for an upgrade
            "
"101","Battery was at 100%. There were no scratches or marks on the phone at all. Came with a screen protector already in place and generic charger. Unfortunately it would not work with my carrier which is a GSM carrier. Had service for about an hour before it cut off and never came back. My carrier didn¡¯t know what was wrong with it either.
            "
"102","Extremely affordable price especially for 2 of the 128GB memory storage, ilmy sister was just going to buy me one as a gift but when I noticed the price for 2 she said that was a deal and may not find it anywhere else.When the phones arrived they were very well packaged and even included a small tool to be able to open the SIM card location that was a plus and thoughtful add.Recommend this sell for everyone.
            "
"103","Bought this device for my mother-in-law's birthday. Everything looked fine, however, the audio was damaged and came through muffled. I returned the device for a replacement and after almost two weeks have not received it. Not worth the headache. Get your refurbished devices directly from Amazon or Apple and save yourself the trouble.
            "
"104","I received the phone quickly and it was in good condition, looks like a brand new phone and worked perfect. About a week maybe two weeks later the microphone completely stopped working; couldn¡¯t talk on the phone or speak to text or record videos. Tried everything to fix it myself, eventually calling Apple for them to tell me that this is a common issue  with the iPhone 7 and the only way to fix it was to make an appointment at the Apple Store which for me is almost 2 hours away.  So just beware of any iPhone 7, not from this seller in particular but I would just get a 6S they are just as good actually better because I¡¯ve had no issues with my 6.
            "
"105","First off I¡¯d like to say the phone was perfect. Everything was perfect. It was the color I wanted, the size I wanted, it all worked great. I even activated it with my phone carrier. It worked for a few minutes, connected and all. I even bought my fiance a phone and activated his (from a different seller). I tried to order a car service and realized that I didn¡¯t have service. It started searching and kept saying no service. I took it back to my carrier and they took a look at it again and apparently this is a problem of yours. The phone constantly shuts off on me and it won¡¯t connect to any SIM card. I¡¯m getting my money back. *annoyed*
            "
"106","Phone in great shape and works well.
            "
"107","Item as described.  thank you but in 15 days o have problem. But in waranty Apple has chance a iPhone
            "
"108","Great seller, excellent phone (iPhone 7 32gb), I am more than satisfied, can trust, honest seller and fulfilled all the described!
            "
"109","Best iPhone I have owned to date.  The iPhone 7 does everything I want it to do, and it does it fast and has a great battery life.I don't see myself upgrading phones anytime soon!
            "
"110","The phone came in near-perfect condition. The only sign of use was a little ware around the Apple logo and some signs that it was in a case, but I couldn¡¯t have asked for a better phone. Works perfectly. A huge thank you to the seller.
            "
"111","Item was defective. Sent it back for repair and they sent it back with the same issues. When I contacted them again they told me to take it to Apple. Apple was unable to repair the phone and told me my only option was a new phone. Comtacted the third party company selling on Amazon again and they told me they would fix it for a fee but a refund Or replacement was not an option. What good is their warranty if they won't replace a phone they can't fix.
            "
"112","Love this cell phone! Works perfect! No problems! Love Love Love!!!
            "
"113","I needed a phone that works with Metro PCS,As soon as I open the box and saw the model # and  a label that said Verizon, I knew it was the wrong item.The description says that it will work with T mobile which is the same network.Very disappointed, will return tomorrow.
            "
"114","I  originally bought this phone to upgrade from my old 5S I absolutely love it!  However I am not able to use it with Verizon  as the description states!  Was hoping I would be able to because some of the other reviews  said that it would work with Verizon but,  mine doesn't  also it would be  Smart to pay attention to the seller.  I bought mine from dealFisher.  The reason I'm not going to return this is 1 because  i'm absolutely in love with the phone .  The camera is awesome and the sound is awesome.  And 2  because I already bought a phone case for it. Every gigabyte I ordered is on there  and the phone was exactly as described. So,  I guess I'll use this phone for Facebook  and use my old 5S as just a phone.  I would suggest if you're on Verizon don't buy this phone  unless you're using it for social media and things of that nature.  If anything changes I'll come back and update this review.
            "
"115","I was so lucky  actually I bought the iPhone eight  i¡¯m really happy it¡¯s a wonderful phone I¡¯m really really happy, Excellent price
            "
"116","The seller should inform buyers of the product's Incompatibility with the largest U.S. carrier.  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband.  We tried to set it up on our Verizon account on Christmas morning and could not.  The Verizon representative told us that the phone is not compatible with their network (although the model is, the particular phone is not).  Very disappointed.
            "
"117","I like the phone but the only problem I have is that the camera¡¯s shutter sound will not turn off. I silenced the phone and even that didn¡¯t work. It¡¯s still a great phone
            "
"118","Phone came with screen damage. You could not type or slide to answer a call. The screen would randomly zoom and freeze. The screen was non-responsive most of the time. Also came with a lot of chips in it.
            "
"119","This phone is one of the models of that have ""no service"" issues.  Buy from different seller or have many issues with your phone.
            "
"120","I¡¯ve bought two of these one for myself one for my fiance. Hers completely died about two weeks ago. Took it to my electronic repair guy and we tested the whole phone and it had no power no matter what we did. Now mine continuously gives me a cellular data error and from what I¡¯ve researched means that the cellular signal receiver is dead.
            "
"121","Excellent and much less expensive than it would have been from the T Mobile store!
            "
"122","I bricked my Iphone 7. I needed a cheap replacement. I didnt want to spend big amounts of money to have a new phone that lets face it, we will change it in a year. I coudnt care less for physical defects. I went for this one. For now it has been working properly. Everything functional. I restored it, updated it, and it works well.
            "
"123","Working well for more than 6 months. Works as new. I like it because of built in memory space.
            "
"124","I am really very dissatisfied with this product. Firstly, I haven't received any accessories like earphones, cable, adapter and also ear phones connector. Mainly the volume button isn't working and the ring is not working when someone calls I can only feel the vibration. I don't know why is this happening.
            "
"125","Product not as described. Was not unlocked.  After calling customer service they stated if your not buying from a computer you won¡¯t get the full details. Who uses a computer these days?  So they sell half detailed products on amazon mobile sending out wrong products to customers.  Don¡¯t buy.
            "
"126","Came out defective, after sending it to the facility to get fixed they sent it back still defective and didn¡¯t reimburse my money. Wouldn¡¯t recommend.
            "
"127","Phone is clean and like new kinda blew my expectations good job guys <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FE><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FE>
            "
"128","Don't waste your money. While completing the initial set up the iPhone locked up. All resets as instructed by customer service were attempted with no result. They then advised to return. Only issued a 50% return because the phone was returned locked (which was the reason for the return). The other 50% is the ""restocking"" charge.
            "
"129","Received wat expected
            "
"130","The phone worked ok for a while, now it has interference and cutting out issues when talking on it. Texting worked fine at first but some seemed to be delayed how but I'm not sure if that's the phone or the provider.
            "
"131","Good quality smartphone. I am very happy with the purchase.
            "
"132","The Iphone itself was in perfect condition. The reason why I give 3 stars is due to batter. I received it with a 92% battery condition. However 2 days later it decreased to 88 and 2 more days later to 86. Battery wouldn¡¯t last more than 4 hours.Solution to this, i had to go to apple and replace the battery. For 50 USD they get you a new battery and the iphone works like Brand New. I really recommend this solution if you go through the same problem. However, it involves spending 50 more bucks which is annoying.
            "
"133","States that the phone is unlocked.Took the phone to Verizon, they stated that the phone is not unlocked. Therefore making the phone unusable. I filed for a refund and sent it back.
            "
"134","New but great so far! Perfect condition, good battery, works well.
            "
"135","The phone is perfect guys I really love it,  but next time add the lil' pin to remove the SIM card in the box as well , I wanted to u give 6 stars but Amazon only allows 5 , lol
            "
"136","Good phone came packaged very nicely.  Charged and performed as expected.  Love the new features of the 7 especially the translation and text of voicemails so cool!  A few dings on the corners but they are covered by case anyway.  Love my phone and did not have to call tech support I set up up myself.  Love it!
            "
"137","The phone is exactly as advertised.  It was unlocked, compatible with AT&T, in good physical condition, and fully operational.  It appears that the touch screen MIGHT have been replaced with something other than original manufacturer specification parts.  But it works just fine, and does everything I want.
            "
"138","it seems to have a few qwerks about it. Plus, I would have assumed a refurbished phone would have better battery life. The battery health is at 81%. When you buy a refurbished phone for nearly $400, you would expect the battery health to at least be 90%.
            "
"139","Cosmetically the phoe is in very good condition and looks new. It works just fine like a brand new phone !
            "

"141","This device was a lemon<U+0001F61E>. Battery lasts less than 8 hours with minimal use and audio hardware stopped working within 2 weeks. I had already thrown away the box so I couldn¡¯t return it. What a huge bummer.
            "
"142","Just got it today. Charger isn¡¯t great but works okay if you leave it alone. Only legit iffy thing is I can¡¯t turn the camera shutter off, even if it¡¯s on silent. Only phones from Asian countries require the camera shutter sound to always be on. Will see how the next few days go and will update.EDIT: It has been a week and the camera shutter sound is bothering me. How can i remove the noise?

"156","So when I recieved this phone it worked greato, but after a few days I kept losing phone service. This happened twice. I finally took it to the Apple store. Come to find out there is a free repair for the problem I was having. It does take 7-10 business days for it to get sent off, but it's a very common problem and Apple will either fix the problem or send you a brand new phone. This phone IS a VERIZON refurbished phone.
            "
"157","The phone I got was in ok condition. A few scratches here and there and one big one one the front of the screen right in the middle where u see it pretty much all the time. The battery healt is at 88%. Other than that I still consider the refurbished phone a pretty good value.
            "
"158","The phone arrived without a microphone to talk into, so calls were unable to be made. Despite the era of texting, the simple act of making a call was not refurbished. I would have thought that would have been tested for before selling.
            "
"159","This phone makes me hate IPhones all together. It shut downs all the time and I loose service half the time, mid call, mid task or all by itself.
            "
"160","Battery life has been good, that was a big one I worried about. The phone came in great condition and I have been very happy with this purchase.
            "
"161","We liked it very much.  It was for my husband.  He has more features than mine like WiFi calling.  The thing we haven¡¯t liked is that the speaker acts up on it and it¡¯s hard to hear him sometimes.

"162","Perfect condition!
            "
"163","They sold me a lost phone. As soon as I activated it with my carrier I was locked out of it. It says ¡°No service¡± to where I couldn¡¯t make or receive calls or messages.

NOT. BUY. FROM. HERE!!!!!!
            "
"164","My ¡°refurbished¡± phone came with a large scratch on the glass screen!!!I would think that part of it being refurbished would have also included a CLEAN screen. Very poor judgment in thinking that it¡¯s ¡°refurbished¡±!

It was wrapped perfectly and upon opening there were no blemishes noticed on the phone.Set up went great and is working fine so far.I ordered two of these and both work great, delivery was fast, and product looks like new.I would recommend this company for the purchase.
            "
"166","Compre el telefono para enviarlo a Venezuela y resulta que alla el telefono no permite actualizacion en la compania telefonica me dicen que tengo que mandarlo de nuevo al comprador aun no se como resolverlo
            "
"167","Was not compatible with Verizon
            "
"168","We had this phone for 1day before it had problems.  It would only work intermittently.  Our carrier could not help.  We had to drive 30 min to the closest i phone store only to find that it needed a new ""logic board"".
            "
"169","I haven¡¯t had the phone turned on yet. From what I see everything seems to be fine.
            "
"170","The phone worked fine for 1 day..... All the sudden the screen kept flickering, turn off by itself, screen will freeze and call would suddenly drop.... Very disappointed and will never buy refurbished iPhone from Amazon..... And the return policy is awful, took too long get my money back...
            "
"171","Returning. Within a week of receiving it, the IPhone started shutting off by itself even though the battery was full. More importantly, the Iphone had ¡ì<U+00A0>No Service<U+00A0>¡í and a warning sign next to it, making any calls and texts impossible to go trough. Except that, the Iphone was working perfectly but I could not keep it because those bugs kept coming back.
            "
"172","I thought it was going to be an iPhone 8 but I got a 7 instead really wanted an 8 I have to use speakerphone to talk and not normal use i don¡¯t know what to do don¡¯t want to spend money on another phone
            "
"173","No issues, like new condition. Not a scratch on it. Camera and all features working well
            "
"174","Phone was received in great condition, no scratches or blemishes. Giving it two stars because it was not a true GSM unlocked phone and would not work with ATT so it¡¯s basically useless to me.
            "
"175","I took this device to an Apple Store thinking that it would still be covered under the extension program for the ""Cellular Update Failed"" notification only to find out that the device was actually already a replacement given to the previous customer under the program. As a result, Apple did not repair the device and I was stuck with a useless phone. Will be returning.
            "
"176","No funciona bien, no tenia ni el puntero para abrir donde va el chip, tire mi dinero
            "
"177","This product is NOT Apple certified! I received a refurbished phone with an after market screen. It had touch accuracy issues and the coloring was off. I took it to the Apple store and they highly recommended returning it. I won¡¯t buy phones from amazon again.
            "
"178","I don't usually write reviews but I just got my rose gold 7 yesterday so I don't know if it will act up or anything but so far everything is perfect. The battery life is so much better than my old android and everything is perfect, just a really small scratch on the screen but other than that everything is absolutely fine.
            "
"179","Was very clean and easy to set up. Haven¡¯t run to a single software or hardware problem and the touch sensitivity has failed or glitches at all; total upgrade from my previous iPhone 6!
            "
"180","I was very disappointed with my purchase. The phone was not unlocked and when I called AT&T for assistance, I found out the phone cannot be unlocked because the original owner did not pay off the phone.
            "
"181","My phone discharge very quickly I'm very sad
            "
"182","The phone was defective.  I needed to make an appointment with Apple & my phone was shipped off to get looked at & fixed....hardware problem.
            "
"183","The product came with a lot of scatchs, and isnt unlocked. This is vinculated with carrier, i have some problems to work in Brasil.Now, they stopped to work all carriers. I buyed an iphone and now i have an ipod.
            "
"184","We received this phone about 3-4 days ago. It¡¯s perfect. No scratches, issues thus far. They even sent a year warranty with the phone. It¡¯s my daughters phone as an upgrade from a 6. I have a 6s and have no complaints about my phone but am now jealous of hers. Will update if anything changes.
            "
"185","I dont live in the US and as soln as I brought it with me to my country I tried it and you are not able to hear when you phone someone or someone phones you. I can listen to the other person.Unfortunately it is complicated for me to do anything about it. I wont buy a  refurbished cell phone again. I dont recommend it.
            "
"186","This phone is a totally trash. The screen must be rebuilt so it is ""ghostly touch"", the keys pressed before your finger touchs the screen, and the touches are completely off too.  I could only go over the ""hello"" page but never be able to setup the region and language.  It is a shame the vendor put this on market and Amazon certified it is working as new!!
            "
"187","I had an issue with my iPhone and they were quick to solve it to my satisfaction
            "
"188","The thing that I don¡¯t like is the camera shutter sound. I¡¯ve tried different ways to silence it and nothing works.  Now I know it¡¯s a product made in Japan where it¡¯s illegal to not have a camera shutter sound. And there¡¯s no way of silencing it.
            "
"189","This was a really good phone! I bought it becuase my old one was broken and I didn't want to get a new one. Everything was perfect, except for when it arrived, there was a scratch at the top of the screen. It did not affect anything too much, so overall, the battery, touch screen, and everything else was perfect.
            "
"190","Touch screen to censative turns on when I put it in my pocket
            "
"191","The phone works well, has good battery life, and looks pretty clean. I've only had it for a couple months. So we'll see how it does for the next year or so.
            "
"192","The item was sold by ELECTRONIC DEALS and had multiple problems: microphone, backlight, usb port...overall the product looks as new, but it doesn't work as new. Screen was replaced with cheap 3rd party replacement kit by someones crooked hands. Disappointed, had to return the product.
            "
"193","Phone is in great physical shape, however, we need to take it to an apple store to have it looked over because it does not work for phone calls or texts unless you are on wifi.  Brought it to our verizon store and they said this model has a tendency to act this way???  So, we should take it to an apple store, nearest one is an hour away, and have them look at it.  So frustrating!!
            "
"194","Advertised to be unlocked. Did not work on Verizon network. Took a while to receive refund.
            "
"195","I bought this phone and I put my AT&T SIM card in. My SIM is working btw. So I put it in the new phone and it works for a little, then all of a sudden it goes to no service or searching. But it works fine when i put it in my old phone. Does anyone have this problem? Really don¡¯t feel like going to the hassle of returning.
            "
"196","Phone is in excellent shape, looks like brand new and works great, so far, the only problem I¡¯ve had with it is that the speaker sounds somewhat shot, other than that, great purchase
            "
"197","Not working not unlocked
            "
"198","The phone itself was great. Returned it before use as it was a gift and they already had bought one
            "
"199","Too soon to know too much about it, but so far, so good.
            "
"200","I is a nice phone but the battery life is weak and it gets real hot when charging.slight scratch on screen that I can barely see but screen fine besides that. I would like a replacement
            "
"201","I was very scared at first because of previous reviews, but then I stepped out on faith and My daughter got this phone for her 15th birthday and she is in love with it!
            "
"202","Love it I could be more happy with this purchase thx amazon <U+0001F9E1>
            "
"203","This is my first Iphone, very happy I Purchased it... Great Phone, Easy to use....
            "
"204","So I just got my IPhone 7 and it seems to be good and all, the only thing I was like ""wait this is wrong"" was the charger's adapter (the thing you plug in the wall) so it's a Huawei adapter and it's black doesn't even match with the cable's color, which is white. Am I just going to have to buy an iPhone adapter or what?
            "
"205","Home button will not open the first page. The sleep button will open the first page and then the home button will open the desktop screen.
            "
"206","When I brought this device it didn¡¯t work properly. Struggled to keep connection and all. Even when I put a case over it the singal got very weak and caused me to suffer for months. Also, it power cycles ALOT ( turns off and on) it¡¯s probably foreign objects inside the device so trust me when I say don¡¯t trust or buy from here.
            "
"207","<U+00A0>I just received with this phone with this problem at screen.
            "
"208","I've been using this phone for about a month and so far there hasn't been any major problems about the phone. One minor problem is when I put the phone on silence and take a picture, the shutter sound is still loud. As if it isn't on silence. All in all this phone works as if you bought it from the apple store.
            "
"209","When i first got the phone, it was working fine for a few days and then there was ""No Service."" It said ""Cellular Update Failed"" and i tried everything from restarting, remove and insert sim card again, and to factory reset nothing works! Good thing the warranty is still on. Don't waste your time buying from here.
            "
"210","Came in right on time, had minimal wear just a few tiny paint scratches on the top right corner nothing too bad. Came in well packaged but didn't come in original box. It's fully functional for me at the moment
            "
"211","Great shape, looks almost like new. I'm happy with the phone. Works fine, great price great phone! only thing is the charger isn't original and it says ""not supported"" when I plug it in. Other than that totally recommend phone.
            "
"212","What is this. Before I even turned it on it looks terrible. It was said that there was minimal to no wear but look at the pictures.
            "
"213","I ordered this phone and it says it¡¯s unlocked but it¡¯s not so now I have to find out how to unlock it because it is reported stolen. When I got this phone it was scratched grout he screen and from the side. And the front camera is not working how it should. I got lied to and now I have to waste more money to fix it
            "
"214","Refurbished phone looks and works like new. All data from old phone transferred perfectly.
            "
"215","It was great! the phone came inside a small zip lock bag to try to vacuum seal it as much they can which was great. The phone turned on well and setting it up was easy enough. The phone has been working amazing so far and I would recommend to buy.
            "
"216","No compren, el telefono de repente pierde senal, intente restaurar  y me sale error menos unos -1. Leon en foros que puede ser la placa. Don't  buy, the  last  day  the  iphone don't catcht signal, i tried  to flash  with itunes  and  send me an erro  -1. I cant do anything  with  the iPhone.  In from  Paraguay.
            "
"217","Good value of money. The appearance is excellent. The battery health is 87% and this is the only thing reminds me it's a renewed product.
            "
"218","we bought a refurbished i phone for my son. after about 60 days it crashed hard and had multiple problems  thank god we got the  square trade warranty  they rocked!!!
            "
"219","very happy
            "
"220","The first day I got it my phone would shut up with every phone call and overheat. The only time I could talk on the phone was when I had a headset in!!! I tried getting in contact with the person who sold the phone twice but I response!
            "
"221","Everything was great with this phone! Up until I got my first phone call....(maybe not even half a day of having it) and the speakers didn¡¯t work.. neither did the microphone... sadly I returned it and got a full refund! Very great phone overall but maybe do a more in-depth check
            "
"222","Phone was in great condition and even for a refurbished phone battery health was at 98% will buy again
            "
"223","Wrong phone
            "
"224","Very happy with our purchase,the phone is in excellent shape and it works perfectly.
            "
"225","The phone is great my daughter loves it .She hasn't had any problems with it at all
            "
"226","I was a bit skeptical with the negative reviews but I bought this phone anyway and let me tell you BEST DECISION EVER! The phone arrived like it was brand new. It came with a screen protector on it. I am loving it so far. No problems at all.
            "
"227","Got it for my friend who had a 5. This is the best deal at the moment. Gt it now.
            "
"228","phone in perfect condition, so far I'm happy I have not had any problems, an excellent seller sells what he describes, the phone is like new.  Thank you.
            "
"229","So far so good! All functions working perfectly! Will try to remember to give an update soon.
            "
"230","the item is exactly how it is advertised
            "
"231","Bought the phones for Christmas for my kids. They loved them. No problems at all setting up and to use them.
            "
"232","Good
            "
"233","I was able to just take it to the Verizon store, it was fully unlocked. This was my birthday present and it works very well. There really isn¡¯t anything wrong with it in my opinion execpt the battery life is pretty short in my opinion but I¡¯m also a teenage girl who is almost always on their phone.
            "
"234","I hope anybody buy phone in this business,  my iphone died in 10 months, that really bad product
            "
"235","It doesn't work at all!!
            "
"236","I am so happy with my new phone! The phone arrival was delayed by Hurricane Harvey, but it got here in a box, with a generic charger and a generic cable. The phone is practically new, no noticeable big scratches. I activated it with a GSM carrier and I had no problem (although the tag in the back said it was used with Verizon before, which scared me at the beginning... but it's nice to know that I could use it with a CDMA carrier if I want to). Touch screen and pressure sensor work. I have had it for about a week and a half, so I will post an update in a few months.  This is the first apple product I buy off of Amazon as a certified refurbished device and it is great! Sad that the Iphone 7 does not have a headphone jack (which has nothing to do with the seller or the service, just a general comment)...
            "
"237","Took the phone to a great repair place they said that a bad LCD was put into the phone. Working had to pay to get it fixed
            "
"238","Works like brand new, was expecting something wrong with the screen or battery or the phone itself being slow but it works as if i had just bought it from the apple store. Amazing quality!
            "
"239","The phone came in perfect conditions. No scratches or dents. It works like brand new with no software or hardware issues. Delivery was also faster than expected. The only thing is it doesn¡¯t come with an authentic charger but besides that, i recommend buying this product.
            "
"240","Nice phone for the great Price! Love it
            "
"241","I love this iPhone 7.. I save so much money just getting a used one that look new and smell new ... and it¡¯s unlocked so I can have any cellphone company with this it¡¯s the best !!!
            "
"242","Had the phone for a month now works great,, the only thing is, it¡¯s a little low on the volume when talking on the phone, but it¡¯s not a major problem I would still recommend
            "
"243","I love my phone. I was so surprised to see how well it worked. 10/10.
            "
"244","Hey guys, Iam a normal guy looking for an affordable phone. I saw this and was skeptical but decided to get it. I Am really shocked that it actually worked despite the one stars on the review. Amazon knows what's up and id like to say thanks for actually distributing an almost brand new phone. I encourage people to buy one :)
            "
"245","I love it I needed an upgrade from my iPhone 6(16 gb) silver I love my iPhone 7 rose gold and matches my Apple Watch rose gold I highly recommend this seller to buy or gift to someone who loves apple products
            "
"246","So far so good have only had it a short time
            "
"247","Screen was scratched upon arrival, battery life sucks rocks, does not even last until 9am, I get up at 5.
            "
"248","I love my purchase, I don't regret at all. phone was received in moderate timing, love the fact that the package was huge but my device was protected. I receive a free tempered glass and also 2 free screen protectors. I gave this 4 stars due to the fact that I believe earpods should've been included with the purchase. but overall the phone was in great condition for a refurbished iPhone 7 and I've had the phone for 3 weeks and it still is functional, I have nth bad to say.also the seller was very interactive in ensuring my satisfaction by following up.
            "
"249","Phone came quickly - two scratches on screen were essentially unnoticeable.  I have worked it over, restored from backup, added new music.  All functions work great.  Very satisfied.  Refurbished was an excellent choice.
            "
"250","This product had amazing description. It was supposed to be certified refurbished.But that did not hold true. It had million scratches on the screen. Battery was draining so quick that i had to charge it 5-6 times a day.
            "
"251","Phone runs like a champ, no problems with it at all. Definitely would recommend this to friends and family
            "
"252","thank you. 91 days later stopped working correctly.
            "
"253","Super genial
            "
"254","We are heading to a local repair shop as this phone only worked for six months before developing problems with the microphone and jack as well as other functions.
            "
"255","no me.agrado llego aparentemente bien pero con problemaa en los auriculaes, y problemas de carga por lo tanto quiero devolver el articulo
            "
"256","Super fast shipping!! Very nice phone body. No scratches Etc! Amazon took care of my issue ASAP
            "
"257","Good phone. Worth iut
            "
"258","2 hours of charging heats up the phone a lot but this phone is 100% worth the money
            "
"259","Worked great, looked almost brand new. I could't find any marks on it. Several weeks so far with no problems. Was easy as a T-mobile member.
            "
"260","It works well and haven't had any problems yet but I deopped it and instead of breaking it seems to have indented which makes me think that the screen is made of something other than glass but other than that its good.
            "
"261","This is a review about the quality of the delivered phone, not the experience.The phone was delivered in excellent condition, with an actual apple charger, with no blemishes.Really can't be beat for the price! Will update in the future.
            "
"262","Good
            "
"263","This phone was great until I put my SIM card in and it kept saying no service. I did everything the internet told me to do and nothing to fix it. I guess that¡¯s what I get for ordering another phone off amazon
            "
"264","The iPhone  does not come in the original Apple box; the accessories are not original (cable e charger). The appearance is of a well-used cell phone. I do not recommend! I just did not return because I traveled to Brazil and did not have time to return.
            "
"265","So far, the iphone is working perfectly. No scratches, like new. It works with my t-mobile sim card. There is a little issue I will figure out with the seller. The phone gets very hot quickly. Not sure if this is normal or is just this phone. I will update the post soon.
            "
"266","Phone works great only thing that was bad was I had 2 day shipping and it took a whole week also the picture has a iphone box charger and headphones but I got only a plain white box with no headphones only charger overall love the product
            "
"267","the Phone itself looked great and everything works as it should. That being said! the battery life was only 75% so it needs to be placed on the charger throughout the day. for the price paid it should have been much better
            "
"268","They gave me a bad phone it wasn¡¯t unlocked at all !!
            "
"269","Horrible phone, your better off paying $100 more & buying a brand new 1 from the Apple store, internet never worked on the road, at 1st we thought the problem was the phone provider, until v changed the chip to another phone, daily we had switch off & switch on the phone for the internet part to work.
            "
"270","Perfecto
            "
"271","El telefono esta en muy excelentes condiciones, muy satisfecho de la compra.
            "
"272","Perfect!! No problem at all and it was like new!!
            "
"273","The sound messed up on this approximately 2 weeks after I got it.  It's all static and garbled so no one can hear what I say.  I have to use speaker phone and that doesn't even help much.  I had it in a lifeproof case from the moment I opened it so nothing at all happened to the phone.  It was screwed up from the beginning.  Refurbished is a joke.  Don't buy APPLE's refurbished equipment!  IT'S BROKEN!!!  Wasted a LOT of money.
            "
"274","My daughter loves it everything works on the phone
            "
"275","The phone can not get any network connection after 6 months of useApple is telling me that there is no guarantee on this phoneThis model number had manufacturing issues but Apple won¡¯t exchange the phone
            "
"276","I was hesitant making this purchase (as a gift) after reading the reviews.  Since it comes with free return, I decided to give it a try, and glad that I did.  It's piratically brand new, and it's been working like a new phone.  I will update this review if anything comes up.
            "
"277","Worth the purchase for it being half the normal price. My screen was perfect and all buttons and speakers work as new. Using it right now and so far there hasn¡¯t been any glitches or crashes. Paint on phone is scratch less also..
            "
"278","This phone was made in Hong Kong and is an iPhone knock off. Stopped working after 3 1/2 months won't do anything.

"279","Great phone, like if it is a brand new phone.
            "
"280","Product was in great shape, works as expected. Having issues with the charger cable, and still haven't got a solution to it. I didn't want to return the iphone just for the defective cable. I would be nice to get a new cable to replace the defective cable.
            "
"281","I had zero issues whatsoever with the phone as far as connecting with my mobile carrier. The battery life is phenomenal and the phone is working up to the standards.
            "
"282","It¡¯s the real thing but mine came with scratches on the corners and you can tell it¡¯s refurbished because the screen don¡¯t show colors as good as the new ones i compared it with my friends iPhone 7 they was the same except the screen
            "
"283","The Phone came practically brand new! Also it says 32gb but came with 256gb!! No scratches no scuffs no problems! Will have to see how it goes moving forward but for now it¡¯s a steal!
            "
"284","The iPhone 7 is awesome my son uses it he loves it he has no problems.
            "
"285","Wish I knew the battery life before I purchased (was in the low 80s percent), but overall it is still working as a good back up phone.
            "
"286","Solo pude usarlo 1 dia, las personas que me llamaban no me escuchaban bien, mucha interferencia se escuchaba. Me comunique con el vendedor y lo recibiran de regreso, espero que se haga efectiva la devolucion del dinero.

"288","THE CAMERAS DOES NOT WORK AND I CANNOT SEND IT BACK TO YOU BECAUSE I BROUGHT IT TO BRAZIL AND YOUR FREIGHT DOES NOT COVER THE FREIGHT BACK FROM BRAZIL. I AM WAITING FOR THE PRICE TO FIX IT FROM A BRAZILIAN TECHNICIAN. DO YOU MIND TO PAY IT FOR ME?

"290","Phone came in a cheep box with a cheep charger and no head phones ,even though pitcher showed head phones with the phone.Other than that... phone looked brand new.
            "
"291","I like how much memory it has but it doesn¡¯t have headphones jack so you have to buy an adapter for headphones but it uses the charger outlets so you can¡¯t charge the i7 and listen with headphones at same time.
            "
"292","The iPhone is not working well. It has lots of problems with the signal. My old iPhone was better... went to a Mac station and they didn¡¯t give me a solution. Not happy at all with this phone... :-(

"294","Good product!! Thanks!

"724","""Earpods not included.""Yes, now I see that at the end of the small letters text, they actually do note that on the product page. Let's just say after going through dozens of refurbished iPhone pages reading small script is not big on my list. ""Earpods not included"" not being more obviously stated on the page (in bold, or at least first thing in the description) is my only complain though. The iPhone itself was in good condition, which IS the most important thing. It would be a five star review if I did not feel somewhat cheated by (and embarrassed for not noticing) the small print tricks. But I guess everybody uses those nowadays, so it's ok, right?Update: The phone turned out to be locked! After several months when I took it out of the country and tried using it with another operator it does not work because apparently it is still locked.

I was figuring this issue was with my phone service, so I went to the cricket store, they input my sim card into a different phone but the same exact brand and it worked. I am highly upset I paid a little over $700 for a phone that does not work with my carrier as listed.

"784","The price seems alright compare to others, but this is not prime meaning it¡¯s not handle by amazon.. I bought this thinking it was a prime but it didn¡¯t arrive in two days it was about 3 days. Not a big deal but if you have a prime and you bought a prime item you expected it to arrived in two days.. as you can see in the photos, nothing like new. Scratches and the SIM card slot was put in improper way as they had no time or so. I opened up the phone and it started to warm up like it had been used for gaming or something hard. The worst part is when I try to changed and open the package, it came with Samsung charger... definitely didn¡¯t care much about their items. Last of all I thought I could return it like any other primes and nope I was wrong I had to paid for the shipping for return which I don¡¯t think about buying stuff when it¡¯s labeled as prime product. Would give zero but there is not an option.

"785","But not one but two iPhone 7 from electro wireless and they both had the same problem. The cellular data connectivity was an issue and always left the phone when I turned off the WiFi so I had to reset the phone afterwards every time. I returned the first one and had the same issue with the second one. I tried everything I could think of even contacting my network provider but I didn¡¯t have this issue with my iPhone 5s which still works. Everything else works well but this is two big off an issue to ignore.
            "
"786","EXTREMELY disappointed with iphone 7 and apple's approach to the product fix. Phone never worked as promised - searching for service, not receiving texts, not able to get online and not able to make calls. Struggled with this device for over a year, blaming operator error and service provider. Recently, found out the issue has been a logic board problem all along ... ever hear of the word 'recall'???? Disappointed that apple did not notify as I never imagined the device was a lemon. Wasted time troubleshooting and money on a data plan that was used intermittently.

It was a good phone, unfortunately, I've lost it. Now I bought this iPhone 7 and it came already with a tempered glass protector, a car charger, the sim card removal tool and a case. I'm really happy with my new phone. Thank you!

"790","Really fast, reliable and cool. The only problem is the battery life. But if you don't use too much push alerts, it really last all day long.

"792","I¡¯ve had the phone for a couple days now and there have been no problems with compatibility issues with at&t, calling, or anything else. The battery does go down at a increased rate but the phone is still worth it for the price. It came in with no scratches and looks in perfect condition.

It works with my carrier Ting. I am very pleased and think that this is a great value!

"808","Being that this item is refurbished I waited a while to write the review to see how it hold out after a couple of weeks.  I have to say I am very pleased with this product.  The phone looks pristine and it worked without any falls.  I took it to my phone company and they did not have the slightest problem, it was unlock as it supposed to be.  If this company is taking the time to make sure this phone is presentable and works properly, they are doing a great job to please their customers.  For those reading this review, I hope my case is not the exception.  The one complain however; which I thought it was silly on the company's part, was that the charger.  It is junk.  It looks good and new but it did not charge the phone at a normal speed which tells me it does not have the specs the phone needs to charge properly.  When I used my old charger, the phone fully charges in an hour.  I had it with their charger for over two hours and barely made it to 70%.
            "
"809","I had purchased this iPhone 7 in September 2018 from this supplier.  The phone was working ok for 6 months, but now it will not turn on and is completely dead.  We have tried all ways to hard reboot/reset the phone, but it seems completely unresponsive.  I called Amazon, who followed their procedure and contacted the original vendor TheCellCo.  They were not willing to do anything about it and neither was Amazon A-Z.So the lesson to note about these refurbished phones is that you take a big bet buying from firms like ""TheCellCo"".  Not only do we not know what was refurbished, but the warranty is pretty lame.  I read a few reviews that folks believe that these phones non-OEM parts from China replaced in them and this is likely the cause of the dead motherboard.  While I do not really know what is the cause, I do know that this is a $400 purchase that didn't pay off when we got it and now we are left with a device that is useless.
            "
"810","I am very happy with my reconditioned phone. Although the battery health rating is only 98%. Other than that everything is working well and it was in perfect condition. No scratches at all.

"812","I was nervous about getting an iPhone this way, because the reviews seemed pretty split: a lot of five stars, but a lot of one stars. I decided to take the risk, and got the iPhone 7 for my wife. It's been about two months since she started using it, and we have had NO problems! This review is really just to share my experience with getting a refurbished one here, since you can find reviews for iPhones in other places, with a lot more information.Bottom line, this was a great deal, we had no issues, and if/when I need to get another phone in the future, I'm going to go this route again.
            "
"813","1) The phone had a screen protector on it when I received it. Screen protectors don¡¯t go well with otter boxes, the case that I use.2) The battery was at 90% capacity when I recurved it. I took it into Apple to get it replaced before their battery price increase. They said if there were any non-Apple hardware in it (common of third-party sellers of used iPhones) they would not be able to repair it. Thankfully, there was only apple hardware.3) Three months after buying this phone the microphone stopped picking up sound. Making the phone unusable for its most basic function, phone calls. To fix this problem would have cost me about the same to buy the phone.I ended up replacing this phone after having if for three months.
            "
"814","phone works great and was in great condition. Didn't receive any cables or accessories with it.There IS a shutter sound when you take a picture EVERY SINGLE TIME (my older model muted this if it was in silent mode, but not the case on this phone). If you use this primarily for photography, particularly in public, this might be annoying to you! Saw another reviewer had commented on this but I purchased anyway, almost wish that I hadn't, as it annoys me more than I thought it would.
            "
"815","Upgraded from a 5s and it was the best decision I've ever made!
            "
"816","Bought this phone so I could use it in Korea with a local SIM and because I need to return my primary phone to the manufacturer for a warranty repair for ~30 days and wanted to use it as a backup when I returned to the US. Not sure exactly what the inspection process is as far as ""renewing"" or refurbishing, but the SIM card reader was unable to locate a SIM (tried with several working SIM cards from different carriers & tried the new SIM in other phones without any issues). As if that wasn't disappointing enough, the battery would quickly drain (within ~2-3 hours) *EVEN WHEN THE DEVICE WAS TURNED OFF*. Amazon tech service was unable to sort out the issue and when they put me in touch with Apple, we literally could not get them to pick up the phone for >30 minutes. I'll try another Amazon-supported unlocked iPhone once I get my return credit and I'm hoping the inspection is a bit more thorough this time. I'm also bummed I spent ~$100 in prepaid SIM cards that I have never able to use.
            "
"817","The refurb had a replacement screen and 84% battery health. The body was 9/10 with only one very small ding in the bottom right corner, which is paint matched and unnoticeable unless you're looking for it. You can tell the screen isn't the original when holding it up to a new iphone 7 and diagnostics confirms that. The screen and 84% battery health knocks off at least two stars.
            "
"818","This was an amazing deal. I got the black iPhone with 260 gigs. You. Can¡¯t even tell it¡¯s refurbished.  There is a tiny scratch on the to of the phone but you can¡¯t even really tell with it being black. The screen is perfect. So small scratches or blimishes. It¡¯s running smoothly and so far the battery life is like a new phone. If I didn¡¯t know that this phone was refurbished I would have never guessed.  This is a must buy. I¡¯m on cricket and it¡¯s working like a charm. I switched from using android and have been using one for years it¡¯s going to take a little bit to get use to but that has nothing to do with the phone itself.
            "
"819","I got a refurbished gold iPhone 7 with 128 GB of flash memory from ElectroWireless.I would recommend anyone to buy a refurbished iPhone. The iPhone I got come on time, and showed very little signs of use. Everything works: touch ID, front and read cameras, facetime, WiFi, Bluetooth, and 4G on T-Mobile (GSM).The only thing I did not like was that I got the phone with a battery health around 82%. It can still hold a whole day of usage without problem, but I think the page description should state that the battery might not be a new one.
            "
"820","This was the 4th iPhone I bought, used, online (2 thru Amazon, 2 elsewhere).  All 4 had problems.  This one was hard to see thru the screen and entering any data was problematic.  A refund was given immediately by the seller.  Somebody dropped the ball when the OK'd this one for resale.  I would use the seller again tho.
            "
"821","I love my phone. Shipping didn¡¯t take long at all. So far I have not had any issues with the phone. It can be used with Straight Talk and was easy to get connected. It was in great condition and I have no complaints.

"822","Stay away from this seller.  Selling junk refurbished phones that will stop working after their 90 day warranty.  All the other reviews are true.  Find another refurbish phone seller that is honest and stands behind their product.  Seller refused to make any amends or even meet halfway on the  Iphone that is now is completely useless.  Apple store stated they used inferior parts to fix the phone.
            "
"823","My first purchase of a refurbished phone on Amazon and wow, what a disappointment.  The device screen is heavily scratched.  The description states ""like new"", when in fact this looks nothing like new.  A few minor issues would be reasonable.  I have 3-4 year old phones that look way better than this.  The back has a weird film over it full of smudges and discoloration.  The screen flickers when you press the home key.  There is a space between the top of the screen and casing with what appears to be adhesive.  The volume on/off switch on the side has dirt on it.  The advertisement says GSM unlocked but the sticker on the back says Verizon.  I don't have Verizon.  I didn't even try the SIM card, returning immediately.
            "
"824","What was Apple thinking with this phone? No headphone jack? You have to use bluetooth headphones? (try not to die when you see what Apple charges for those...) It's the same size as the iPhone 6, but less functional without the headphone jack. Would it have killed them to leave it there and still include bluetooth listening? No. No it wouldn't have. Not my favorite ""upgrade"" that Apple has ever put out.
            "
"825","Excellent condition externally. Battery was at 90% life. Decided to have the apple store put in a new battery for $29 (special limited time pricing).  Tests by Apple store showed the compass failed tests, all else OK.  We submitted it for new battery. 3 hours later, at pickup, we were told display was not original and hence had been replaced ($150 value). Fyi it seemed fully functional. Apple was kind to waive the extra charge.
            "
"826","I don¡¯t know why their are so many negative reviews about this phone. I received it in great condition, and then I took it to AT&T, and they put in my SIM card, and I was done. Works like new. I love the phone!

"827","I just purchased this phone for my teenaged son's birthday.  I already had a sim card from a previous upgrade whereas I did not use the card.

            "
"828","You never know what your going to get when ordering online, but I was so  ecstatic to find out that this phone is amazing. It came in good condition.  Are you still have a plus but I switch down to the regular and it¡¯s just perfect pets in my hand I got the Jack Black its beautiful. Haven¡¯t had any problems, and it shows no wear. I plugged in my T-Mobile Sims card and it worked.
            "
"829","Great phone for a great price. Why get an iPhone Xs that¡¯s 3 steps behind Samsung Galaxy S10 when you can get an IPhone 7 with 256 gigs and do the same thing as an IPhone 10.
            "
"830","This is like a new phone, except it still has it's original battery, which is at 82 %, but it holds up a lot longer than my old Iphone 6 with a new battery. The advantage of water resistance is great, which is good if you golf or are outdoors a lot. The 6 is not. You will need to get an adapter to use it with wired headphones. Again it is like a new phone with no scratches on the screen or the body. Everything works very well.

"831","Touchscreen failed at first startup.  Clearly was not tested adequately. Returned.  Disappointed a family member I gave it to as a gift.

"832","I¡¯m very happy with this certified refurbished phone.
            "
"833","Verizon would not accept this phone....we were told it did not match their company numbers to activate. My son swears the description said it was Verizon compatible......NOT. Be careful when ordering that your cell service provider will accept the phone....we had to send it back.

"834","I bought this iPhone 2days ago and so far I have had no real bad problems. The battery life is average and it works just like new. Although occasionally the screen will freeze and I¡¯m nervous that in the future it will break. If you want a nice phone on a  budget (like me) then I do recommend this <U+0001F44D>Also side note it came with everything in the box (not real apple box, just shipping box) except headphones.

"835","I bought this phone for my teen son. It has been unusable for 4 out of 5 months. It says NO SERVICE or SEARCHING FOR SERVICE constantly. All troubleshooting has been done. Apple Store wants $319 for out-of-warranty repair. So, it's only use is for web browsing since he can only connect to the Internet. DISAPPOINTED!
            "
"836","Phone was exactly as described. Also arrived on timeCustomer service communication was excellent.I would recommend Chubbiestech to other customers andthanks again Karen.

"837","Defective product. Certified refurbished means absolutely nothing to this company. Avoid them if possible.

"839","I¡¯ve have the iPhone 7 for about two weeks now. I must say I¡¯m pretty impressed with the ease of using the phone, the battery life, and the overall experience with the phone. It¡¯s lightweight, and has great speed. I was a bit skeptical about purchasing a certified refurbished phone but I have not had any issues thus far.
            "
"840","The product complies with the published and very good quality
            "
"841","Great product, as advertised.
            "
"842","Came in great condition, I couldn¡¯t even tell it was a refurb. Everything was as expected, and has worked perfectly since I bought it (about 2 months ago). The only thing to think about when you buy this is that they don¡¯t include the thunderbolt headphones<U+2014>which they tell you in the description, however, if you¡¯re like me, you¡¯ll forget and be really disappointed the first time you go to plug in your headphones. So just remember- if you buy this, either buy the thunderbolt headphones or get the adaptor cable for normal headphones.
            "
"843","Everything works.No significant scratches or any other signs of use.Minor signs of use on screen but hidden completely by my screen protection glass.No signs of use at all at back panel

            "
"845","The phone arrived in great working condition with one small dent on the back. After one year the microphone broke which is somewhat common with iPhone 7. The audio IC card needs work now which will cost me about 125 to fix.

"846","just as described.  Even came with a glass screen protector attached. And no scratch on the whole thing. Works perfectly. Ive had it several months now.

"865","Bateria al 90 % y algunos detalles en la pantalla. Pero por el precio, mas o menos la mitad de uno nuevo, 100% recomendado. Para las exigencias actuales el iPhone 7 todavia es un celular muy capaz y que puede durar unos cuantos anos mas.

"909","The Touch ID doesn¡¯t work with the phone, and people can hardly hear me on the phone half of the time, they say I sound really really far. I considered returning the phone in the beginning due to the Touch ID, and I wasn¡¯t aware that the quality of my phone calls was bad until later. But I still didn¡¯t want to return it b/c I¡¯m scared that the new phone would have a possible worst defect than what I have currently. It¡¯s dealable but annoying. Besides those two things it works like a charm. Even though it¡¯s a good deal it¡¯s still super expensive to purchase something and it not even be of 100% quality

The photos are so clear. It works perfect. It came fully charged and with a charger. I went into a T-mobile store, and they helped me set it up. I had an 3 year old Alcatel phone, and everything switched over to the iphone easily and without losing anything.
            "
"960","The product is great. It came in perfect conditions. Included screen protector, charger and charging box. The price is resonable but as of turning it on and using it for a week. I have only come across two issues.1) The touch sensitivity is a little off. For example i can never get the iphone control center to come up while im on an App. When im on the home screen it seems to work fast. But if im on an App it glitches and just doesnt want to come up.2) The Speakers! Im not sure if the parts the company that refurbishes it used are genuine Apple parts. When I want to use the speakers on full volume or even close to full volume they have really bad feedback. The sound is scratchy and unattractive. It just doesnt sound like a new untouched iphone would sound.

"971","This is a very fine phone. Truly the best I've ever had. Of course the lack of earphones input is disappointing and even inconvenient but outside of that it's a great phone.
            "
"972","* Update the phone is not working. Straightalk is telling me the phone is locked. Apple wont help because its refurbished. Waiting on the seller to contact me. It's been a frustrating 48 hours. Will update again based on the response from the seller.Arrived just as described. I'm using this phone on  straightalk. It is not compatible with the AT&T SIM card so I did have to buy a new SIM and switch it over to T Mobile SIM but it works perfectly after we figured out the SIM issue.
            "
"973","Actually felt kind of disappointed, although the phone works just fine it came with non-original accesories such as an ZTE charger & cable without any headphones or lightning-to-plug cable. I had to buy all these in the Apple store paying more than $50. If I knew this, probably I wouldn't have bought a refurbished phone & would have just bought it brand new at Apple store. My insatisfaction comes by the lack of information, when I buy a ""Certified Refurbished"" product I expect to find it just as if it was brand new, I've done this with other products & received the same presentation kit as if it was from the brand store, while this phone got to my hands in a plain white box which isn't the original one. Perhaps, if I knew this before purchasing the product, I would have chosen other supplier or wouldn't have bought the product.
            "
"974","works great

"975","with much skepticism after reading many negative reviews, i purchased this phone.

            "
"976","The phone had a few scratches on its screen, and I guess when I think refurbished, I think ""fixed"", in more than just turning on. Oh, well. It worked out fine. Till I sold it for the infinitely more wonderful Google Pixel 2.

            "
"1014","Came as expected, working fine with no problems. Actually, looking at getting another!
            "
"1015","ever since I got this phone it has not worked properly. It does not connect to wifi, and even if it does nothing works. You cannot get calls and the cellular data works slowwwwww. It has been a pain to me. I cannot do nothing with my phone.
            "
"1016","Despite bad reviews, it set up easily and worked well. All iphones don't have the best battery life, so I won't necessarily count that against it. Overall, a great purchase.
            "
"1017","I received the defective phone on the board that inviabiized the microphone and I can not use the phone for its main function that is to speak. I Wanted to know how to return it and get my money back. I Bought the device for delivery in the U.S.A. but brought to Brazil that's where I live. Now I'll have an extra charge to remit the device back.
            "
"1018","I like that the product comes with all the features the normal brand new iPhone 7 comes with. Something I dislike is the battery died unusually fast and that is frustrating when out without a charger.

"1026","I¡¯ve seen a lot of bad reviews for this phone based on issues with the seller. Granted, some of those reviews say it took a few weeks for the problems to appear so I¡¯ll edit this if that happens, but wow was I happy with what I got. Not only did it come with a charger (there¡¯s some debate on that in other reviews), but it even had a clear bumper case. That was neither expected nor necessary but I appreciated it (I bought a Unicorn Beetle case which I have used and loved before on other phones). There wasn¡¯t a scratch on this phone and it started working right away for me. The battery seems to be holding up fine. All in all I¡¯d say this seems like a steal. If it self destructs on me in the next few weeks I¡¯ll update this.UPDATE: It's been a few months and a trip overseas since I wrote that initial review, and it remains a solid decision I'm very happy with.
            "
"1027","Returning. For one, it was not an unlocked phone. I've had it for a month and the screen has started going black every few minutes, and sometimes it freaks out and tells me I have no way to connect to wifi or cell coverage (despite being somewhere with wifi and usually 4G). I'm returning before the problems escalate.Note- it doesn't come with a charger or with headphones.
            "
"1028","Before I even turned it on I tried to put it in a case and saw that the screen had popped out of the casing. The phone wouldn't turn on so I tried to charge it. The cable was loose in the charging port and the phone never powered on!!
            "
"1029","Awful. Paid $510 to get a defected camera that does not work. Would not recommend buying from this 3rd party seller. Every time I try to take a picture my phone freezes. Have been trying to reach out to the seller for awhile now and have been unable to contact them.
            "
"1030","My son had not had his iPhone 7 for even 3 months when he started experiencing problems.  His phone is well protected with a screen protector and in a case and was not dropped in water.  However, the Home button and keyboard keys stopped functioning.  Since he was unable to even unlock his phone the Apple technician I spoke with online stated a full restore would be needed.  After the restore was complete, an error message appeared stating ""The Home Button May Need Service"".  I was hopeful I would at least be able to setup his phone and update from the Cloud.  But unfortunately, was unable to get beyond the message.  So now I must go to the Apple store in hopes that they will be able to somehow resolve this issue.  I have purchased 2 certified refurbished iPhones in the past, and this is the first time I have any issue or any kind.  But this has been such an incredibly frustrating experience, I can't imagine purchasing another certified refurbished phone.
            "
"1031","Just usb cable and charger in box but iphone 7 not in there

"1033","The refurbished iPhone 7 I ordered for my wife for mother's day was defective. I spent a lot of effort to back up her information and transfer to the new phone, even installed tempered screen protectors, go through the set up process with iPhone, only to discover no signal/service available. i switched sim cards several times and it worked well with my previous iPhones. The unit is defective. I thought refurbished was checked and were good as new. The seller only replied to get my order number and didn't reply again (or is taking too long). I'm not waiting for your reply, I'm just returning everything.
            "
"1034","I just got this phone and it¡¯s amazingggg. Great camera quality and easy to transfer my number from my old phone to here. I got it like it was brand new!! I really enjoy it
            "
"1035","The iPhone arrived with minor scratches on the back, but other than that the phone works perfectly fine! I have been using it for awhile and haven't noticed any complications with the battery or anything yet. I am very happy with this purchase!
            "
"1036","Exactly as described. Unlocked . Worked immediately in excellent condition. Battery is in prime condition.I believe the people that are reading negative reviews are using iPhones that they received from these guys to try and put their SIM card from Verizon or Sprint which are still pulling from cdma based networks which is why it's not going to workThe phone is GSM unlocked not factory unlocked there is a big difference the sooner people educate themselves on the difference the better off our society will be
            "
"1037","Phone worked only for 1day and then it started acting up. It was stuck on the apple logo and it kept going off and on. Please don¡¯t trust these product. On top of that I had to pay additional $10 to return it.
            "
"1038","This phone looks and performs like it's brand new. Not one scratch. The phone came with a screen protector and a charger. I was surprised as other reviews said they did not get one. For $269, I feel like this was a steal, compared to other listings. Hopefully nothing goes wrong with the phone later. But with the Amazon 90 day guarantee I'm a little more at ease. Never bought a refurbished phone before. Not sure what to expect. As far as my order, I am happy with it.
            "
"1039","I actually never write reviews. I am a business owner and I know what it feels like to have a bad review posted. That being said I want to warn the consumer.I ordered the phone it being factory refurbished I new it was risky but, the savings was enough to consider. The phone worked for a total of two days. Then began to shut of and continue restarting and then saying on for about 1 second and shutting down again. I then had to go a verizon store and just get a phone because I needed a phone by that time...Hear is the biggest hassle to return the phone you have to take Iphone cloud off. I couldn't do that because my phone wouldn't turn on. I called them and they sent me a link. I had to login and switch the phone to no longer in use. For most people that may not be a problem. I'm not very tech savy so again it was just more of a hassle.The company did have amazing customer service they picked up right away. That why this isn't a 1 star. They also had an easy solution to turning the Iphone  cloud off.
            "
"1040","The phone came with a case and a screen protector..the phone is perfect its new theres no scratches no cracks way better than expected
            "
"1041","Purchased this refurbished phone to replace my Iphone 6, only to have it freeze up every few seconds using it.  Had to hit sleep button, resign in, and continue what I was doing, but this happened way to much and found extremely annoying.  I was unable to return it, because I waiting to long to activate it.  So, I had the front screen replaced, and everything worked fine.  I agree with other people, that if you are selling refurbished products, it should be fully tested, before selling for over $400.  Very annoying.
            "
"1042","The device stopped working after less than three week. I tried to contact the seller and was unable to get any substantial communication. I had hardware issues that I was unable to have fixed right away because I was out of country. I had to pay Apple to replace the parts because they were not actually Apple parts. This is a purchase I truly regret making, I have been extremely disappointed!
            "
"1043","First, seller did a great job and I think I got a good price for an iPhone 7, I just think ALL CELL PHONES are way way way too expensive. When a Cell phone costs more than a good laptop computer that is too expensive.  Second all Smart phones have horrible battery life.  Apple's iPhones are no exception.  There is a mode on the iPhone 7 to allow for an extended battery life setting.  But I see no difference between the extended setting and the normal setting.  I do not use my phone except for emergencies so I would expect the phone to last 5-6 days between charging, but I am averaging 3-4 days between charging.  I am having an issue that the WiFi doesn't see both of my wireless networks (dual band router). Seller tried to help but Apple's support said if it sees a network that's all they care about.  Phone appears to be working fine and so far I am happy with it.
            "
"1044","Excellent phone! Not even a scratch on it! Only drawback is that,it has come without a box and earphones or a connector and an original iPhone charger!
            "
"1045","This iPhone 7 matte black was a good purchase for me because my old phone was slow and battery would run out fast but with this iPhone it seems to last me the whole day of usage without charging it back but theres two problems first the fingerprint doesn¡¯t work so good it took me a while to set up because it would say an error and second of all when I wanted to put it to charge, it wouldn¡¯t charge unless I fixed its position but overall I can fix those miner problems and it was worth it.
            "
"1046","Be cautious, this says Apple is the seller but once you purchase it will update the ""sold by"" line to a third-party seller (mine was called MyWit). That means you're not covered by Apple protections on a refurbished device. The phone I got didn't have it's battery replaced in the refurbishment. I had Apple run a test within a month of purchase and they said it definitely needed to be replaced (battery drained to 25% after using it for 3 hours) and it would cost $30 for a new battery (I eventually talked Apple out of this once they realized how I had been mislead, and how the refurbishment was done poorly). When I contacted MyWit for a replacement, they said they don't do replacements, but I could return the phone and buy a new one. Seems reasonable, except that the price was fluctuating every day and had increased between $20-$60 since I had purchased it.The phone works OK now that I got Apple to fix it, but just be aware this isn't actually Apple selling it, so it's a riskier buy. Go to Apple.com and look at their refurbished devices if you want to be sure your phone was properly refurbished.
            "
"1047","Overall a great product. Came in almost perfect condition with a glass screen protector already on it. I did have to get the battery replaced, no big deal. Shortly after the battery was replaced the camera and flashlight stopped working. Apparently this is an issue with the iPhone 7s in general (that's a risk you take when buying a refurbished phone)... I was able to get it replaced as well though and I have a perfect working phone.
            "
"1048","My 32 GB 6 got knocked over by a 3 year old the other day and some wonky pixel lines messed up my screen, so that I couldn't even unlock it.  I got this 128 GB Black 7, and now I have tons of room.  It looks and feels brand new, charged like a champ, battery life has been great, camera is wonderful even using my iphone 6 case.  I could not be happier.  Seriously, I'm dancing around about this purchase!

"1050","Phone WAS NOT unlocked when it arrived. Was still locked by AT&T. Had to call Apple Care and AT&T before I could get the phone unlocked and operational.

"1051","I can¡¯t even use the phone because it won¡¯t read any SIM cards... can¡¯t make calls or text anyone and can¡¯t use data. Super irritated and probably will never do this again. I¡¯m returning my today.
            "
"1052","The phone came with its own screen saver and had no cracks on it. Was worried about getting a broken one like some of the reviews, but it works (for now anyway). But there¡¯s a camera shutter sound whenever I take a picture (iPhone camera, Snapchat, instagram, etc). I looked online and they said that phones in other countries have it illegal to have the shutter noise on silent (but in the US it isn¡¯t like that), so if anyone knows how to silence that it will be great. Everything else on the phone is fantastic!

"1053","I bought this phone for my mother and she loves it. It was in great condition and functioning great! Also came with a tempered glass cover on it «Ã
            "
"1054","The phone was shipped on time, looked great and functioned correctly.  However, it was not unlocked and I am unable to get my current carrier (AT&T) to unlock it so I can switch carriers.  I now have to call the other major carriers to see if I can convince them to do it or just purchase another phone that is for the carrier that I want to switch too.  Ultra frustrating.
            "
"1055","There are too many problems. The earphone was not heard from left side. Also when I call, I can hear the other person's voice, but other person can't hear my voice. The problem is serious <U+0001F621>
            "
"1056","Be careful ordering from this seller. Do not buy. When I received the phone, I went to turn it on at the boost mobile store and he was able to give me a new sim card, (which I paid for) and a number. The boost mobile store guy then told me it was not picking up a signal and he tried updating the phone, and it did not work. He told me that it was a known iphone 7 problem, and I had to go to the apple store. I went to the apple store who first told me they would send the phone out (to I am guessing apples corporation because they could not fix it in the store) and give me a phone to use until I get mine back. Another lady then came to me and said since the phone was refurbished that they would send it out but the corporation would just send it back unfixed because it is refurbished, so they gave me another option to trade my iphone 7 in to them since it is in perfect condition and it is worth $250 off of whatever phone I buy from them. I then looked up the ¡°problem¡± the iphone 7¡¯s are having, and it says some iphone 7¡¯s Apple has determined that a small percentage of iPhone 7 devices may show ""No Service"" in the status bar (even if cellular coverage is available), due to a component that has failed on the main logic board, the seller also lied and said thathe checked everything to see if it works, which he lied he knew it would be like this. Now I am going through all this trouble teying to figure out what to do, so beware you will be waisting your money, and time.
            "
"1057","I am totally unsatisfied with the bought. The iPhone is defective and I tried to return the item but Amazon informed I have to pay to do that and this is extremelly expensive here from Brasil. I would also like to be able to return the product but without having to for very expensive mail rates in Brazil.  I wish I had not made the purchase.
            "
"1058","I have to return it.  Not fully unlocked.  I couldn't connect it to Tmobile.  We wasted  a day going to Tmobile and then Apple store.  No one was able to help us.  They said couldn't connect to network.  VERY, VERY unhappy.
            "
"1059","So the iPhone itself on the outside was good looking. Small scratch on the bottom of the screen. Software seemed to work okay but I only had it a few hours before I decided to return it. This is why: I went to test out the camera and it couldn't focus on something even when I tapped on the screen to tell it what to focus on. The screen when using the camera ""jiggled"" and my husband pointed out the clicking sound coming from the hardware of the device. Then I noticed the camera was shaking! Then we couldn't hold the phone because it overheated! So yeah it got sent back. True review with no lies.
            "
"1060","I have gotten a Japanese or Korean phone and I¡¯m in the states. My camera shutter sound will not turn off because it¡¯s illegal there to have the shutter sound off.  The phone will not stop glitching and crashes a lot. It looked like it was in great condition but it was not.
            "
"1061","I was extremely excited to get my iPhone 7, but it turned out to be a very frustrating situation. I went through the process to start up the phone and get to the home screen. The first thing I tried was to put my SIM card into the phone, but it didn¡¯t work. It searched for minutes only to say ¡°No Service¡±. Then I tried using the camera app, but it glitched out every time I attempted to take a photo or record a video. I looked up the problem and the articles said to check Voice Memos to see if you get ¡°Recording Failed - No audio devices found.¡± <U+2014> unfortunately, I had this problem. The only good aspect to this phone was its look, nothing else. Overall, the phone is broke and unusable. I bought my phone from ElectroWireless; they ripped me off completely. I expected a working phone from the description, but instead I was shipped an exact opposite of it. I am very upset.
            "
"1062","The phone(iPhone7 - 256GB - black) came with a fried modem. Within 24 hours an alert saying ¡°Carrier Update Failed¡± popped up. After that I had no bars, instead it was replaced with ¡°No Service¡± and a warning icon.Besides the defective internals, The outer casing and glass were in good condition. Only minor nicks in the aluminum from the previous owners case.I¡¯m currently sending the phone to Apple for the iPhone ¡°No Service¡± repair program, as it is still eligible.

"1064","I bought this phone and within 6 weeks, the motem had totally failed, which prevented me from getting any service at all.

"1066","Product worked fine for first two months and whenI travelled abroad it did not last more than two days. By the time I returned from abroad, the return window period closed.

"1068","I got this phone back in March after my old one was stolen. It was decently priced and I was desperate. It worked great, looked and felt brand new, I had no problems connecting it with my carrier! After about 6 months, it started to freak out and restart all the time. My apple ID no longer would work so my imessages were turned off, I couldn¡¯t facetime. It was a nightmare! Also when I would barely put it down on a table the screen would freak out and it was restart again. Sometimes I would have to forse wake it. The people at the Apple Store told me that there was something wrong with the hardware and that many certified refurbished phones have had their hardware touched or messed with during the refurbishing process. I ended up getting a brand new phone about 8 months after I purchased this one. Bottom line, don¡¯t buy this phone if you want it for a long period of time it will have so many problems in the long run and it¡¯s more worth it to spend the money on a new phone.
            "
"1069","I ended up searching on Amazon for the iPhone 7 after my original was non functional and two of the replacement phones the AT&T insurance vendor sent were also individually non-functional not to mention they only had black when I originally had a silver/white that matched my case. They sent me a check to find my own and so I got a refurb here in my desired color.Everything is pretty much equivalent to my original phone in wear and tear (minor scratches and dings) aside from the fact that the screen lifts on the bottom left a little and I feel it may be effecting the touch screen efficiency.I was also surprised to find it had a screen cover already on it when I received it which I bought separately with the phone not expecting that bonus! So I was very pleased.I also received a charging block and cable with the phone.

"1070","Purchased is item based on the Amazon reviews. Extremely unhappy with the purchase and the item is not as described. Below are the issues I faced on this refurbished phone.1) When making and receiving calls hear alot of noise ( like raining on the other side and birds chip sound). It took some time to realize from where that sound is coming, tried calling multiple numbers and its the same everytime.2) Phone gets over heated and felt like its going to blow up. Very scary.3) Noticed battery drops from 92% to 76% with a single call which lasted for 5 min. Definitely not a good battery, could be fake.4) Noticed call drops and ""No Service"" while on the phone. Weird, had to do sim in and out. Seems like the SIM card tray is not firm.5) The speakers on the phone are not functioning as it supposed to be, very distorted sound.Very unhappy with the purchase
            "
"1071","Very satisfied with my refurbished iPhone 7, been using it from like 3 weeks and everything looking and working fine, its looks like its almost new and came in a really good package and a screen protector (tempered glass) to protect it, it also came with USB lightning cable and a wall adapter, the only thing I did not like about this seller (and I¡¯m not really sure if is he's fault), is that it came without invoice, but I know that happens sometimes so, its not a big deal.

"1073","This phone looks new and the battery is phenomenal. Popped in my T Mobile sim and it was ready to rock and roll. Everything about this phone has been as expected EXCEPT the screen. Sometimes it works perfectly, but about half the time it does not. It doesn¡¯t recognize the correct location where touching the screen. For example, I¡¯ll try typing a word but it¡¯ll recognize keystrokes from the other side of the keyboard. If I lock and unlock the screen a few times it will act normally.  I cannot find out how to reach their tech support.
            "
"1074","So far, I LOVE this phone. Looks like new, everything works as it should, battery holds its charge great. No issues whatsoever. Even the clerk as TMobile commented on what a great phone it is, and at such a terrific price.
            "
"1075","I was nervous upon buying this however it did not disappoint. The phone was in perfect condition, however did not come with the original charger. There was no damage, works perfectly and doesn¡¯t seem to have any functioning issues.
            "
"1076","Phone seems to work well and is fast. Arrived looking great. The battery how ever is bad. Per the phones battery health the battery is degraded and will not hold a charge. I can not even use it for an hour.
            "
"1077","I bought this from BuySpry In September 2018. The battery was just 1% higher than the cut off limit for the free battery replacement from Apple, until the first week of 2019 (when the battery replacement wouldn¡¯t be free anymore). Now (April 2019), it¡¯s at 75% max capacity and doesn¡¯t last for long after just casual use.It arrived with a little chip out of the side near the volume buttons. It¡¯s just cosmetic but it still irks me.The screen is also starting to mess up. It doesn¡¯t always sense when I swipe across the screen to answer a call or when I type.So now I¡¯m going to be down another $50 at least to get another digitizer and battery.I gave it 3 stars for value for money because I¡¯m still not sure if it would¡¯ve been easier and cheaper in the long run to just buy new.
            "
"1078","Overall, this was a great phone and a nice purchase. It did come two days late, but it wasn¡¯t a major issue for me. The phone came well packaged and was not damaged. However, there are a few white specks on the back of the phone that I can¡¯t remove and there is also a small scratch on the screen, but nothing too bad. It works perfectly fine and is pretty fast. It is also ¡°GSM unlocked¡±, which Verizon said wouldn¡¯t work with their carriers. But I tried the SIM card anyways, and it actually worked. So overall, I¡¯m really pleased with this purchase.
            "
"1079","Seems to work well. I¡¯m enjoying a battery that lasts overnight and apps that don¡¯t crash every time they open (like my poor older phone). Overall, seems to be a good product so far. A couple minor dings on the corners of the phone but it came with a screen protector which is great. My only other complaint is that it has trouble with my parents¡¯ WiFi, but they don¡¯t have the fastest internet to start. And of course I hate that it doesn¡¯t have a headphone jack (but that¡¯s an iPhone thing not an amazon thing).
            "
"1080","Saved up for months and months to purchase this, when I received it, the camera was completely broken. The exterior looked strange and it refused to take any pictures. The lens would shake and shake and it would show a blue screen but the rest of the phone was functional.

"1081","The phone was in perfect shape. But it did not work with my Xfinity account (uses Verizon network). Too bad. Nice phone. They did a quick refund, about a days turnaround. Pretty incredible.

"1082","This is a recurring experience to me !!!. The price was very attractive but you know every cheap thing always comes with a hidden cost.  The iPhone worked only 14 hours !!!, and then it suddenly turned off without any warning. Since then it never worked again. Taking into consideration that the seller was a certified seller, I went to an apple store to get it fixed cause seller said the mobile phone came with 90 days of warranty. Apple store guys told me ""this phone was sold damaged by us and also sold AS IS !!! we can't believe this seller did not warn the buyer about the phone condition."" I say it is a recurring experience cause in many times ""certified sellers"" are not as certified as the must be. Apple store was located in Boston (Boylston). Finally time wasted for nothing !!.

"1083","Wi-fi button doesn't work, so you can't connect to wi-fi even after restarting the phone, battery shows different digits every minute from charged 80% to 5% in just a minute. The phone would turn off and on by itself. After purchasing this item I sent it back and got a refund. Although after about a month my card was charged 130$ from Amazon and I didn't make this purchase. This phone was the only item I used the card for this website. So yeah terrible phone and possible fraud on the card from this account.
            "
"1084","I think this is a knock-off item. On the back of the phone, it has the words ¡°iPhone product¡±. It¡¯s not a real iPhone.Also, it did not come with the earbuds and lightening jack connector as advertised. These we will end up needing to buy separately. It works, but it¡¯s pricey for basically a fake iPhone.
            "
"1085","This is my second iPhone purchase from amazon but first from this seller and I am very happy! It actually came a day earlier than promised which is awesome! It has two TINY scratches on the back but you really cannot see them so it looks and works as a brand new phone! Thank you!
            "
"1086","I just received my product today. Comes with a screen protector and lookes like new. I see no scratches or dents etc. I too was skeptical about this product for being 290$. So far works perfectly I just popped in my SIM card and it worked right away. I highly recommend buying this!

"1087","My iPhone 6 took a swim and I didn't want to $700 -$1000 for a new phone.  This phone works great, I just transferred my AT&T sim card and updated via iCloud.  The iPhone 7 and above are ""waterproof"".  It's the same size as the iPhone 6.
            "
"1088","Bought this as a gift for mothers day. Was going to be first iPhone, so I didn't really care if it was somewhat slow and the battery didn't work as good. Well, after I received it, I checked it out myself and I was impressed and satisfied with what I was looking at. The touch, speakers, battery and screen were in great condition. I do wish they would just wipe down the phone and clean it before sending it out though.
            "
"1089","Very unhappy about my purchase the phones are supposed to be unlocked so you can program them and they are not I have to return it and with that I am out on the screen protectors as well

"1090","So far so good.Bought refurbished iphone7 128gb from eKings.I received this product within a week. It came in a plain white box, it did come with brand new apple charger. The phone looks brand new. No scratches, the screen and back have a protective film on it which I appreciate. So far from what I have tried everything works. I did notice a little dust in the charger port and speaker area but that¡¯s no big deal. I did notice the phone got hot when I used an off brand charger.I will try to update this post in a month or two.
            "
"1091","OMG I finally got it! Now I know why kids will stand on line for iPhones for hours. After fooling around with Motorola smart phones for 9 years, none of which were particularly impressive or worked particularly well, I have finally come away from the darkside of cellular and into the light. This thing is great and it wasn't very hard to set up. The security on the phone is outstanding. I bought this iPhone 7 (256GB) for myself and the iPhone 7+ (128 GB) for my wife for less than $1K .  All my kids, and grandkids told me that the iPhone 7, with loads of memory, and an upgrade to the IOS 11 operating system was the way to go. They were right. These phones are an outstanding value.
            "
"1092","My son purchased this phone because he broke his phone. The phone was not charged at all, and the charger they sent with it was not an apple accessory; it would not charge the phone. I had to charge it with my charger before I could do anything. It just seemed like a very cheaply done refurbish. Won¡¯t purchase from them again. It was still expensive and should have come with the proper charging equipment.
            "
"1093","The phone is in very good condition, the carcass did not have any type of scratch, mark of blow or damage; the touch screen works without problems; the quality of the audio is very good when making calls; Apple's own functionalities work without problems. It includes a generic charger and does not include headphones
            "
"1094","This is working out perfectly so far... great condition, great battery life so far... the only thing I didn't expect was the glass protection screen already on it... it made the cover I got for it a little difficult to install. Other than that... very happy so far with it.
            "
"1095","Ok after a month of use I can say the phone is like brand new for $400 (what a bargain). Got the phone in a nice box with a charger, cable and an Amazon renewed booklet. I'm using the phone outside of the US without any issue.

"1096","Very bad, recive with scratches!
            "
"1097","Prompt shipping. Phone looks brand new. Works great, but it has only been a couple of days. The battery is only 84%, but that is to be expected on a refurbished phone, and can be easily replaced in the future. All good so far! 100% happy.
            "
"1098","I got what I paid for. An iPhone refurbished, working and rolling. Only minor scratches (like one small). I haven't fully see how battery life will be, but seems okay. I bought it from Quick Deals CR (with Prime). If you want an iPhone, plus the benefits when buying from Amazon, I think it's a good deal.

"1104","I¡¯ve had this phone for less than a year. I¡¯d love to return but they won¡¯t let me ( of course). And within 6 months the vibrate features became very aggressive. I¡¯m told I was sold a phone with a faulty Taptic Engine as well as an often unresponsive touch screen. I¡¯d like to buy a newer iPhone but I can¡¯t sell it to anyone bc I can¡¯t justify f***ing anyone over with a phone that is ¡°operational but still broken¡±

            "
"1108","Phone arrived on time and included a charger. I had to revise this review after a few days of receiving the phone. Everything was fine. The phone worked and got service. I absolutely loved it. However, the phone randomly stopped working with Verizon. I couldn't send/receive text messages or phone calls and it wouldn't even connect to wifi. I had no way of contacting anyone and I had to be somewhere that night. It was beyond frustrating. I went to Verizon to hopefully fix the issue, but the IMEI number on the phone was not even legit and they could not do anything. Spend the extra money to get a real iPhone from Apple or a trusted friend. It is not worth the hassle, trust me.
            "
"1109","The phone it¡¯s selfnis alright, the charger I received with the phone has stopped working all together. I take good care of my things so I know it¡¯s not me. I received my phone at the end of October. It is December 6th and my charger isn¡¯t working. That is a problem. Now I can¡¯t even charge my phone anymore.
            "
"1110","Phone is awesome. When you're on a call the volume is low could barely hear  so we switch to speaker. But over all the phone is great ot looks great no other problems i will be buying again in the very near future.

"1111","My package came on time and the iphone 7 looked new. There were no scratches or marks on it. it's unlocked so no bundled apps to bog down the system. It works great with T-mobile. I paid 1/2 of what i would have paid if i went to the A Store. It has the larges memory and the best price and functions well so far.

"1114","Overall the phone is great especially for the price. It¡¯s Friday April 26th, 2019 and I¡¯ve had my phone for a week now. I read a lot of comments about not being a bale to use the phone due to network problems, but mine worked perfectly. I¡¯m with cricket who¡¯s also owned by AT&T and literally all I did was switched SIM cards and the phone worked. I had an android and did the switch and had to save contacts and other information, but it¡¯s a great purchase
            "
"1115","The phone is not unlocked. The battery life is zero. So upset cos Ispent so much time now need to look for another phone.

"1116","the first few days the phone was working real fine and when it came to the 3rd day the service went out and i went to tmobile and they said its been reported stolen. Then the day after the charger won't fit all of a sudden and also the screen would randomly go black. I hope i get my money back for all this.
            "
"1117","My phone works great, I have had it for over an year now. The only problem is once when an Apple software update had a glitch and my phone started rebooting continuously, and I couldn¡¯t rely on Apple¡¯s Genius services to solve it. But I guess that is the only downside.
            "
"1118","We have been using the phone for about a month now -- ZERO ISSUES!  Arrived in perfect shape.  No scratches at all.  Unlocked and works great in Germany.  Arrives in plain box with charger plug and usb charger.  Highly recommend refurb over new.  Great value.

"1120","I don't usually give five stars on any of my reviews so this item is a rarity.  Phone worked perfectly on GSM T-Mobile.  Just inserted the SIM and added Apple account and the phone hasn't given me any issues after about six weeks of heavy use.  The phone had absolutely zero blemishes or any type of damage.  Absolutely no scuffing of housing or scratches on screen.  It looked brand new.  Sorry no pictures.  Very happy with this purchase and will be looking at buying another from this seller.  Hopefully it'll be in similar conditions.

            "
"1124","Phone keeps disconnecting from cellular service. Apple claims this is normal for this model and it needs to be repaired. If the refurbishing replaced any of the internals this will cost $319.

"1125","I brought this as an early Christmas gift for my husband. This phone came earlier than the estimated shipping. I also think the cost was inexpensive. The condition was great, no complaints from either one of us. My husband loves his phone and now on team Apple. I will definitely be purchasing again when it¡¯s time for an upgrade
            "
"1126","Battery was at 100%. There were no scratches or marks on the phone at all. Came with a screen protector already in place and generic charger.

"1128","Bought this device for my mother-in-law's birthday. Everything looked fine, however, the audio was damaged and came through muffled. I returned the device for a replacement and after almost two weeks have not received it. Not worth the headache. Get your refurbished devices directly from Amazon or Apple and save yourself the trouble.

"1129","I received the phone quickly and it was in good condition, looks like a brand new phone and worked perfect. About a week maybe two weeks later the microphone completely stopped working; couldn¡¯t talk on the phone or speak to text or record videos. Tried everything to fix it myself, eventually calling Apple for them to tell me that this is a common issue  with the iPhone 7 and the only way to fix it was to make an appointment at the Apple Store which for me is almost 2 hours away.  So just beware of any iPhone 7, not from this seller in particular but I would just get a 6S they are just as good actually better because I¡¯ve had no issues with my 6.
            "
"1130","First off I¡¯d like to say the phone was perfect. Everything was perfect. It was the color I wanted, the size I wanted, it all worked great. I even activated it with my phone carrier. It worked for a few minutes, connected and all. I even bought my fiance a phone and activated his (from a different seller). I tried to order a car service and realized that I didn¡¯t have service. It started searching and kept saying no service. I took it back to my carrier and they took a look at it again and apparently this is a problem of yours. The phone constantly shuts off on me and it won¡¯t connect to any SIM card. I¡¯m getting my money back. *annoyed*

"1136","Item was defective. Sent it back for repair and they sent it back with the same issues. When I contacted them again they told me to take it to Apple. Apple was unable to repair the phone and told me my only option was a new phone. Comtacted the third party company selling on Amazon again and they told me they would fix it for a fee but a refund Or replacement was not an option. What good is their warranty if they won't replace a phone they can't fix.

"1139","I  originally bought this phone to upgrade from my old 5S I absolutely love it!  However I am not able to use it with Verizon  as the description states!  Was hoping I would be able to because some of the other reviews  said that it would work with Verizon but,  mine doesn't  also it would be  Smart to pay attention to the seller.  I bought mine from dealFisher.  The reason I'm not going to return this is 1 because  i'm absolutely in love with the phone .  The camera is awesome and the sound is awesome.  And 2  because I already bought a phone case for it. Every gigabyte I ordered is on there  and the phone was exactly as described. So,  I guess I'll use this phone for Facebook  and use my old 5S as just a phone.  I would suggest if you're on Verizon don't buy this phone  unless you're using it for social media and things of that nature.  If anything changes I'll come back and update this review.

"1156","Good quality smartphone. I am very happy with the purchase.

However 2 days later it decreased to 88 and 2 more days later to 86. Battery wouldn¡¯t last more than 4 hours.Solution to this, i had to go to apple and replace the battery. For 50 USD they get you a new battery and the iphone works like Brand New. I really recommend this solution if you go through the same problem. However, it involves spending 50 more bucks which is annoying.

"1174","I bought this certified refurbished phone from Electronic Deals in late October and it died last night (6th February) and has not responded to any methods I've tried to reboot the phone.  I doubt I will ever buy another refurbished phone.
            "
"1175","nice item
            "
"1176","Great condition no complaints so far
            "
"1177","I¡¯ve had the phone for about 3 months and when I got it it looked brand new I checked the battery health and it was at 100% nothing looked messed up at all there may have been a scratch on the back of the phone but I never notice it. Overall this phone was in perfect condition and I have no complaints about it.
            "
"1178","El iPhone llego en dos dias, excelentes condiciones No rayones, completamente desbloqueado. Solo compre la Sim Card aparte, la instale llame a servicio al cliente de la compania telefonica y Listo!!  No trae audifonos El cargador que trae no es el original, pero para mi eso no importa. Este es el segundo iPhone que compro con esta compania y todo muy bien. Jamas compraria un telefono nuevo son muy caros, este es buena opcion
            "
"1179","Camera lens was scratched and battery was in poor condition, dropping from 85% to 80% in a few days. I sent it back
            "
"1180","Como puedo hacer un reclamo.  En marzo del 2018  compre un telefono  aphone 7 y de repente me sale que no hay servicio o sea sin Senal. Se sobreentiende que lo compre desbloqueado. Como puedo hacer el reclamo ? su ayuda por favor  A parte que supuestamente lo pague por nuevo y ha sido bien usado.
            "
"1181","So when I recieved this phone it worked greato, but after a few days I kept losing phone service. This happened twice. I finally took it to the Apple store. Come to find out there is a free repair for the problem I was having. It does take 7-10 business days for it to get sent off, but it's a very common problem and Apple will either fix the problem or send you a brand new phone. This phone IS a VERIZON refurbished phone.
            "
"1182","The phone I got was in ok condition. A few scratches here and there and one big one one the front of the screen right in the middle where u see it pretty much all the time. The battery healt is at 88%. Other than that I still consider the refurbished phone a pretty good value.
            "
"1183","The phone arrived without a microphone to talk into, so calls were unable to be made. Despite the era of texting, the simple act of making a call was not refurbished. I would have thought that would have been tested for before selling.
            "
"1184","This phone makes me hate IPhones all together. It shut downs all the time and I loose service half the time, mid call, mid task or all by itself.
            "
"1185","Battery life has been good, that was a big one I worried about. The phone came in great condition and I have been very happy with this purchase.
            "
"1186","We liked it very much.  It was for my husband.  He has more features than mine like WiFi calling.  The thing we haven¡¯t liked is that the speaker acts up on it and it¡¯s hard to hear him sometimes.
            "
"1187","Perfect condition!
            "
"1188","They sold me a lost phone. As soon as I activated it with my carrier I was locked out of it. It says ¡°No service¡± to where I couldn¡¯t make or receive calls or messages. I wasted my money and time calling my carrier,calling amazon, and apple. They made me come to apple just so they can tell me that the phone was reported stolen and it was replaced by the carrier. DO. NOT. BUY. FROM. HERE!!!!!!
            "
"1189","My ¡°refurbished¡± phone came with a large scratch on the glass screen!!!I would think that part of it being refurbished would have also included a CLEAN screen. Very poor judgment in thinking that it¡¯s ¡°refurbished¡±!
            "
"1190","Product arrived in time stated. It was wrapped perfectly and upon opening there were no blemishes noticed on the phone.Set up went great and is working fine so far.I ordered two of these and both work great, delivery was fast, and product looks like new.I would recommend this company for the purchase.
            "
"1191","Compre el telefono para enviarlo a Venezuela y resulta que alla el telefono no permite actualizacion en la compania telefonica me dicen que tengo que mandarlo de nuevo al comprador aun no se como resolverlo
            "
"1192","Was not compatible with Verizon
            "
"1193","We had this phone for 1day before it had problems.  It would only work intermittently.  Our carrier could not help.  We had to drive 30 min to the closest i phone store only to find that it needed a new ""logic board"".
            "
"1194","I haven¡¯t had the phone turned on yet. From what I see everything seems to be fine.
            "
"1195","The phone worked fine for 1 day..... All the sudden the screen kept flickering, turn off by itself, screen will freeze and call would suddenly drop.... Very disappointed and will never buy refurbished iPhone from Amazon..... And the return policy is awful, took too long get my money back...
            "
"1196","Returning. Within a week of receiving it, the IPhone started shutting off by itself even though the battery was full. More importantly, the Iphone had ¡ì<U+00A0>No Service<U+00A0>¡í and a warning sign next to it, making any calls and texts impossible to go trough. Except that, the Iphone was working perfectly but I could not keep it because those bugs kept coming back.
            "
"1197","I thought it was going to be an iPhone 8 but I got a 7 instead really wanted an 8 I have to use speakerphone to talk and not normal use i don¡¯t know what to do don¡¯t want to spend money on another phone
            "
"1198","No issues, like new condition. Not a scratch on it. Camera and all features working well
            "
"1199","Phone was received in great condition, no scratches or blemishes. Giving it two stars because it was not a true GSM unlocked phone and would not work with ATT so it¡¯s basically useless to me.
            "
"1200","I took this device to an Apple Store thinking that it would still be covered under the extension program for the ""Cellular Update Failed"" notification only to find out that the device was actually already a replacement given to the previous customer under the program. As a result, Apple did not repair the device and I was stuck with a useless phone. Will be returning.
            "
"1201","No funciona bien, no tenia ni el puntero para abrir donde va el chip, tire mi dinero
            "
"1202","This product is NOT Apple certified! I received a refurbished phone with an after market screen. It had touch accuracy issues and the coloring was off. I took it to the Apple store and they highly recommended returning it. I won¡¯t buy phones from amazon again.
            "
"1203","I don't usually write reviews but I just got my rose gold 7 yesterday so I don't know if it will act up or anything but so far everything is perfect. The battery life is so much better than my old android and everything is perfect, just a really small scratch on the screen but other than that everything is absolutely fine.
            "
"1204","Was very clean and easy to set up. Haven¡¯t run to a single software or hardware problem and the touch sensitivity has failed or glitches at all; total upgrade from my previous iPhone 6!
            "
"1205","I was very disappointed with my purchase. The phone was not unlocked and when I called AT&T for assistance, I found out the phone cannot be unlocked because the original owner did not pay off the phone.
            "
"1206","My phone discharge very quickly I'm very sad
            "
"1207","The phone was defective.  I needed to make an appointment with Apple & my phone was shipped off to get looked at & fixed....hardware problem.
            "
"1208","The product came with a lot of scatchs, and isnt unlocked. This is vinculated with carrier, i have some problems to work in Brasil.Now, they stopped to work all carriers. I buyed an iphone and now i have an ipod.
            "
"1209","We received this phone about 3-4 days ago. It¡¯s perfect. No scratches, issues thus far. They even sent a year warranty with the phone. It¡¯s my daughters phone as an upgrade from a 6. I have a 6s and have no complaints about my phone but am now jealous of hers. Will update if anything changes.
            "
"1210","I dont live in the US and as soln as I brought it with me to my country I tried it and you are not able to hear when you phone someone or someone phones you. I can listen to the other person.Unfortunately it is complicated for me to do anything about it. I wont buy a  refurbished cell phone again. I dont recommend it.
            "
"1211","This phone is a totally trash. The screen must be rebuilt so it is ""ghostly touch"", the keys pressed before your finger touchs the screen, and the touches are completely off too.  I could only go over the ""hello"" page but never be able to setup the region and language.  It is a shame the vendor put this on market and Amazon certified it is working as new!!
            "
"1212","I had an issue with my iPhone and they were quick to solve it to my satisfaction
            "
"1213","The thing that I don¡¯t like is the camera shutter sound. I¡¯ve tried different ways to silence it and nothing works.  Now I know it¡¯s a product made in Japan where it¡¯s illegal to not have a camera shutter sound. And there¡¯s no way of silencing it.
            "
"1214","This was a really good phone! I bought it becuase my old one was broken and I didn't want to get a new one. Everything was perfect, except for when it arrived, there was a scratch at the top of the screen. It did not affect anything too much, so overall, the battery, touch screen, and everything else was perfect.
            "
"1215","Touch screen to censative turns on when I put it in my pocket
            "
"1216","The phone works well, has good battery life, and looks pretty clean. I've only had it for a couple months. So we'll see how it does for the next year or so.
            "
"1217","The item was sold by ELECTRONIC DEALS and had multiple problems: microphone, backlight, usb port...overall the product looks as new, but it doesn't work as new. Screen was replaced with cheap 3rd party replacement kit by someones crooked hands. Disappointed, had to return the product.
            "
"1218","Phone is in great physical shape, however, we need to take it to an apple store to have it looked over because it does not work for phone calls or texts unless you are on wifi.  Brought it to our verizon store and they said this model has a tendency to act this way???  So, we should take it to an apple store, nearest one is an hour away, and have them look at it.  So frustrating!!
            "
"1219","Advertised to be unlocked. Did not work on Verizon network. Took a while to receive refund.
            "
"1220","I bought this phone and I put my AT&T SIM card in. My SIM is working btw. So I put it in the new phone and it works for a little, then all of a sudden it goes to no service or searching. But it works fine when i put it in my old phone. Does anyone have this problem? Really don¡¯t feel like going to the hassle of returning.
            "
"1221","Phone is in excellent shape, looks like brand new and works great, so far, the only problem I¡¯ve had with it is that the speaker sounds somewhat shot, other than that, great purchase
            "
"1222","Not working not unlocked
            "
"1223","The phone itself was great. Returned it before use as it was a gift and they already had bought one
            "
"1224","Too soon to know too much about it, but so far, so good.
            "
"1225","I is a nice phone but the battery life is weak and it gets real hot when charging.slight scratch on screen that I can barely see but screen fine besides that. I would like a replacement
            "
"1226","I was very scared at first because of previous reviews, but then I stepped out on faith and My daughter got this phone for her 15th birthday and she is in love with it!

"1228","This is my first Iphone, very happy I Purchased it... Great Phone, Easy to use....
            "
"1229","So I just got my IPhone 7 and it seems to be good and all, the only thing I was like ""wait this is wrong"" was the charger's adapter (the thing you plug in the wall) so it's a Huawei adapter and it's black doesn't even match with the cable's color, which is white. Am I just going to have to buy an iPhone adapter or what?
            "
"1230","Home button will not open the first page. The sleep button will open the first page and then the home button will open the desktop screen.
            "
"1231","When I brought this device it didn¡¯t work properly. Struggled to keep connection and all. Even when I put a case over it the singal got very weak and caused me to suffer for months. Also, it power cycles ALOT ( turns off and on) it¡¯s probably foreign objects inside the device so trust me when I say don¡¯t trust or buy from here.
            "
"1232","<U+00A0>I just received with this phone with this problem at screen.
            "
"1233","I've been using this phone for about a month and so far there hasn't been any major problems about the phone. One minor problem is when I put the phone on silence and take a picture, the shutter sound is still loud. As if it isn't on silence. All in all this phone works as if you bought it from the apple store.
            "
"1234","When i first got the phone, it was working fine for a few days and then there was ""No Service."" It said ""Cellular Update Failed"" and i tried everything from restarting, remove and insert sim card again, and to factory reset nothing works! Good thing the warranty is still on. Don't waste your time buying from here.
            "
"1235","Came in right on time, had minimal wear just a few tiny paint scratches on the top right corner nothing too bad. Came in well packaged but didn't come in original box. It's fully functional for me at the moment
            "
"1236","Great shape, looks almost like new. I'm happy with the phone. Works fine, great price great phone! only thing is the charger isn't original and it says ""not supported"" when I plug it in. Other than that totally recommend phone.
            "
"1237","What is this. Before I even turned it on it looks terrible. It was said that there was minimal to no wear but look at the pictures.
            "
"1238","I ordered this phone and it says it¡¯s unlocked but it¡¯s not so now I have to find out how to unlock it because it is reported stolen. When I got this phone it was scratched grout he screen and from the side. And the front camera is not working how it should. I got lied to and now I have to waste more money to fix it
            "
"1239","Refurbished phone looks and works like new. All data from old phone transferred perfectly.
            "
"1240","It was great! the phone came inside a small zip lock bag to try to vacuum seal it as much they can which was great. The phone turned on well and setting it up was easy enough. The phone has been working amazing so far and I would recommend to buy.
            "
"1241","No compren, el telefono de repente pierde senal, intente restaurar  y me sale error menos unos -1. Leon en foros que puede ser la placa. Don't  buy, the  last  day  the  iphone don't catcht signal, i tried  to flash  with itunes  and  send me an erro  -1. I cant do anything  with  the iPhone.  In from  Paraguay.

            "
"1244","very happy
            "
"1245","The first day I got it my phone would shut up with every phone call and overheat. The only time I could talk on the phone was when I had a headset in!!! I tried getting in contact with the person who sold the phone twice but I response!
            "
"1246","Everything was great with this phone! Up until I got my first phone call....(maybe not even half a day of having it) and the speakers didn¡¯t work.. neither did the microphone... sadly I returned it and got a full refund! Very great phone overall but maybe do a more in-depth check
            "
"1247","Phone was in great condition and even for a refurbished phone battery health was at 98% will buy again

"1257","Good
            "
"1258","I was able to just take it to the Verizon store, it was fully unlocked. This was my birthday present and it works very well. There really isn¡¯t anything wrong with it in my opinion execpt the battery life is pretty short in my opinion but I¡¯m also a teenage girl who is almost always on their phone.
            "
"1259","I hope anybody buy phone in this business,  my iphone died in 10 months, that really bad product
            "
"1260","It doesn't work at all!!
            "
"1261","I am so happy with my new phone! The phone arrival was delayed by Hurricane Harvey, but it got here in a box, with a generic charger and a generic cable. The phone is practically new, no noticeable big scratches. I activated it with a GSM carrier and I had no problem (although the tag in the back said it was used with Verizon before, which scared me at the beginning... but it's nice to know that I could use it with a CDMA carrier if I want to). Touch screen and pressure sensor work. I have had it for about a week and a half, so I will post an update in a few months.  This is the first apple product I buy off of Amazon as a certified refurbished device and it is great! Sad that the Iphone 7 does not have a headphone jack (which has nothing to do with the seller or the service, just a general comment)...
            "
"1262","Took the phone to a great repair place they said that a bad LCD was put into the phone. Working had to pay to get it fixed
            "
"1263","Works like brand new, was expecting something wrong with the screen or battery or the phone itself being slow but it works as if i had just bought it from the apple store. Amazing quality!
            "
"1264","The phone came in perfect conditions. No scratches or dents. It works like brand new with no software or hardware issues. Delivery was also faster than expected. The only thing is it doesn¡¯t come with an authentic charger but besides that, i recommend buying this product.
            "
"1265","Nice phone for the great Price! Love it
            "
"1266","I love this iPhone 7.. I save so much money just getting a used one that look new and smell new ... and it¡¯s unlocked so I can have any cellphone company with this it¡¯s the best !!!
            "
"1267","Had the phone for a month now works great,, the only thing is, it¡¯s a little low on the volume when talking on the phone, but it¡¯s not a major problem I would still recommend
            "
"1268","I love my phone. I was so surprised to see how well it worked. 10/10.
            "
"1269","Hey guys, Iam a normal guy looking for an affordable phone. I saw this and was skeptical but decided to get it. I Am really shocked that it actually worked despite the one stars on the review. Amazon knows what's up and id like to say thanks for actually distributing an almost brand new phone. I encourage people to buy one :)
            "
"1270","I love it I needed an upgrade from my iPhone 6(16 gb) silver I love my iPhone 7 rose gold and matches my Apple Watch rose gold I highly recommend this seller to buy or gift to someone who loves apple products

            "

            "
"1273","I love my purchase, I don't regret at all. phone was received in moderate timing, love the fact that the package was huge but my device was protected. I receive a free tempered glass and also 2 free screen protectors. I gave this 4 stars due to the fact that I believe earpods should've been included with the purchase. but overall the phone was in great condition for a refurbished iPhone 7 and I've had the phone for 3 weeks and it still is functional, I have nth bad to say.also the seller was very interactive in ensuring my satisfaction by following up.
            "
"1274","Phone came quickly - two scratches on screen were essentially unnoticeable.  I have worked it over, restored from backup, added new music.  All functions work great.  Very satisfied.  Refurbished was an excellent choice.
            "
"1275","This product had amazing description. It was supposed to be certified refurbished.But that did not hold true. It had million scratches on the screen. Battery was draining so quick that i had to charge it 5-6 times a day.
            "
"1276","Phone runs like a champ, no problems with it at all. Definitely would recommend this to friends and family
            "

"1282","Good phone. Worth iut
            "
"1283","2 hours of charging heats up the phone a lot but this phone is 100% worth the money
            "
"1284","Worked great, looked almost brand new. I could't find any marks on it. Several weeks so far with no problems. Was easy as a T-mobile member.
            "
"1285","It works well and haven't had any problems yet but I deopped it and instead of breaking it seems to have indented which makes me think that the screen is made of something other than glass but other than that its good.
            "
"1286","This is a review about the quality of the delivered phone, not the experience.The phone was delivered in excellent condition, with an actual apple charger, with no blemishes.Really can't be beat for the price! Will update in the future.
            "
"1287","Good
            "
"1288","This phone was great until I put my SIM card in and it kept saying no service. I did everything the internet told me to do and nothing to fix it. I guess that¡¯s what I get for ordering another phone off amazon
            "
"1289","The iPhone  does not come in the original Apple box; the accessories are not original (cable e charger). The appearance is of a well-used cell phone. I do not recommend! I just did not return because I traveled to Brazil and did not have time to return.
            "
"1290","So far, the iphone is working perfectly. No scratches, like new. It works with my t-mobile sim card. There is a little issue I will figure out with the seller. The phone gets very hot quickly. Not sure if this is normal or is just this phone. I will update the post soon.
            "
"1291","Phone works great only thing that was bad was I had 2 day shipping and it took a whole week also the picture has a iphone box charger and headphones but I got only a plain white box with no headphones only charger overall love the product
            "
"1292","the Phone itself looked great and everything works as it should. That being said! the battery life was only 75% so it needs to be placed on the charger throughout the day. for the price paid it should have been much better
            "
"1293","They gave me a bad phone it wasn¡¯t unlocked at all !!
            "
"1294","Horrible phone, your better off paying $100 more & buying a brand new 1 from the Apple store, internet never worked on the road, at 1st we thought the problem was the phone provider, until v changed the chip to another phone, daily we had switch off & switch on the phone for the internet part to work.

"1298","The sound messed up on this approximately 2 weeks after I got it.  It's all static and garbled so no one can hear what I say.  I have to use speaker phone and that doesn't even help much.  I had it in a lifeproof case from the moment I opened it so nothing at all happened to the phone.  It was screwed up from the beginning.  Refurbished is a joke.  Don't buy APPLE's refurbished equipment!  IT'S BROKEN!!!  Wasted a LOT of money.

"1471","This product looks great and turns on, but it was completely missing the sim card tray. Luckily, Apple is able to order me one, but with an extra cost. So far I am not convinced that this is a reliable supplier. Hopefully, I will be pleasantly surprised about how well it works, but so far I would look elsewhere.

This phone is a keeper!It came with a power adapter and cable.Also, I received this phone within 2 days - that was a big bonus.  I am very happy with everything about this transaction.

"1749","""Earpods not included.""Yes, now I see that at the end of the small letters text, they actually do note that on the product page. Let's just say after going through dozens of refurbished iPhone pages reading small script is not big on my list. ""Earpods not included"" not being more obviously stated on the page (in bold, or at least first thing in the description) is my only complain though. The iPhone itself was in good condition, which IS the most important thing. It would be a five star review if I did not feel somewhat cheated by (and embarrassed for not noticing) the small print tricks. But I guess everybody uses those nowadays, so it's ok, right?Update: The phone turned out to be locked! After several months when I took it out of the country and tried using it with another operator it does not work because apparently it is still locked.

I was figuring this issue was with my phone service, so I went to the cricket store, they input my sim card into a different phone but the same exact brand and it worked. I am highly upset I paid a little over $700 for a phone that does not work with my carrier as listed.

"1809","The price seems alright compare to others, but this is not prime meaning it¡¯s not handle by amazon.. I bought this thinking it was a prime but it didn¡¯t arrive in two days it was about 3 days. Not a big deal but if you have a prime and you bought a prime item you expected it to arrived in two days.. as you can see in the photos, nothing like new. Scratches and the SIM card slot was put in improper way as they had no time or so. I opened up the phone and it started to warm up like it had been used for gaming or something hard. The worst part is when I try to changed and open the package, it came with Samsung charger... definitely didn¡¯t care much about their items. Last of all I thought I could return it like any other primes and nope I was wrong I had to paid for the shipping for return which I don¡¯t think about buying stuff when it¡¯s labeled as prime product. Would give zero but there is not an option.
            "
"1810","But not one but two iPhone 7 from electro wireless and they both had the same problem. The cellular data connectivity was an issue and always left the phone when I turned off the WiFi so I had to reset the phone afterwards every time. I returned the first one and had the same issue with the second one. I tried everything I could think of even contacting my network provider but I didn¡¯t have this issue with my iPhone 5s which still works. Everything else works well but this is two big off an issue to ignore.
            "
"1811","EXTREMELY disappointed with iphone 7 and apple's approach to the product fix. Phone never worked as promised - searching for service, not receiving texts, not able to get online and not able to make calls. Struggled with this device for over a year, blaming operator error and service provider. Recently, found out the issue has been a logic board problem all along ... ever hear of the word 'recall'???? Disappointed that apple did not notify as I never imagined the device was a lemon. Wasted time troubleshooting and money on a data plan that was used intermittently.
            "
"1812","I purchased the black iPhone 7 32GB unlocked from chubbiestech and was very pleased with the results. Everything is in like new condition, and it even came with the apple charger.

"1813","My son purchased this to replace the contract phone that he broke beyond the ability to repair.  We have experienced none of the issues others have mentioned in their reviews.  The phone was in good condition, unlocked, and not tied to anyone's Apple account.  Would definitely purchase again.
            "
"1814","It came with more than I've expected... 3 years ago, I bought a refurbished iPhone 5s on Groupon, it came only the charger and the phone, not even the sim card removal tool... It was a good phone, unfortunately, I've lost it. Now I bought this iPhone 7 and it came already with a tempered glass protector, a car charger, the sim card removal tool and a case. I'm really happy with my new phone. Thank you!
            "
"1815","Really fast, reliable and cool. The only problem is the battery life. But if you don't use too much push alerts, it really last all day long.
            "
"1816","I think that because it doesn't come in original packaging its not giftable also based on other reviews the quality is not consistent some might be good and bad. I got a good one but the next time i buy it i might get a bad one

"1817","I¡¯ve had the phone for a couple days now and there have been no problems with compatibility issues with at&t, calling, or anything else. The battery does go down at a increased rate but the phone is still worth it for the price. It came in with no scratches and looks in perfect condition.

The screen is perfect, there were two very small areas of dent/scratches in the body of the phone by two corners. The camera works perfectly from what I can tell so far. It works with my carrier Ting. I am very pleased and think that this is a great value!
            "
"1833","Being that this item is refurbished I waited a while to write the review to see how it hold out after a couple of weeks.  I have to say I am very pleased with this product.  The phone looks pristine and it worked without any falls.  I took it to my phone company and they did not have the slightest problem, it was unlock as it supposed to be.  If this company is taking the time to make sure this phone is presentable and works properly, they are doing a great job to please their customers.  For those reading this review, I hope my case is not the exception.  The one complain however; which I thought it was silly on the company's part, was that the charger.  It is junk.  It looks good and new but it did not charge the phone at a normal speed which tells me it does not have the specs the phone needs to charge properly.  When I used my old charger, the phone fully charges in an hour.  I had it with their charger for over two hours and barely made it to 70%.
            "
"1834","I had purchased this iPhone 7 in September 2018 from this supplier.  The phone was working ok for 6 months, but now it will not turn on and is completely dead.  We have tried all ways to hard reboot/reset the phone, but it seems completely unresponsive.  I called Amazon, who followed their procedure and contacted the original vendor TheCellCo.  They were not willing to do anything about it and neither was Amazon A-Z.So the lesson to note about these refurbished phones is that you take a big bet buying from firms like ""TheCellCo"".  Not only do we not know what was refurbished, but the warranty is pretty lame.  I read a few reviews that folks believe that these phones non-OEM parts from China replaced in them and this is likely the cause of the dead motherboard.  While I do not really know what is the cause, I do know that this is a $400 purchase that didn't pay off when we got it and now we are left with a device that is useless.
            "
"1835","I am very happy with my reconditioned phone. Although the battery health rating is only 98%. Other than that everything is working well and it was in perfect condition. No scratches at all. Fingers crossed that it will keep on working. The price for the 256GB was the best I found. Shipment was super fast. Thank you! I am a happy customer.

"1836","Looks like new , carrier unlocked, was overheating at first but didn¡¯t experience any issue after a software update.

"1837","I was nervous about getting an iPhone this way, because the reviews seemed pretty split: a lot of five stars, but a lot of one stars. I decided to take the risk, and got the iPhone 7 for my wife. It's been about two months since she started using it, and we have had NO problems! This review is really just to share my experience with getting a refurbished one here, since you can find reviews for iPhones in other places, with a lot more information.Bottom line, this was a great deal, we had no issues, and if/when I need to get another phone in the future, I'm going to go this route again.
            "
"1838","1) The phone had a screen protector on it when I received it. Screen protectors don¡¯t go well with otter boxes, the case that I use.2) The battery was at 90% capacity when I recurved it. I took it into Apple to get it replaced before their battery price increase. They said if there were any non-Apple hardware in it (common of third-party sellers of used iPhones) they would not be able to repair it. Thankfully, there was only apple hardware.3) Three months after buying this phone the microphone stopped picking up sound. Making the phone unusable for its most basic function, phone calls. To fix this problem would have cost me about the same to buy the phone.I ended up replacing this phone after having if for three months.
            "
"1839","phone works great and was in great condition. Didn't receive any cables or accessories with it.There IS a shutter sound when you take a picture EVERY SINGLE TIME (my older model muted this if it was in silent mode, but not the case on this phone). If you use this primarily for photography, particularly in public, this might be annoying to you! Saw another reviewer had commented on this but I purchased anyway, almost wish that I hadn't, as it annoys me more than I thought it would.

"1841","Bought this phone so I could use it in Korea with a local SIM and because I need to return my primary phone to the manufacturer for a warranty repair for ~30 days and wanted to use it as a backup when I returned to the US. Not sure exactly what the inspection process is as far as ""renewing"" or refurbishing, but the SIM card reader was unable to locate a SIM (tried with several working SIM cards from different carriers & tried the new SIM in other phones without any issues). As if that wasn't disappointing enough, the battery would quickly drain (within ~2-3 hours) *EVEN WHEN THE DEVICE WAS TURNED OFF*. Amazon tech service was unable to sort out the issue and when they put me in touch with Apple, we literally could not get them to pick up the phone for >30 minutes. I'll try another Amazon-supported unlocked iPhone once I get my return credit and I'm hoping the inspection is a bit more thorough this time. I'm also bummed I spent ~$100 in prepaid SIM cards that I have never able to use.

"1842","The refurb had a replacement screen and 84% battery health. The body was 9/10 with only one very small ding in the bottom right corner, which is paint matched and unnoticeable unless you're looking for it. You can tell the screen isn't the original when holding it up to a new iphone 7 and diagnostics confirms that. The screen and 84% battery health knocks off at least two stars.
            "
"1843","This was an amazing deal. I got the black iPhone with 260 gigs. You. Can¡¯t even tell it¡¯s refurbished.  There is a tiny scratch on the to of the phone but you can¡¯t even really tell with it being black. The screen is perfect. So small scratches or blimishes. It¡¯s running smoothly and so far the battery life is like a new phone. If I didn¡¯t know that this phone was refurbished I would have never guessed.  This is a must buy. I¡¯m on cricket and it¡¯s working like a charm. I switched from using android and have been using one for years it¡¯s going to take a little bit to get use to but that has nothing to do with the phone itself.
            "
"1844","I got a refurbished gold iPhone 7 with 128 GB of flash memory from ElectroWireless.I would recommend anyone to buy a refurbished iPhone. The iPhone I got come on time, and showed very little signs of use. Everything works: touch ID, front and read cameras, facetime, WiFi, Bluetooth, and 4G on T-Mobile (GSM).The only thing I did not like was that I got the phone with a battery health around 82%. It can still hold a whole day of usage without problem, but I think the page description should state that the battery might not be a new one.
            "
"1845","This was the 4th iPhone I bought, used, online (2 thru Amazon, 2 elsewhere).  All 4 had problems.  This one was hard to see thru the screen and entering any data was problematic.  A refund was given immediately by the seller.  Somebody dropped the ball when the OK'd this one for resale.  I would use the seller again tho.
            "
"1846","I love my phone. Shipping didn¡¯t take long at all. So far I have not had any issues with the phone. It can be used with Straight Talk and was easy to get connected. It was in great condition and I have no complaints.
            "
"1847","Stay away from this seller.  Selling junk refurbished phones that will stop working after their 90 day warranty.  All the other reviews are true.  Find another refurbish phone seller that is honest and stands behind their product.  Seller refused to make any amends or even meet halfway on the  Iphone that is now is completely useless.  Apple store stated they used inferior parts to fix the phone.
            "
"1848","My first purchase of a refurbished phone on Amazon and wow, what a disappointment.  The device screen is heavily scratched.  The description states ""like new"", when in fact this looks nothing like new.  A few minor issues would be reasonable.  I have 3-4 year old phones that look way better than this.  The back has a weird film over it full of smudges and discoloration.  The screen flickers when you press the home key.  There is a space between the top of the screen and casing with what appears to be adhesive.  The volume on/off switch on the side has dirt on it.  The advertisement says GSM unlocked but the sticker on the back says Verizon.  I don't have Verizon.  I didn't even try the SIM card, returning immediately.
            "
"1849","What was Apple thinking with this phone? No headphone jack? You have to use bluetooth headphones? (try not to die when you see what Apple charges for those...) It's the same size as the iPhone 6, but less functional without the headphone jack. Would it have killed them to leave it there and still include bluetooth listening? No. No it wouldn't have. Not my favorite ""upgrade"" that Apple has ever put out.
            "
"1850","Excellent condition externally. Battery was at 90% life. Decided to have the apple store put in a new battery for $29 (special limited time pricing).  Tests by Apple store showed the compass failed tests, all else OK.  We submitted it for new battery. 3 hours later, at pickup, we were told display was not original and hence had been replaced ($150 value). Fyi it seemed fully functional. Apple was kind to waive the extra charge.
            "
"1851","I don¡¯t know why their are so many negative reviews about this phone. I received it in great condition, and then I took it to AT&T, and they put in my SIM card, and I was done. Works like new. I love the phone!
            "
"1852","I just purchased this phone for my teenaged son's birthday.  I already had a sim card from a previous upgrade whereas I did not use the card.  I inserted the sim card, went through all the steps, and everything worked exactly as promised.  The phone is pristine, with the most minor of evidence of previous use.
            "
"1853","You never know what your going to get when ordering online, but I was so  ecstatic to find out that this phone is amazing. It came in good condition.  Are you still have a plus but I switch down to the regular and it¡¯s just perfect pets in my hand I got the Jack Black its beautiful. Haven¡¯t had any problems, and it shows no wear. I plugged in my T-Mobile Sims card and it worked.
            "
"1854","Great phone for a great price. Why get an iPhone Xs that¡¯s 3 steps behind Samsung Galaxy S10 when you can get an IPhone 7 with 256 gigs and do the same thing as an IPhone 10.
            "
"1855","This is like a new phone, except it still has it's original battery, which is at 82 %, but it holds up a lot longer than my old Iphone 6 with a new battery. The advantage of water resistance is great, which is good if you golf or are outdoors a lot. The 6 is not. You will need to get an adapter to use it with wired headphones. Again it is like a new phone with no scratches on the screen or the body. Everything works very well.
            "
"1856","Touchscreen failed at first startup.  Clearly was not tested adequately. Returned.  Disappointed a family member I gave it to as a gift.

"1857","I¡¯m very happy with this certified refurbished phone.
            "
"1858","Verizon would not accept this phone....we were told it did not match their company numbers to activate. My son swears the description said it was Verizon compatible......NOT. Be careful when ordering that your cell service provider will accept the phone....we had to send it back.
            "
"1859","I bought this iPhone 2days ago and so far I have had no real bad problems. The battery life is average and it works just like new. Although occasionally the screen will freeze and I¡¯m nervous that in the future it will break. If you want a nice phone on a  budget (like me) then I do recommend this <U+0001F44D>Also side note it came with everything in the box (not real apple box, just shipping box) except headphones.
            "
"1860","I bought this phone for my teen son. It has been unusable for 4 out of 5 months. It says NO SERVICE or SEARCHING FOR SERVICE constantly. All troubleshooting has been done. Apple Store wants $319 for out-of-warranty repair. So, it's only use is for web browsing since he can only connect to the Internet. DISAPPOINTED!
            "
"1861","Phone was exactly as described. Also arrived on timeCustomer service communication was excellent.I would recommend Chubbiestech to other customers andthanks again Karen.

"1864","I¡¯ve have the iPhone 7 for about two weeks now. I must say I¡¯m pretty impressed with the ease of using the phone, the battery life, and the overall experience with the phone.

"1867","Came in great condition, I couldn¡¯t even tell it was a refurb. Everything was as expected, and has worked perfectly since I bought it (about 2 months ago). The only thing to think about when you buy this is that they don¡¯t include the thunderbolt headphones<U+2014>which they tell you in the description, however, if you¡¯re like me, you¡¯ll forget and be really disappointed the first time you go to plug in your headphones. So just remember- if you buy this, either buy the thunderbolt headphones or get the adaptor cable for normal headphones.

            "
"1870","The phone arrived in great working condition with one small dent on the back. After one year the microphone broke which is somewhat common with iPhone 7. The audio IC card needs work now which will cost me about 125 to fix.

"1985","The product is great. It came in perfect conditions. Included screen protector, charger and charging box. The price is resonable but as of turning it on and using it for a week. I have only come across two issues.1) The touch sensitivity is a little off. For example i can never get the iphone control center to come up while im on an App. When im on the home screen it seems to work fast. But if im on an App it glitches and just doesnt want to come up.2) The Speakers! Im not sure if the parts the company that refurbishes it used are genuine Apple parts. When I want to use the speakers on full volume or even close to full volume they have really bad feedback. The sound is scratchy and unattractive. It just doesnt sound like a new untouched iphone would sound.

"1994","My new iPhone is in great condition and I¡¯m super happy with it. came with no scratches or dents, and seems to be in perfect condition. Searched around for a refurbished iPhone for a while and am very glad I went with this company :)

"1996","This is a very fine phone. Truly the best I've ever had. Of course the lack of earphones input is disappointing and even inconvenient but outside of that it's a great phone.
            "
"1997","* Update the phone is not working. Straightalk is telling me the phone is locked. Apple wont help because its refurbished. Waiting on the seller to contact me. It's been a frustrating 48 hours. Will update again based on the response from the seller.Arrived just as described. I'm using this phone on  straightalk. It is not compatible with the AT&T SIM card so I did have to buy a new SIM and switch it over to T Mobile SIM but it works perfectly after we figured out the SIM issue.
            "
"1998","Actually felt kind of disappointed, although the phone works just fine it came with non-original accesories such as an ZTE charger & cable without any headphones or lightning-to-plug cable. I had to buy all these in the Apple store paying more than $50. If I knew this, probably I wouldn't have bought a refurbished phone & would have just bought it brand new at Apple store. My insatisfaction comes by the lack of information, when I buy a ""Certified Refurbished"" product I expect to find it just as if it was brand new, I've done this with other products & received the same presentation kit as if it was from the brand store, while this phone got to my hands in a plain white box which isn't the original one. Perhaps, if I knew this before purchasing the product, I would have chosen other supplier or wouldn't have bought the product.

"1999","works great
            "
"2000","with much skepticism after reading many negative reviews, i purchased this phone. It arrived ontime as promised, the phone came well packaged. the phone looks brand new, no scratches or dents or dings. all the functions worked properly. I had zero issues with my service provider activating the unlocked phone. it came with all the items stated. my husband loves the phone, and I love the price!
            "
"2001","The phone had a few scratches on its screen, and I guess when I think refurbished, I think ""fixed"", in more than just turning on. Oh, well. It worked out fine. Till I sold it for the infinitely more wonderful Google Pixel 2.

"2017","I have boycotted Apple products for almost forty years, but ""not no more!"" I love this little turd.It's a shame that I choose to hide its museum quality design with a case and an extra layerof tempered glass, bit I will be dropping it, and often.

"2023","I want to say one thing, if you're selling subpar equipment, people are not going to buy from you! And check your reviews they're not the best. So remember if you're not selling a good piece of equipment it's not worth being on Amazon.

            "
"2041","ever since I got this phone it has not worked properly. It does not connect to wifi, and even if it does nothing works. You cannot get calls and the cellular data works slowwwwww. It has been a pain to me. I cannot do nothing with my phone.
            "
"2042","Despite bad reviews, it set up easily and worked well. All iphones don't have the best battery life, so I won't necessarily count that against it. Overall, a great purchase.
            "
"2043","I received the defective phone on the board that inviabiized the microphone and I can not use the phone for its main function that is to speak. I Wanted to know how to return it and get my money back. I Bought the device for delivery in the U.S.A. but brought to Brazil that's where I live. Now I'll have an extra charge to remit the device back.
            "
"2044","I like that the product comes with all the features the normal brand new iPhone 7 comes with. Something I dislike is the battery died unusually fast and that is frustrating when out without a charger.
            "
"2045","ordered black but received rose gold. heavy damage to the back of the phone, charging port, and speaker grills. battery health was 80%. I returned this item immediately and will not be re-ordering
