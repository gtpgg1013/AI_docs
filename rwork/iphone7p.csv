"1","This phone is awesome! It came 2 days EARLY and it came with a charger and it came with 38% charge! Now, I read like 100 reviews that it wasn't unlocked, let me clear ALL that up, this phone IS GSM UNLOCKED meaning if you use a service provider such as Metro PCS or T- Mobile or other GSM service providers, this phone will work! Now if you use CDMA network( Sprint/Verizon) it might not work but that is not this seller's fault because VERY CLEARLY STATED in the product description this is a GSM unlocked phone. So don't buy it and expect it to work with CDMA Network and then write a bad review when it doesn't. This phone is certified refurbished through Amazon and it is like a brand new iPhone! Also, if you're switching from 6plus or 6s and below keep in mind that the 7 and up don't have a home ""button"" per say.. like it doesn't push in so the home button is not broken it just doesn't make that clicking sound the older phones make.
            "
"2","No wear or tear at all. Packages nicely, and seems to work as new. Will update.
            "
"3","The phone was packaged nicely and phone was in excellent condition. Phone was GSM unlocked which made it very easy to set my service up on it (MetroPCS). Only thing I didn¡¯t like was it did not come with headphones. Still 5 stars tho!
            "
"4","Fast delivery and arrived in perfect shape.  Two differences between this and a new iPHone... The Cost!  and the word Refurbished.Update... have now bought 3 of them and all were and still are perfect.
            "
"5","The phone is physically fine. It has a software glitch. The screen freezes and might not work for a hour or 2 and starts working. All I want is another phone because I understand things happen. They will not exchange it. 2 phone calls later they said they are sending me return info. 3 days later I have not received it. Do not order from this company. They are 70 dollars more directly from apple and you have no problems. Now I am stuck with a 500 piece of junk.
            "
"6","Product was delivered as promised in excellent packaging.  Phone was in excellent condition and worked beautifully right away.  Easy to activate without SIM card!  Nice purchase!
            "
"7","When i received my iPhone e7 plus rose gold, it was fine for about two weeks... but now it shuts off randomly, and when i take videos they look green as well as when i watch them. i wouldnt recommend buying this product.
            "
"8","This is an amazing  phone there was no scratches or dents I couldn¡¯t believe it was refurbished.It only comes with a charger no EarPods or headphone adapter but that¡¯s fine sense the adapter is $9.Does not come in original box it comes in the sellers box with their branding on it.Their was nothing wrong with the battery it lasts the whole day.I don¡¯t know why people gave bad reviews as this product was in excellent condition and ran amazing so if your thinking about getting this phone get it.
            "
"9","I just received my I phone 7 Plus and the phone do not look refurbished it looks like a brand new phone I am very satisfied with my purchase and I ordered my phone 4 days ago and it came in the mail today it¡¯s definitely worth the price and I transferred my old sim into the phone and it is now able to make calls . I recommend purchasing this phone if you want a great buy.
            "
"10","Review #1 - You take a real chance when you buy a refurbished iPhone. I agonized about this decision, but I also didn't want to spend $1000 on a brand new model to replace my old iPhone 5c.  After doing some research, I selected this 7 Plus from MyWit (seller). The phone arrived via Fedex and was securely packaged. Note, it was NOT in an original Apple box (not an issue for me). They included a cable and charger adapter.  The phone was unlocked as advertised and I had no issues whatsoever connecting to MetroPCS or transferring my data from my old iPhone.  Thus far, I am very happy w/purchase and everything is working as advertised. The phone looks and operates as new.  However, I'm only giving 4 stars right now, because of course iPhone issues don't always arise immediately.  I plan to update this review over the next few weeks for those considering.
            "
"11","for a certified reconditioned phone I am impressed. No dents or scratches and the battery wear level was 3%. Everything works very well. I got stuck with the finger id during setup. Well all i had to do was peel off the plastic cover they put on phone screen which was satisfying to do for some reason. It work very well after that.  I would recommend.
            "
"12","Had this phone for about 4 weeks then it stopped working suddenly and said no service. I have tmobile and it its ""GSM unlocked"" so I dont understand When I looked up the imei it said that my phone was blocked/reported lost/stolen  This is so disappointing because I actually liked the phone. I submitted a return request and contacted the seller. I feel defrauded. Waste of time and money
            "
"13","To be honest, I just received this phone today (which arrived two days early). I inspected the phone and it looks like it hasn¡¯t ever been touched. I thought it was too good to be true. I set up the iPhone and put in a SIM card from an old android I had... still worked perfectly. I had to do NOTHING extra. Literally put in my Apple ID and old SIM card and I was golden. Perfect condition, fast shipping, everything working.... just beautiful. If anything oddly happens, I will be sure to update, but so far, so awesome!!!!
            "
"14","This phone is awesome it works really well my iPhone 6 Plus just gave up on me one day and quit charging or turning on so I had to find a replacement quick and I don¡¯t have 1,000$ to go buy a brand new X model so I did some research and this phone has a lot of bang for your buck it¡¯s features are a little different with no headphone jack and the home button doesn¡¯t press down but I love the phone it¡¯s like having my 6 but an upgraded version of it lol either way I¡¯m content the package arrived just as planned no scratches or damages and I had to contact the seller and amazon with this order and both got back to me within minutes! So iam very pleased with the whole order experience and I¡¯m loving my new phone!
            "
"15","This is not bad but it doesn't come with headphones and it comes with Verizon charger. I am kind of disappointed. But fortunately the phone is not fake. I could have the phone,earphones and charger on Apple official website for only $30 more.
            "
"16","Horrible product, shuts down completely after 2 weeksDONT WASTE YOUR TIME, I DIDNT HEAVE THE WARNINGS, BUT YOU SHOULD
            "
"17","It stopped working on its own without even touching it. I am returning it back to the seller. Thank you.
            "
"18","To be quite honest, I was scared to purchase this product. Looking through the reviews and seeing broken and missing phones was quite unsettling. Although, I gave this product the benefit of the doubt. So I bought it and once I recieved it, I was extremely pleased. The phone had no scratches or scrapes on any part. The responsiveness is quick and works extremely well. The battery is surprisingly good considering this phone is certified refurbished. The only complaint I have with this phone is that the camera quality is only okay. Although I highly doubt that that has anything to do with Amazon or the company it was shipped from. Also, the shipping came a day early!! All in all, this phone is great and I will see how the phone handles within the next few weeks.
            "
"19","The phone was in ¡°like new¡± condition which was fantastic. The battery power was also like new. I received iPhone insurance as well which was a pleasant surprise! I would have given 5 stars but I didn¡¯t receive an adapter for the headphones and had to buy one at the apple store.
            "
"20","I wish I could return this phone, the camera stopped working two months ago. It works more like a counterfeit not original iPhone
            "
"21","I love what I received. It brand new phone with awesome packaging. It not with iPhone box but it said it goes through amazon so yes it said as it description.
            "
"22","I was sceptical at first, I read reviews upon reviews and had in my intention that if no signs of what the description says I would instantly demand refund. To my surprise my bday gift to myself was excellent....the look feel everything about the phone- from the packaging to the product- was perfect
            "
"23","Y¡¯all... lemme tell you that I didn¡¯t read the description all the way through at first until AFTER I had bought it. I was freaking out. I had an oldiPhone 6. Yes I know dinasour old. I was so excited that I was constantly through out the day looking for it to be delivered. Then when I read the description all the way through I realized it said GSM unlocked and not full carrier unlocked. I was freaking out super worried I was going to have to spend more time trying to send it back to get another one. I PUT MY SIM CARD IN AND IT WORKS TOTALLY FINE! I freaked myself out for nothing. I have Verizon and I was super worried it wouldn¡¯t work because I had googled if GSM unlocked was the same as fully unlocked and they aren¡¯t.
            "
"24","ONLY by this phone if you like wasting money. Do not take the risk of buying this phone from Amazon. Just save up a few extra bucks and get an official one from apple. Much safer. The phone I recieved has a battery that can barely last up to 3 hours and thats when IM Not using it. when you use it it dies much faster. It takes decades to charge up however the battery will go down in minutes.its so annoying having to practically keep my phone on the charger all day. its super glitchy sometimes the phone presses things on its own. Sometimes i cant even use it because of how glithcy it is! this is absolutely the WORST phone ive ever had. A flip phone would be better than buyinjg this crap
            "
"25","The iPhone was like new! I love it. It's all setup and running smoothly, I'm very happy.
            "
"26","The phone was appeared in good condition. There were no scratches or blemishes. I noticed that the 5, t and c keys ¡°stuck¡± sometimes but that just made me more observant when I typed. When I tried to power it off, I had a hard time swipping. Then later I could not swipe to answer a call. After doing a reset to factory settings it still didn¡¯t work. I couldn¡¯t even get it to shut down in order to return it. Don¡¯t know if it¡¯s worth the savings to buy a refurbished phone again.
            "
"27","So I recieved the iPhone 7 Plus a day ago and when I unboxed it there was a dent on the corner of the phone then an hour later the screen stopped responding to touch
            "
"28","<U+00A0>Phone Was Delivered On Time I Love The New Delivery System Phone Works & Is In Good Condition Received Charger W| The Phone My Sims Card Wasn¡¯t Compatible So I Will Have To Buy One I Would Reccommend For Now Because I Love It If Anything Happens I Will Update
            "
"29","Lost my old phone. Bought this and I¡¯ve been more than satisfied!! Looking for a seven plus? Buy this one!! I did get it on a cyber Monday so I paid 300.00 not bad at all great battery life. No problems at all
            "
"30","Bad service my iphone was scratch and Also the charger does not work. Bad service really bad service
            "
"31","<U+00A0>I was most definitely scared to purchase this phone off of amazon in fear of getting scammed but it was definitely worth it. Phone came in great condition, also came with a charger just In case if this is your first iPhone you don¡¯t have to worry about that. Both front and back camera work just fine, over all very much worth the price
            "
"32","The phone worked just fine for 2 weeks then all of a sudden, the service stopped.  I called T-mobile and they helped trouble shoot it.  They said whoever I got this phone from did not finish paying it off therefore, the IMEI is blocked from their service.  Now I have to return this and I better get 100% of my money back.  Can't believe they're selling phones that haven't been paid for.  Are these all stolen??
            "
"33","The phone came like new and no I am not some robot or automated message but this phone came like brand new. I¡¯m used to using my little 5s and upgrading to this was so weird at first I received it yesterday and USPS took all day because of hurricane micheal or whatever. But it comes in this usps box (if you are in the United States) and has another box inside of that usps box and the phone was in there wrapped in a protective plastic. Came with a charger and works with metro Pcs and T-Mobile I would recommend 300% <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>
            "
"34","The phone came with very small scratches on the screen, and one little nick in the hardware on the bottom of the phone. Was to be expected since it is a refurbished phone. My main problem is that the product is supposed to be unlocked, however it is carrier locked to T Mobile.
            "
"35","Unfortunately the phone had a slight issue with the microphone. It was working badly and the person on the other side of the phone couldn't hear me very well. So getting the mic replaced. Also it had a tiny almost not visible chip on the bottom left corner of the phone, so it clearly got hit. Definitely not a new phone although for the price good. But be aware that it might not be perfect.
            "
"36","I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PHONE! I GOT THIS PHONE ON 87%!!! Only one of the speakers work at the bottom!! Rip off. Never again.
            "
"37","Very nice, no scratches. Now I just need a Sim card! +1
            "
"38","I was very afraid buying electronically devices on Amazon because I have never done so before but I tried it out for once and trust me, I don't regret it one bit! The phone delivery was on time, the phone came in immaculate conditions, a mean no scratch or dent. The screen was clean ect. The phone is working amazingly!I would recommend buying items from this particular seller!
            "
"39","Purchased the black back in December for $350. Came looking brand new without a single scratch or dent. Popped my Cricket sim in and have had no problems ever since. When I received it the battery health was 84% (expected for older phones) and hasn¡¯t went down since.
            "
"40","the first month was great after that i noticed the touch methods weren't working properly i couldn't access apps and move things around because it wasn't reading. then my phone wouldn't hold a charge or stay charged took hours to get to 10% now I'm 3 months in and phone less because the phone completely stopped working. and i can't return or replace it ... IM SO DISAPPOINTED
            "
"41","This phonw came with a lot of issiues the battery was drawing and I mean drawing so I took it to apple and they just said I can do a battery replacement but I would have to pay extra when I just bought this new phone then about a month later the phone could not find my  carrier so I traded it in to apple and I can¡¯t even get my money back most likely I¡¯m screwed
            "
"42","It looks brand new.
            "
"43","Works great, highly recommend, absolutely no issues phone was like brand new GSM fully unlocked.
            "
"44","I was so skeptical about ordering online from a company like this, considering the price. My phone came in a package and has little itty bitty scratches on the screen. Otherwise,  no other type of wear or tear. This is definitely worth the buy, people!
            "
"45","I love the phone it¡¯s great. There¡¯s just one thing I didn¡¯t like. I thought the phone was actually going to come with original apple box and apple earbuds and charger. Though it does come with a charger.
            "
"46","So far so good. Came in perfect condition! No scratches or blemishes. Very pretty. Haven't had any issues (knock on wood) all over pretty pleased with my purchase.
            "
"47","This seller is great. Phone looked like new. It recognized the other iPhone right away and activation could not have gone better. Very happy with this seller and iPhone!!!
            "
"48","I have had this product for a week, and I¡¯m thoroughly satisfied. I have bought a smartphone from amazon before and I can say this phone exceeded them all. I will write another review in 90 days!
            "
"49","I am so disappointed. The phone worked fine I took My Cricket sim card out of my iphone 6 plus and put it in here and my service worked just fine. After that I went To Use the Camera and My Phone restart for like 2 seconds, thought it was just the battery but it does it every time I open the camera on instagram, facetime, snapchat, and other social media apps. I hate this I am a Camera Person I contacted Chubbiestech and ask for a replacement but they only sent me refund instructiona thats not what I asked for
            "
"50","Phone is currently working good , it basically came brand new with no stretches, the only little problem I have is that it sometimes it¡¯s freezes but only for a few seconds .
            "
"51","Works as advertised! I'm happy with it!
            "
"52","Came in just as new! Hardly any noticble scratches or scuffs. Works great with any GSM carrier like Metropcs or T Mobile. I had no problems with connection.
            "
"53","It was a little larger than expected, but that was plus that I had not expected. I thought it wa verizon certified but iit wasn't. However the people at verizon installea a new sims card and it is working fine. No other problems.
            "
"54","Great phone works as expected
            "
"55","Received the phone today and everything appeared to be great. The phone seemed to be in good condition. After a few minutes of checking everything out, realized the main camera has zero function. The main camera does not work AT ALL. Only the front camera works. Very dissatisfied and don¡¯t want to want for an exchange. My boyfriend hasn¡¯t had a phone for 3 days now, really don¡¯t want to wait longer. Just can¡¯t believe they would sell a phone with a nonfunctional camera.
            "
"56","Celular con dano en la tarjeta principal, se dano a los 2 meses de uso.
            "
"57","There¡¯s nothing to dislike about this product!! Everything works really well its like brand new with minor scratches you can¡¯t even tell its been refurbished! I definitely recommend buying this product because its sold for a good price and it takes about four to five days to get to you.. I actually bought two IPhone 7pluses one black & the other is rose gold but overall the product is wonderful definitely worth your money!
            "
"58","Honestly I didn¡¯t know what to think when I first saw it was certified refurbished because I¡¯ve never done that before, but after receiving it. The iPhone looked brand new and functioned as so. I¡¯ve never used iPhone before but I¡¯m very much pleased with it. I haven¡¯t had any problems or even cracked the screen at all. It¡¯s a very good phone to use!
            "
"59","I purchased the 32gb iPhone 7 plus through eKings. Received it on time and it came with an apple brand charger. The exterior of the phone is in basically mint condition, just some dirt in the very small places. My AT&T sim out of my iPhone 6s worked fine and all of the features on the phone seem to work just fine. I'm not sure if it was Amazon or eKings but a 1 year warranty card came for free with the phone.I will most likely use this retailer to buy all of my future phones.
            "
"60","got 2 pieces of this iPhone and they could really pass for new.<U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FC>

"61","Looks new!! I wouldn¡¯t have even know this phone was used if the battery wouldn¡¯t drain so fast !! Come with 90 day warranty ! Phone works amazing not a Chinese phone ! ORDER URS TODAY only thing is the battery sucks and I mean it sucks so bad it drains so quickly hate hate hate that because I paid for a phone to work like new
            "
"62","I recently bought this product as my old phone was dying. The phone works as new and the battery life is nearly immaculate. The phone also came with a screen protector which surprised me. Will update upon further use.
            "
"63","Broken screen
            "
"64","My son was pleased with the product. Some visible scratches on the back.
            "
"65","so far so good the phone came with a charger no dents or scratches on the actual phone it looks practically new!! it always came with a screen protector already on the phone, the only downfall is it had a scratch on the screen protecter but no big deal at all ill just put on a new one on!! also it is indeed unlocked I now have at&t!! I would definitely recommend this seller
            "
"66","Love the phone and love how it was well packaged. My problem is that when I received the phone it was dead and didn¡¯t have the latest IOS 12.2 and that meant that I had to wait for the update to install which should¡¯ve already come been installed. Overall I loveeee this phone and the camera and everything. Thank you so much
            "
"67","Looks exactly like a brand new phone. It's the most perfect condition. No scratches or dents whatsoever! I love my Iphone7 plus and the new black color is very appealing. Holding this phone everyday gives me a sense of confidence.
            "
"68","I consider myself a veteran in having refurbished phones, since they have all i've ever bought. I have great doubts that this was refurbished at all and was probably just reset. I found gunk in the lightning port and the speakers are the worst I've ever had. I have a 2012 phone and those still have better sound quality than this 2016 7plus. the phone so far works fine, tho didn't come with headphones.
            "
"69","Good phone for good price. No scratches, no dents. Literally - like new. It was sad to see that every other part of order was not OEM. Not OEM charger, cable, box. I thought at first it will be OEM and it MIGHT be not OEM for some reasons. But I suppose it's different - you will be receiving not OEM parts and sometimes you MIGHT receive an OEM cable and etc. Overall - great phone.
            "
"70","Phone came in great condition, only one tiny nick on the top right corner. Works exactly as it should. Great price
            "
"71","thank you very much for the ipone 7 plus and I like it and thank you again.
            "
"72","Currently using the phone right now and it was a great purchase! Nothing wrong with it or anything
            "
"73","When I received the phone it worked for about 5 minutes while setting it up, then never turned on. Customer service was very short with me. I ended up taking it into apple and they said the phone was wiped. They then gave me a new one. Very unhappy with my experience.
            "
"74","Like the phones overall but my husband says his phone need charging more often then all the rest of our phones. We purchased 4 total.
            "
"75","I recieved this phone in lue of my other iphone 7's 3D touch not working. I can say that the phone came in good packaging and in great condition for being refurbished. I could not be happier. Honestly, I did not realize until after I had received the phone that it was a 7+ but regardless of that, it works as if it was brand new, no scratches or anything!
            "

"78","I only had this for about three weeks. Everything worked pretty well except that the in-ear speaker didn¡¯t work well from the start. You can barely hear the person on the other line at full volume. I took it to an Apple store, but the phone couldn¡¯t finish the audio diagnotistics twice because something was up with it. Took it to a phone repair and they couldn¡¯t see the issue with it so I decided to return this for a refund.

The sender sent it immediately, and I received the phone within 5 days it was ordered on Thursday and I got it Monday around 11
            "
"105","The iphone is not exactly refurbished, instead it should say used. There are some scratches on back and front. I am ok with some usage except front screen scratch
            "

"107","Works great!
            "
"108","Super bien la entrega en tiempo y el celular impecable, como nuevo, la bateria muy buena, me duraba todo el dia a pesar de que trabajo bastantes aplicaciones pesadas como TramViewer, Escritorio Remoto RDP, SpeedTest, IP Scanner, GS Wave, DropBox, Mega, entre otras (velocidad de navegacion muy buena) y la calidad de imagen en las fotos de excelente calidad, lamentablemente vivo en una ciudad un poco violenta y me asaltaron por lo que solo pude disfrutarlo un mes <U+0001F629>, pero el celular me encantaba y el vendedor muy cumplido, le daria la mayor dcantidad las calificaciones
            "
"109","I was excited when I first got the phone, but immediately regretted getting it. The phone keeps overheating, and it is VERY slow at charging. And there are times where the phone freezes and starts glitching. The looks and materials that came with it are good, but yeh actual phone is not.
            "
"110","Phone was sent to me with a poorly applied third party screen. It made the phone turn off randomly. I took it to the apple store where it fail their test. I had to. Return the phone. Not worth the $489.
            "
"111","Got the phone for the camera, was not disappointed. The depth option really makes your photos look professional. Would buy again.

"113","It¡¯s like new and it¡¯s amazing, I have had this phone for almost 2 months and it¡¯s great.
            "
"114","Was very skeptical about ordering this phone. Went through hundreds of reviews and I had a fear that the phone would be delivered not unlocked or broken, however, so the phone works seamlessly so far. Set it up with my carrier and there are no viable problems yet so I do recommend this phone to everyone
            "
"115","It came in with a charger some cards and the sim tool to take it out and the phone was in perfect condition since (I got black ) and it looks very good and I got it about 7 hours ago and been using it since then and nothings been odd and I am very happyUpdate .

"118","Got the phone and it worked good for about a day, then I started experiencing problems with the screen having dark spots in it.
            "
"119","The iPhone is in great condition, great battery, great everything really. Only problem is, it¡¯s nit gsm unlocked. It was locked to att and when I went to go get it unlocked they said the phone wasn¡¯t fully paid for. So I just switched to att service because I needed a new service anyways, but the phone was not unlocked and can not be unlocked.
            "
"120","Great product, came exactly as it said. Works fine with no bugs. Does work with Straight Talk SIM cards

"121","fine
            "
"122","I bought this phone thinking it was unlocked to find out that it was unlocked to only T-Mobile  users only. Lucky I was able to get it unlocked to any carrier
            "
"123","Ok
            "
"124","I love this phone so much! It works just like it is new. It doesn¡¯t have any scratches or marks anywhere on the phone. This is a great deal! And if you don¡¯t like it you get your money back in 90 days!!

            "
"132","I wanted to wait a couple of months before writing a review, as I was skeptical about ordering electronics via the internet. I am extremely pleased and impressed with this phone. It came in perfect condition.
            "
"133","Other than it not being compatable with Verizon , it works 100% fine no scratches screen protector already on and is a perfect fit with me other than having to switch to AT&T now.
            "
"134","I bought it and after a few days it stopped working. I should have listened to the bad reviews. I guess I was not one of the lucky ones. I am going to return it now.
            "
"135","Work just fine
            "
"136","Looks exactly like a brand new iPhone but isn¡¯t waterproof. Also original screen has been changed to a lesser Chinese screen which gets scratched easily. And broke fast. Battery capacity is worned out as if you are using n IPhone 6. All you are getting is a lookalike IPhone 7 which is not an actual IPhone 7. Customer service is terrible as they are not an actual Prime product. You are dealing with a 3rd party associate.
            "
"137","El celular venia con barias peladuras como q si lo abian usado
            "
"138","It¡¯s came with a charger and box. Good battery life came with a glass screen protector. Like brand new!!

            "
"142","Was kinda scared of ordering a phone on here just because I didn¡¯t want it to be some sort of scam but it was definitely worth it. Phone arrived in near perfect condition, on time, and I love it.
            "
"143","Came on time and in brand new condition, works perfectly, no complaints at all.
            "
"144","I absolutely love this phone! My first iPhone ever and I¡¯m very happy with my decision! The phone was packaged very well and not damaged. The battery life was over 70% when I turned it on. This phone is very easy to use! <U+0001F601>

            "
"147","this is absolutely amazing. the phone came wrapped in plastic, in a high quality box. the phone is basically brand new. no scratches at all, not FAKE, and works 100 percent perfectly. if you are looking for an iphone 7 plus buy this one!! absolutely perfect! it came with a new perfect adapter, and charger. the only thing missing is headphones, which really isnt that important. there are low reviews on this product and i dont understand why. perfect. love it.
            "
"148","I¡¯m kind of upset, the speaker on the left side doesn¡¯t work at all, and it take forever to charge<U+0001F641> but that¡¯s okay other than that it¡¯s a really good phone.
            "
"149","This phone did not last me one day, I started seeing issues right away. The iPhone powers off on it's own multiple times a day.
            "
"150","This is he first time I¡¯m writing a review I am really pleased with the phone but it did break the first time I dropped it other than that it works great the phone came with a screen protector that I removed if I would have kept it on it probably would have broke preforming wise it works great
            "
"151","Got it for my girlfriend. The phone seemed just about spotless but the battery was jussssst sliding by their ¡°80%¡± or better battery level with an 81, so the battery at some point will need replaced. Other than than no issues whatsoever
            "
"152","It's ok. It had a nick on the side.
            "

"156","Good buy and Great condomino for the price.
            "
"157","Like the phone size but everyone kept saying that they could not here me and it kept freezing up.otherwize I would have kept it.
            "
"158","It looks and works as good as new so far. It's been about a week. Only had a tiny barely noticeable scratch on the top but definitely worth half the price. Strongly recommended so far (will update after the warranty ends).
            "
"159","Excelente
            "
"160","The phone at first I thought was fake, but I don¡¯t think it is. The charger however was cheap and broke shortly after. It works like a regular iphone but the home button is unsteady.
            "
"161","The battery life was good at the beginning but with use it just deteriorated and the audio is so bad I can¡¯t talk on the phone with earbuds but all in all it¡¯s a good phone.
            "
"162","This phone is not as good as I expected. I have bought refurbished phones from other websites before. But the quality is better than this one and the price is almost the same.
            "
"163","Amazing
            "
"164","I was very hesitant to get this phone but I love it, and everything worked as it should. Battery life is better than expected, camera is great, and it a single scratch in it.
            "

"166","I had this for about two months and then it completely stopped charging altogether... And before that when i first got it the battery life would go down way too fast...
            "
"167","Phone was ok but other things like headphones and connectors, charging cables were missing in the box.
            "
"168","Works fine no scratches or damage. Arrived on time too.
            "
"169","It kept getting annoying how the price on the phone kept getting raised I¡¯m looking at the current price right now and I probably wouldn¡¯t have bought it for that price. I would give it 5 stars but they delayed it twice. But overall the phone is really nice.
            "
"170","PISSED OFF.  Phone was not unlocked and does not work with sprint. I bought this for my wife for Christmas and now she is very disappointed. Thanks a lot

"177","everything worked out great I was scared it was gonna be locked but it wasn¡¯t but I did have to switch my account from boost to metro pcs because the phone is gsm unlocked but everything else was coo ! 5 Starts
            "
"178","I love this phone. I don't think it's worth the price Aplle sells them for, but this sellers price seems much more reasonable. Only found one flaw in the refurbishing, and it was minor. Not even worth complaining about.
            "
"179","Got this for 394 instead of 418 cuz of Black Friday . But the price kept going dowwwn after days of Black Friday. It was a good deal. Got it with the clear case and glass protector

I¡¯m happy it¡¯s the original glass and not aftermarket considering the phone is IP67 water resistant from the factory. There are no corner impact marks and the back had only a slight abrasion. Battery health is 96% which is pretty decent for an older phone. It functions well I have it fully set up and will update if anything goes wrong. Very happy with the purchase.
            "
"425","I am very very pleased with my  purchase there was no scratch no I didn¡¯t it¡¯s very it¡¯s waterproof the camp more quality is really green the battery is good and I switched over to my T-Mobile and it worked I am very very very please thank you .

"435","I wouldn¡¯t buy this phone! Especially if your provider is straight talk. It was as a hassle to transfer my phone number over. And when I got the phone I have problems with my data so I took it to the IMechanic and they told me that the motherboard was as screwed up and my phone was out for recall. So I returned the phone and I had to pay for the return shipping. So I wouldn¡¯t buy this phone if I was you!
            "

"460","I bought this phone about a month and a half ago and as a previous Android user I am very happy I switched. An iPhone is very user friendly to most people and it was very easy to switch over, which was something I was worried about. The plus has a much bigger screen which is good for people who watch a lot of videos or play a lot of games, which is something I've started doing since getting this phone. Before buying this phone, I did a lot of research into it because I've never had an iPhone before. So, I asked my friends to do a survey, I did a comparison on the US Cellular website, I spoke with many people who worked at the phone stores, and I looked a lot of reviews online for both products.One thing I don't like about the 7 is that I can't charge it and listen to music at the same time because there is only one location to plug something in, but there are more positives that outweigh the negative. Another thing, that¡¯s just a personal issue is, some of the things I was used to doing on an Android can¡¯t be done on an iPhone. So, I catch myself doing some of those things, which can sometimes mess up what I was trying to do, but I¡¯m slowly but surely adapting to the change. One positive thing is that it is water resistant, not that I get it wet often but it helps if my hand gets wet and then I go to grab my phone. I'm able to connect with friends in different ways then I could with an Android, such as group text, FaceTime, find my friends, etc. I'm also able to access different apps such as flashlight, iTunes, apple watch, etc. One last thing that I enjoy a lot about the iPhone is the on and off switch for sound. It comes in handy when doing school work or sleeping. I'm able to switch it off instead of turning it down without fear of me turning it up in my pocket.After having an Android for so many years I was very hesitant about switching to an iPhone, but after having it for almost two months I'm very satisfied and glad I switched. All the worry and troubles that I thought I was going to have switching were slim to none. All in all, I don't know if I would ever switch back.
            "
"461","I¡¯ve had this phone since the day it was available. It¡¯s been sturdy and works well. I love the bigger phones . I usually upgrade each time a new iPhone comes out but this latest uprages (8plus and X) just don¡¯t quit cut it so i am sticking to the 8plus for now.Btw I added a photo of my dog taken on the 7 plus because the photos are awesome on these phones and who doesn¡¯t love a puppy?
            "
"462","Love it
            "
"463","This iPhone 7 Plus is a moderate improvement compared to previous models. If you are a big fan of larger screens and taking photos, this iPhone might be for you. However, keep in mind that this iPhone is certified refurbished through Amazon so there might be minor scratches and dents. Also, the battery and headphone port has been a major concern for users.ScreenThe screen for this iPhone 7 Plus is like the screen of the iPhone 6 Plus. Both screens are 5.5 inches with the same resolution. However, the iPhone 7 Plus is said to be 25 percent brighter according to Apple.CameraThe iPhone 7 Plus has an impressive camera that offers many added benefits. It features two different lenses, one of them enables optical zoom by switching from one lens to the other and 10x digital zoom, unlike the previous models that offer 5x digital zoom. Also, the quality of photos is more enhanced as the iPhone 7 Plus offers Portrait Mode, which is a part of the iOS 10.1 update.BatteryBased on my experiences with the iPhone 6 Plus, the battery life of the iPhone 7 Plus does lasts longer. I have noticed that this depends on the usages of the iPhone 7 Plus between charges. Apple also claims that the iPhone 7 Plus last an hour longer than previous models.Headphone PortThe headphone port is the same as the iPhone 7. At first, I complained about this installment because I was not able to charge my phone and listen to music. But this became less of an issue when I used my wireless head phones. For those without headphones, this may become an issue.Overall, I had a good experience with this iPhone. It was delivered within a week and packaged nicely. Everything is operating smoothly, and the quality of my pictures are amazing. I highly recommend that you purchase this iPhone.

"464","Horrible experience trying to get warranty work on this phone. Has more bugs then an ant hill. Almost tempted to throw it in the trash. Apple site is down most of the time and if you have questions it will take at least an hour on hold to get someone who knows less than you.
            "
"465","UPDATE !!! phone is responding to touch , battery life is decent I charge my phone maybe twice throughout the day , phone never died on me once , phone dosest get hot at all . No glitches everything came packaged nicely . Didn¡¯t come with headphones or a regular charger also not the regular box . But it still came with a generic charger that¡¯s working as well , also came with a screen protector. No scratches nore signs of use . I¡¯m actually using the phone to do this review and I¡¯m about 2 weeks in . # BuySpry was my seller ! I recommend this phone from the seller ( BuySpry )

"466","This phone is not even worth one star, do not buy it it's horrible the worst phone since the flip phone it fails constantly does it's own thing and I threaten to throw it in the trash once or twice daily what a piece of junk do not buy
            "
"467","I was quite impressed by the referbished iPhone 7 Plus I received. It looks pristine! There were no major nicks or scratches, it looked brand new!  In addition, it functions seamlessly. I am so glad I took a risk and bought my first refurbished phone. I saved money and helped save the environment. Definitely worth it and would highly recommend it to others :)*Regarding the other reviews, the product description states that ear pods are not included. So don't be surprised or upset. You can buy them on Amazon if you want them.

"472","This is my first Iphone and it has been nothing but a collosal piece of junk.  There are so many defects and glitches that it is almost not useabe.  Locks up and can't end a phone call, bluetooth is sporadic, sometimes you can import pics..sometimes tyou can't....Ohhh then there is SIRI,,,what a complete joke..absolutey inaccurate and the searches are so far off the mark that you should make sure you have another person with an Android nearby if you need relevant information. Can't figure out why ANYBODY would buy these horrifically stupid ""smart"" phones.
            "
"473","Phone came and looked brand new and was unlocked as advertised. But upon using it the phone just wouldn't charge. I asked about the 90 day warranty and they said they had no more in stock so they couldn't help me.

            "
"479","I ordered this phone excited to finally upgrade from my barely useable iPhone 6 only to receive the phone to see there are SCRATCHES and CRACKS in the phone. At first glance I didn't notice until I realized that i could literally FEEL the cracks in the phone. And now the product is out of stock. Are you serious? Do better.

"482","The iPhone 7 plus is a good phone to have it has a nice big 5.5 inch screen . The pros about this phone is the quality camera  takes very high quality pictures, has nice quality display , long battery life  up to 10 to 12 hours it depends on the usage how much you use it , last but not least this phone is easy to use
            "

            "
"502","The IPhone 7+ fits better in my hand compared to the regular sized version! I no longer feel like a giant with a tiny phone! The camera quality is great and portrait mode is awesome. My only gripe is that the IPhone doesn¡¯t come with any headphones, but I knew that before I bought it so I wasn¡¯t upset.
            "
"503","I love this phone but the touchscreen being unresponsive at times messes it up for me. Awesome camera, sound and quality. I can barely write this review as it will become unresponsive and I will have to spam the home button or power button then type unlock my phone again for the screen to work only a few more minutes again. I tried resetting the phone and hard restarting didn¡¯t work. It has this problem even with the case off of it.Update: This phone has also been nit picking up my voice and other can not hear me during calls. It will cut out and they can hear noises such as tapping or scratching.
            "
"504","Phone is great condition but the battery life is sub par or a certified referbished phone my phone only holds 94% it¡¯s original charge ones it gets off 100% it drops to 90 so fast I have to have a battery case and battery pack with me at work to survive being in a service industry my phone is my life line and it¡¯s a bummer to get the battery replaced is 3 to 4 weeks from Apple and I can¡¯t not have a phone that long pic included to show the battery is not a top performance for a certified phone

"505","Phone is in great condition and works perfectly
            "
"506","I bought this for my little sister (who lives in Jamaica) as a graduation present a year ago and waited 1 1/2 yrs to write the review just to be sure it was a worthy product. I'm an Android user but she wanted an iPhone so I did my best in choosing a good quality one. She absolutely loves her phone! It has endured falls without cracking and water splashes by the sink without 'drowning'. Teenagers are aggressive phone users so for her to have had no issues with a used phone after all this time is impressive.
            "
"507","After reading reviews I was a bit hesitant to order this because I worried the phone wouldn't work with my carrier. But after getting this phone I realize that more than likely people don't realize what kind of phone plan they have and what requirements are needed. a GSM unlocked phone is a phone that is not hooked to ANY cell phone provider. This means that it can be used with a cell phone provider that you use a SIM card for. I got the phone, put my SIM card in, it came fully charged and I was ready to go. It hooked to my provider, I was able to text, send pictures through text messaging and my data worked perfectly. Great product for the price.

I have had zero problems with this phone until today  five days later I¡¯m taking photos and I realize I cannot turn off the camera sound because this phone is from Japan and not an American phone. For some reason Japan requires all sulfones to make a sound when taking photos. I take photos a lot and I hate every time I take a photo it makes a loud sound.I am tempted to return the phone.

"568","Faster than expected delivery, although USPS did all they can to prevent that. The phone itself is in satisfactory condition, although I am a bit disappointed with the amount of scratches on the screen. This doesn't take away from the functionality at all, the phone works as it should and haven't ran into any issues yet. At a decently low price this is worth a shot if you ask me!

"593","This is the worst phone i have ever purchased from Amazon. This cannot be certified refurbished and could not have been checked for functionality. The screen looses responsiveness, then it selects other letters or numbers by mistake which makes it difficult to dial a number or send a simple text. Another thing is that people cannot hear when you speak as if something is wrong with the microphone. Cosmetic condition is 8.5/10 but the phone is of no use. BUYERS BEWARE!!!
            "
"594","Bought direct at the Apple Store. Love the technology but Apple Care support has been universally and consistently disappointing.  If you don't have one of Apple's preferred carriers you may find  some infuriating limitations. Coming from android the learning curve has been horrible. Apple support are nice enough but are too often clueless.  Never, ever, had this many problems with my cheap old android which I still must turn to because Apple Care  could not resolve issues is the most rudimentary functions such as MMS messages to androids.  The device has cost me hundreds of lost hours in lost time.
            "
"595","My first iPhone. I was an adroid user my whole life. I never really considered an iPhone because of the price. Now that android and Apple are comparable in price, I went ahead and tried it. I love it! So simple! The battery lasts all day too! I can make it last a couple days if I¡¯m not really using it.

"596","I have a refurbished iPhone 7 Plus I bought directly from T-Mobile. Mine was in great condition and has been working perfectly. I upgraded from the iPhone 6 and it¡¯s nearly night and day.I wanted the plus cause of the optical zoom and the large screen size. I¡¯m very happy with the phone so far and I recommend it if your looking to upgrade from a 5, 6, or 6s.
            "
"597","Product says that its unlocked when I was sent a locked phone. As soon as I tried to set it up with my T-Mobile sim card, the phone told me that it was already under another carrier. Fake advertisement. Don't buy unless you're willing to possibly be sent a locked phone. Too bad that I bought for such a high price and it turn out not to be unlocked.

"599","This phone has so many great functions for either a working adult or a teenager. This phone provides a great camera to take very realistic photos. Some phones leave you with very grainy pictures but this phone is very clear. However you might find when you zoom into something it starts to become a little but grainy. I personally own this phone and love it. It works well, its good for photo taking, and has a great exterior look to it.
